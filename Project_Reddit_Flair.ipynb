I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for \"extra\" documents that weren\\'t requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!\\n\\nWe drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we\\'re nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn\\'t greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.\\n\\nHowever, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn\\'t open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy\\'s  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.\\n\\nExcuse me, what? I\\'ve never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?\\n\\nShe explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it\\'s currently 2019, there were \"crossed wires\", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn\\'t in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can\\'t have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.\\n\\nWhat is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.\\n\\nI  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in \"interaction design\", educated, and don\\'t have a criminal record.', 'r/TooAfraidToAsk India edition', \"Hello India.

But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  \\n\\nSo ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don\\'t know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions\\' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  \\n\\nThe prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are \"materialistic\" and we are somehow more \"spiritualistic\". I couldn\\'t disagree more.  \\n\\nRather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called \"spiritual\" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what \"ancient India\" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how \"our Indian culture\" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  \\n\\nNow don\\'t get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that \"the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks\" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I\\'ve met - so long as you don\\'t discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming \"evil\" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how \"good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is\") while the one\\'s we have *vilified* as the \"ignorant western people\" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  \\n\\nJust a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  \\n\\n**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *\"Vimanas\"* (spacecrafts) or the best *\"Brahmastras\"* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP \"FORWARD\" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as \"cool\" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno.

If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  \\n  \\n**[NP] - Non-political**  \\n  \\nThese are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  \\n \\nThis is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  \\n  \\n**[R] - Reddiquette**  \\n  \\nWhen this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    \\n  \\nJokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.\\n  \\nThis can be used for both political and non-political topics.  \\n  \\n**[ASK] - AskIndia**  \\n  \\nThese are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  \\n  \\nIf the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  \\n  \\n**Science & Technology** \\n\\nThis flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   \\n \\nIf Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  \\nIf the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  \\n\\n**Policy & Economy**\\n  \\nThese flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  \\n\\n**Business & Finance**  \\n\\nThese flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  \\n  \\n**Entertainment** \\n\\nEntertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  \\n  \\nThis flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   \\n \\n**Sports and Food** \\n\\nSports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  \\n\\n**AMA**\\n  \\nAMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  \\n  \\n**In-Depth**\\n\\nThis flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic.

Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...\\n\\n-------\\n\\n\"Letters To My Ex\" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.\\n\\nI think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of \"Notes From The Underground\" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.\\n\\nAnyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.\\n\\nThe original book is located here: \\n\\nhttps://www.amazon.in/Letters-My-Ex-Nikita-Singh-ebook/dp/B07938VDLS/ref=sr_1_2_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535473766&sr=1-2&keywords=letters+to+my+ex\\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nThese are my notes:\\n\\n# On the Book\\n\\nThis books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.\\n\\nAs the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.\\n\\nShe panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. \\n\\n# January \\nThere\\'s a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.\\n\\nThen we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, \"Do you like being ignored?\"  Rolls her eyes!\\n\\nAnd then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?\\n\\n# February \\nFrom a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  \\n\\n\\nThere is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.\\n\\n\\nYes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else\\'s fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.\\n\\n# March\\n\\nThis is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.\\n\\nShe has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.\\n\\nNeedhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. \\n\\n# April\\nThe first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that \"I don\\'t know\" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.\\n\\nShe talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, \"Where do we go from here\"? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. \\n\\nAfter having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika\\'s kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.\\n\\n# May\\nMay is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.\\n\\nThen there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.\\n\\nThen there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that\\'s that. \\n\\n# June\\nThey have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.\\n\\nShe is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.\\n\\nThere is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.\\n\\n#July \\nThe one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi\\'s need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi\\'s talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!\\n\\nNeedhi\\'s friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don\\'t know how things already are!\\n\\nThen finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.\\n\\n# August\\nShe has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won\\'t. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.\\n\\nAbhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.\\n\\nShe felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.\\n\\n# September\\nShe is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.\\n\\nShe admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.\\n\\nThe one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.\\n\\n# October\\nShe finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.\\n\\nTrust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. \\n\\nEven though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.\\n\\n# November\\nAbhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.\\n\\nAbhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.\\n\\nTheir idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It\\'s not conditional, it\\'s a contract.\\n\\n# December\\nShe feels 19 again.\\n\\nThey have a set of promises one is about playing devil\\'s advocate.\\n\\nThey are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing!

As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within.

I replied without reading this person\\'s entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I\\'m reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes\\n\\n1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:\\n * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.\\n * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.\\n\\n2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:\\n * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).\\n * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.\\n * \\'Exit\\', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions\\n\\n3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.\\n\\n4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period \"post-liberalisation\" for each economy:\\n * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|\\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\\nKorea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|\\nBGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|\\nThailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|\\nIndonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|\\nMalaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|\\nChina|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|\\nVietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|\\nIndia|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|\\n\\n5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:\\n * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.\\n * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.\\n\\n * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India\\'s domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India\\'s share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)\\n\\n * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.\\n\\n**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I\\'ll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction.

There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).\\n\\n#Q: How do I know what flair to use?\\n\\nA: Use common sense, for example:\\n\\n* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. \\n\\n* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. \\n\\n* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. \\n\\n* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.\\n\\n* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.\\n\\n* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. \\n\\n* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.\\n\\n\\n#Q: How do I apply the flairs?\\n\\nA: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.\\n**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png\\n\\nIf you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.\\n\\n* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]\\n* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]\\n* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]\\n* Scheduled: [Scheduled]\\n* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]\\n* Sports: [Sports], [SP]\\n* Policy: [Policy]\\n* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]\\n* Food: [Food], [FO]\\n* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]\\n\\n#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?\\n\\nA: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. \\n\\n#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?\\n\\nA: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. \\n\\nIf we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR: Nope!

Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi\\'s style of \\'winning\\' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.\\n\\nSo, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!\\n\\nSo, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?\\n\\nThen we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?\\n\\nOnly when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.\\n\\nIndia was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people\\'s full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn\\'t create the conditions for dignified development.\\n\\nIncredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose\\'s family\\'s movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. \\n\\nThe Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don\\'t think so. That\\'s how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.\\n\\nIt is the loot of India\\'s pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.\\n\\nIf India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it\\'s precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.\\n\\nThe economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.\\n\\nI received this message.

After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.\\n\\nAs a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!\\n\\nHow does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2\\xa0The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.\\n\\nAlthough the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3\\n\\nThis changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4\\xa0Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5\\n\\nBut economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.\\n\\nI believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7\\n\\nI shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?\\n\\nLet's begin with the Mughals\\n\\nIndia's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8\\xa0During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9\\xa0India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10\\n\\nIn 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11\\n\\nIt took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12\\xa0What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.\\n\\nIndia was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century\\n\\nIndia was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13\\xa0It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?\\n\\nDespite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14\\xa0and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15\\n\\nThere is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16\\xa0There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”\\n\\nDid the British Raj impoverish India?\\n\\nIndia's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.\\n\\nNationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17\\n\\nBritain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18\\n\\nIn recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19\\n\\nThey also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20\\xa0If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.\\n\\nIndia begins to re-industrize\\n\\nIndian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.”\\xa022\\xa0The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.\\n\\nBy Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).\\n\\nWhy didn't an industrial revolution occur?\\n\\nOne of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.\\n\\nAmiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24\\xa0If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25\\xa0An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26\\xa0But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.\\n\\nUnlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.\\n\\nWhat is the verdict on British rule?\\n\\nDid the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.\\n\\nOdd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27\\xa0Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28\\n\\nAlthough Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.\\n\\nIndependence and 'License Raj'\\n\\nAfter Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.\\n\\nJawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?\\n\\nI think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.\\n\\nNehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.\\n\\nEven more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.\\n\\nLarge business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29\\n\\nThe system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.\\n\\nAlthough it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30\\n\\n“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32\\xa0It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.\\n\\nIndia after the Reforms\\n\\nAlthough there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33\\n\\nIndians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.\\n\\nThere has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.\\n\\nThe world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.\\n\\nSome lessons\\n\\nNeoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.\\n\\nBut this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.\\n\\nAfter Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.\\n\\nIndia embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.\\n\\nIndia's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.\\n\\nSince politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.\\n\\nBut India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.\\n\\nWill capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.\\n\\nThe curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.\\n\\nDoes culture matter?\\n\\nCultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34\\n\\nDeepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35\\xa0David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36\\n\\nWhile institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.\\n\\nThus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37\\xa0It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.\\n\\nWhen seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.\\n\\nI find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.\\n\\nOur continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Ok, so my classmate from school got a new Mercedes S class.

A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.\\n\\nThe percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.\\n\\nThe burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.\\n\\nBroadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.\\n\\nHow fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.', 'Anyone on this subreddit appearing for any upsc interview, prelims or any other upsc exam this year?\\nDo you think it will be possible to hold the exams as they were scheduled or chances of a delay are high?\\nAlso has this pandemic disrupted your preparation?', \"Hi, I have a question for people well versed with flight cancellation rules.

He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it\\'s 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.\\n\\nHowever, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the \"elders\", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother\\'s and the majority of the \"edlers\" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however \"allowed\" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.\\n\\nAbsolutely preposterous move, but this isn\\'t unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.\\n\\nAs I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. \\n\\nThe second option, is to give in to his mother\\'s wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the \"family\" insisting that he go to work isn\\'t really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. \\n\\nIn IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?\\n\\nAdditonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(\\n\\nPlease keep the comments constructive.

The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\\\\*\\\\*.\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \\\\- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :\\n\\n1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**\\n2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.\\n3. **Putting in a process of \"Hands On\" education and not  \"Hands free\" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **\"Hands On\"** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **\"PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS\" , \" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**\"  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via \"Interested people\". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying \"HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE\" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.\\n\\n**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be \"leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways\" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of \"PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT\". The push for higher fees with minimal \"restraint\" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both \"Sociologically and systematically\".**\\n\\nA total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSources used :\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1.

About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.\\n\\nThere are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Source- Belong](https://preview.redd.it/5qz6wrviz6d31.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=709e48183708ea32d16c66286c57beab08720676)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **THE ROAD AHEAD**\\n\\nThe National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned\\n\\n \\n\\nCapital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.\\n\\nInvestment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector\\n\\n \\n\\n[Continue Reading](https://medium.com/@anupamasingh_12727/what-is-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-india-4c72b14729c7?utm_source=MEDUIM_REDDIT&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=gajanandswami)', \"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.\\n\\nThese are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?\\n\\nFor as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?\\n\\nThey say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.\\n\\nI yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.\\n\\nConsidering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.\\n\\nIn case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?\\n\\n[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).\\n\\nIn case you wonder what are these commons I so talk about, feel free to check this [6-minutes' short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pRS9167vk) or [24-minutes' long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cKrcQ30518) explanations.\\n\\nIf you so happen to think everything is fine & will be fine, [here's also a little something for you to consider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX3M8Ka9vUA).\\n\\nIf you wish to binge a bit more, check out [how & why the City should be a Commons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3itmhDuem8) or [a summary of commoning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ake8u8tpR5U).\\n\\nAfter that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.\\n\\nProposals:—\\n\\n* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.\\n* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.\\n* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.\\n* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.\\n* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.\\n* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.\\n* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.\\n* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.\\n* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.\\n* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons\\n* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).\\n* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).\\n* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.\\n* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.\\n* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.\\n* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.\", 'Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I\\'ll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it\\'s just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I\\'m hurt more than I show.\\n\\nThe anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can\\'t concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I\\'m numb and soulless from inside. \\n\\nI was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don\\'t know why, what am I doing. \\n\\nNowadays for me a \"good day\" is the one in which I\\'m less hurt and less dying from inside. I don\\'t think there\\'s anything called \"happiness\" it\\'s just a myth in my opinion. \\n\\nI even read \\'The subtle art of not giving a fuck\\' it helped me for sometime but now I\\'m again back to square one. \\n\\nWhy is that all of a sudden all I\\'m thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don\\'t you guys have anything else to discuss. We\\'re just 18 why can\\'t we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, \"ohh what if I die single\" \"ohh why I\\'m a nice guy\" \"ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don\\'t wanna graduate single\" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. \\n\\nPre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I\\'m surrounded by is \"relationship goals\" why is my generation so much into this \"my soul mate\" shit can\\'t they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a \"shoulder to cry on\" \"another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day\" more interested in \"opposite gender\" if you don\\'t have any \"opposite gender bestie\" then you\\'re a piece is shit, if you don\\'t have a \"significant other\" you\\'re good for nothing, if you\\'re a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you\\'re not worth \"dating\". \\n\\nAnd what\\'s wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start \"liking\" the other person then you \"propose\" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start \"seeing\" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you\\'re automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being \"girlfriend/boyfriend\".\\n\\nI\\'m just losing it all, I don\\'t want to be in a relationship I don\\'t even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that\\'s what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can\\'t focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? \\n\\nI\\'ve decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.\\n\\n1) I\\'ll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.\\n\\n2) I\\'ll try my best to focus back on my career.\\n\\n3) I\\'ll try \"pleasure-mastery\" therapy.\\n....\\n\\nWill add if you guys advice something worth it.', 'Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.\\n\\nHowever, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?\\n\\n**Indicators of Concern**\\n\\n*Employability*\\n\\nThe National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. \\n\\nThe report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. \\n\\nThe go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. \\n\\n*Output*\\n\\nThe other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. \\n\\nThe SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. \\n\\nAccording to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). \\n\\nWe see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.\\n\\n**A Chain of Causes**\\n\\n*Postgraduate Education*\\n\\nResearch output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. \\n\\nAt the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. \\n\\nThis data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. \\nThe AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. \\n\\n*Throttled Funds*\\n\\nThe dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. \\nInternational Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%\\n. \\n\\n*Teacher Numbers*\\n\\nAbove, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. \\n\\nTwo other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.\\n\\nUsing general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. \\n\\nWith better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.\\n\\n**Conclusions**\\n\\nThe lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.\\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n**Sources**\\n\\n1.\\t[“National Employability Report - Engineers Annual Report 2015” – Aspiring Minds](http://www.aspiringminds.com/sites/default/files/National%20Employability%20Report%20-%20Engineers%202015_0.pdf)\\n\\n2.\\t[All India Survey on Higher Education (2013-14), Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India](http://aishe.nic.in/aishe/viewDocument.action?documentId=196)\\n\\n3.\\t[AICTE Statistics Dashboard:\\nFigures for year 2014-15, Engineering and Technology Institutions](http://www.aicte-india.org/dashboard/pages/dashboard.php?year=2&institutiontype=1&level=1&program=Engineering+and+Technology&state=1&Minority=1&Women=1&dashboard=)\\n\\n4.\\t[SEVIS By The Numbers, August 2015:\\nStudent Exchange and Visitor Program, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report/2015/sevis_bythenumbers_aug15.pdf)\\n\\n5.\\t[SCImago Journal & Country Rank](http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?area=2200&category=0&region=all&year=all&order=cd&min=1000&min_type=it)\\n\\n6.\\t[OECD – Science Technology and Industry Outlook 2014: Country Profiles – Comparative performance of national innovation systems – Indexes](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MSTI_PUB)\\n\\n7.\\t[International Comparative Study: Engineering Education in India\\nSouth Asia Human Development Sector, World Bank](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/04/17844321/international-comparative-study-engineering-education-india)\\n\\n8.\\t[National Science Board Science & Engineering Indicators 2016\\nChapter 4, Table 4-4](http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsb20161/uploads/1/7/tt04-04.pdf)\\n\\n', \"So, one of my friends' is a student of FTII, Pune.

This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  \\n\\nNGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).\\n\\nThere have been many such organizations that would fit today\\'s definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer\\'s cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte\\'s organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.\\n\\nThe problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of \"filling the gaps in services\" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.\\n\\nThe first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI\\'s mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.\\n\\nThis American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... \"jasoosi kar raha hai kya?\" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: \"Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.\"\\n\\nAnd indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.\\n\\nThe point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI\\'s request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents\\' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn\\'t get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the \"greater good\", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That\\'s just how the priorities shook out.\\n\\nOne can almost understand the appetite for these sort of \"arrangements\" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India\\'s prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.\\n\\nThe NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi\\'s regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.\\n\\nSo now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It\\'s also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?\\n\\nThe second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.\\n\\nMike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.\\n\\nThe solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.\\n\\nOver 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.\\n\\nWhat could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini\\'s forces!\\n\\nA very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as \"fascist\" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.\\n\\nCan we begin to imagine a time when the \"marginalized\" sections of our own society aren\\'t deliberately kept \"marginalized\" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn\\'t left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?', '', \"The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science & Technology, Environment, Forests & Climate Change, chaired by Jairam Ramesh is preparing a  report on 'Environment, Climate Change & Public Health'. \\n\\nSend your inputs to [rsc-st@sansad.nic.in](mailto:rsc-st@sansad.nic.in). \\n\\nSource : [https://twitter.com/Jairam\\\\_Ramesh/status/1248495220821356551](https://twitter.com/Jairam_Ramesh/status/1248495220821356551)\", '', 'Fuck all religion.

We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand.

I don't see the relevance of trying to go through the drudgery again and again. I beg for some patience on your part to go through this post.\\n\\nAt 30 years of age with no set path for a career, I am utterly useless. I can't even provide for myself, let alone take care of others.\\n\\nI am a 30-year-old, so-called general category lower-class family, man. Haha, how pathetic, isn't it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI was a good student till Xth, and then the slow downhill started in my scores. Struggling to pass 12th in state medium with 70% with just pass 50% in mathematics.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThen, coming from a lower-class family, there were not enough choices for me to go through - either Medical or ENgineering. I prepared for Medical taking a 1-year gap. Nothing substantial came out of it. In the end, I had to go to engineering. Because sadly, in our country, gap years are a strict no-no for any of the stakeholders and I could not waste 1 more year.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDid [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) in engineering in Applied Electronics & Instrumentation from one of the 'good' private colleges in Bhubneswar, Odisha. Yes, here in Odisha - so you might have guessed my economic conditions. Passed with Average CGPA of 7.1.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNo jobs came in the engineering field. At last, I was recruited by the service company (name starts with I) and had to go \\\\\\\\ for it.  This was 6 years back.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause there was no alternate way for me. I am now the sole bread-earner of the family. My dad has retired from his job.\\n\\nTrained in Mysore - I was not from a programming background. I found it really hard to go through the training especially the advanced chapters. I had to take a retest for the final exam since I failed in the first one. In the retest, I literally had to take the help of some kind souls who took pity on me and shared their answers. I passed with a retest with minimum pass marks.\\n\\nGOt posted to Mangalore. Here, literally at the opposite side of India from where I cam from - I felt alone. Loneliness became my best friend. I avoided getting into any projects there -  be it support or development. Because I knew in my heart that I could not do it.\\n\\nAfter a gap of almost 1 year there, I was forced by some managers into a support project. In this team, seeing my utterly bad skills, they put into a 1st level support person - a triage one - someone who acts as the first point of contact for customers, records their issues, creates incidents, tickets and passes onto other teammates. Literally this for 1 year.\\n\\nThen, slowly they put me into an application support where SQL work along with a niche technology called TM1.\\n\\nBeing absolutely weak in any other technologies, let alone niche technologies - i could not really improve upon my situation.   Thus, they kept me in a bare minimum work state in this one too. because frankly I could not doa anything else.\\n\\nI remained in this project for 4.5 years, then took a transfer to Bhubaneswar. Here, I avoided again, getting into projects for 1 year or more and then was again forcibly put into a support project where Informatica, Unix, TM1, Cognos is being used. I am in this one, at present.\\n\\nHEre as well, seeing my lack of skills, I was put into a bare minimum level. My lead has literally scolded me so many times that I have become numb.\\n\\nBelow are not excuses or points to validate my inactions - they are just plain naked truths.\\n\\nNOw after all this, you and hell, I would have asked myself -\\n\\nwhat I am doing about it?\\n\\nWhat I am doing to learn new skills?\\n\\nWhat am I doing to even get into another job?\\n\\nThe answer is nothing. NOthing.  Why?\\n\\nbecause I am listless.\\n\\nI lack the memory right now to retain anything at all. I keep forgetting common things or points let aline study and become proficient in a programming language.\\n\\nI lack the logical reasoning a person has to learn to actually code.\\n\\nI lack the mathematical skills.\\n\\nNow would you believe me if I told you I had scored 100/100 in my Xth Computer Science exam - consisting of OOPS, and Blue Java.\\n\\nBut now, I know what utter waste was that - not worth 2 paise in India and in this hyper-competitive world.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSince these 6 years now, I have remained severely depressed with OCD patterns coming in as well. My memory has faded. My enthusiasm is gone for anything. Nihilism in my mind. I have tried to come out of it - I am not saying this lightly. I have tried to take away my mind on dwelling on these things and escape through any of the multiple options for a person to get some enjoyment - songs, podcasts, movies, etc.. But nothing works. I, after doing any of this, feel an existential dread as to what I have done in my life to deserve this moment of just happiness says while going to a movie or hearing to some podcasts. Guilt-tripping at its finest.\\n\\nSometimes in the middle of a day, I see something or think of something and I break down. Tears and only tears even on a bright day. At night, tears are my only friend.\\n\\nYou might think, where are my friends or family who can help me. The answer is I really do not have any such friends whom you can call at 2 am and speak your sorrow and get a shoulder to cry on.\\n\\nMy family, well - they had high hopes for me. My dad and mum had put everything to get me a good education and now I am in such a state. They are slowly coming to the conclusion that I am an utter failure.\\n\\nMy lifeline has been shredded by my inactions, my lack of skills, lack of intent to improve my situation. And now, too much time has passed. And I honestly don't see any point in it.\\n\\nSometimes I wish in my loved one's mind, I cease to exist - their memory of mine being faded in an instant - so that they do not have to go through the pain which they would feel when I take away my life.\\n\\nWhat a sorry, pathetic, selfish piece of shit stain am I? You are thinking this, aren't you? Yes, I am that. I am all of them and much more.\\n\\nBut there is literally no way to go on any further for me. I do not see any career paths for me, I am not good at anything, I lack memory, I lack any interest in any field to be proficient in.\\n\\nAll doors are shut for me now.\\n\\nToday while walking down the road, I suddenly wished what would happen if I just walk right into a front of any ofo the trucks which are passing by.\\n\\nAt least people would be spared seeing such an utter wastrel of a being which I have become to fall down further.\\n\\nThus, I have prepared everything to end it swiftly - I have put nominations with my mother's name on it for the 1 account I had. I have everything which they would need in one email - which is just waiting in my drafts to be sent.\\n\\nI have written my goodbyes to them and prayed to them - they please forget they ever had a son. To erase my memories. I am written my farewell to my loved ones.\\n\\nNow, thank you, dear readers, for going through this post.

If you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation I will report you. If you only have worn out, down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind, having merit and anti reservation nonsense, I will be ignoring you. \\n\\nNow that I\\'ve gotten that out of the way, lets talk.\\n\\nThe anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown, with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday. I didnt think it could be possible, but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack. \\n\\nAnd such it has been since day 1 i.e. the day the 2014 elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened, I\\'m forgetting where. The very day of the results. Modi hadnt even taken up PMship that day. \\n\\nSo to begin, Anti-Muslim rhetoric creates a unified Hindu identity. This is something that BJP has long worked for and was one of the goals of VHP, HM and RSS since their inception - create a Hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse. \\n\\nNow, I\\'m muslim. And I have no intention of blaming Dalits for the victory of BJP. Dalits, much like Muslims, have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular. Lalu\\'s first term & Maywati\\'s first full term withstanding, no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much. So yes, I do not blame these communities for voting outside their \\'champions\\', for \\'fracturing\\' the community vote. \\n\\nBut the fact remains that Modi\\'s government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called \"Congress + Cow\" it has been jokingly called \"Prakash Karat + Cow\". Such is the success of Modi\\'s socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.\\n\\nBut coming to the matter at hand, OBC representation in Parliament has been dropping and sarvana i.e. upper caste repesentation is increasing. Now, Dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease, but this seat reservation is working against them. I\\'m going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this\\n\\n[Not a single constituency in India has more than 50 per cent Dalit population, which means it’s always the non-Dalits who decide the fate of Dalit candidates in reserved constituencies. A vocal or assertive Dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats. To be re-elected, a Dalit MP must be careful not to antagonise the non-Dalits, and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in Parliament.](https://theprint.in/opinion/17th-lok-sabha-looks-set-to-confirm-ambedkars-fears-no-vocal-dalits-in-parliament/232383/)\\n\\nNote that Balasaheb knew this would happen. Which is why he proposed that non dalits not be given a vote on reserved seats. I am very much with him on this.\\n\\nSo who is the loser here? Mayawati has lost her base. There can be no doubt about it. The BSP+SP combine failed because SP votes were transfered to BSP but the BSP vote was not. Why? Because Dalits find BJP a more attractive proposition than BSP.  Who else? Lalu and Mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons. It is also less significant because OBC leaders are many. Dalit leaders are few. \\n\\nWhile Chandrashekar \\'Raavan\\' Azad has made a great big splash, he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day 1. He has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo. But he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible. \\n\\nUltimately even the news cycles focus on muslim, and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat, all the while forgetting that 85% of Indian Muslims are lower caste muslims. Here too, the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to Islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward caste.\\n\\nThis is all by design, mind you. The idea here is the same I mentioned earlier. Maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity. And its working.\\n\\nNote that Modi himself never speaks about caste. Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences. So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes.\\n\\nReading material:\\n\\n\\n[Why Dalits voted for the BJP](http://www.india-seminar.com/2019/720/720_snigdha_dhrubo_guru.htm)\\n[Despite having 40 Dalit MPs, why has the BJP ignored Dalit complaints?

I do not have any proof for or against this claim. I am not an expert and am only summarizing what I\\'ve been reading from multiple news sources to date.', \"I don't know if it is the same situation in other countries, but in India, I have seen A LOT of organisations which have very toxic environments.\\n\\nThere are offices where senior managers harass / shout at juniors, there are colleges where senior students rag juniors, there are school teachers who make fun of students who are not so good at studies and so on.\\n\\nIn many of the cases, I have seen that seniors harass juniors only because they were themselves harassed in the past by their own seniors. Many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too, when they were juniors. Do you see the problem here? - This cycle is never going to stop. One able person will harass another - this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuing.\\n\\nSo here is my request - BREAK THE CHAIN. Try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). Try not to vent out your frustration on your maid. When you shout on her, she may not reply you, but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration (perhaps she might shout at her kids). This will slowly start to have impact and I am hopeful people will get healthier work environments.

I would\\'ve blocked if it were any other person but I gave him benifit of doubt. Talked to him. We were having a productive discussion until the point he started justifying the actions taken by UP police and Delhi Police.

I am a grad student in the US(working towards my Ph.D), and most of friends here in the US are working in IT related jobs. What is worrying is that most of he these people got the jobs through consultants, who fake everything thing - from fake resumes to even fake phone interviews. I mean these are 22-23 YO with an experience of 8 years. I agree that the companies don\\'t care much about contracts jobs, but the people who work should have a sense of responsibility. 80% of my undergrad friends are working in this manner. Their defence is that \\'we spend so much money on education, it is only fair to earn and this is the easiest way we can earn good money.\"\\n\\nI never intrude into others\\' personal decisions, but this is really bothering me. We buy the newest Japanese and Germany cars in a flash, yet pirate songs and movies. We bitch about the state of politics, yet we behave the same way.. even worse in some cases that public servants.\\n\\nWe lack even the basic of ethics, we litter everywhere, drive like lunatics(we can\\'t even give way to ambulances) and are pretty inconsiderate of others overall. More than my disdain for politics, I am pretty annoyed by the behavior normal people.\\n\\nI am not saying that I am a perfect person, at least I am being honest to myself and even though I am being paid peanuts and under a lot of pressure from my parents, I am enjoying my student life. I am just sad that many people don\\'t have and share good values. \\n\\nThe Indian brain, is a phrase I have been hearing since I was a kid. Having been a PhD candidate, and seeing how India\\'s best and brightest compared to the world\\'s was an eye-opener for me. Sure my fellow Indians too won best paper awards and fellowships, but the average of originality & creativity was far higher in some of our Western counterparts.\\n\\nThe difference becomes even more stark, when one compares the contributions and achievements of Ashkenazi Jews (American or Israeli) to those of Indians. A persecuted minority of a few millions have contributed many orders more when compared to India\\'s privileged academic contributors- say Tamil Brahmins. Of course it is worse when compared to Indians as a whole. What is striking is that the difference holds true even when comparing in a different field like business/ finance and contrasting with Gujrati/ Marwaris.\\n\\nI am not exactly a self-hating Indian, and am moderately proud of Indian achievement when compared to some of our neighbors. But that is where it unfortunately ends.\\n\\nI recently moved southwards in the Bay Area- from Palo Alto/ Mountain View to Santa Clara/ San Jose. I dropped out of my PhD and now run a moderately successful startup with some burn rate, and wanted to save some dough as we are in the process of raising money. And my new residence[1] almost wants me to start hating Indians. The Indian food is far better here, but most Indians seem to be of the variety you describe- consultancy or menial tech jobs. They are clannish, semi-dumb and almost seem to be proud of their mediocrity. FML & I can\\'t wait to move to SF.\\n\\n[1] for those who are not aware, these areas are far more Indian populated. Though I have seen seen something similar when I visited a friend in New Jersey.\\n\\n\\nSocrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization\". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.\\n\\nIt is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‘Indian civilization’ with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it. Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say – “Indian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!”. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.\\n\\nThe most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all? Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, “How many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again. The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past. And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.\\n\\nIt is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.\\n\\nHow did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.\\n\\nEvery empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force. The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.\\n\\nThe strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‘Westernization’. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‘preserving Indian culture’, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.\\n\\n**A far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. “The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization”. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.**\\n\\nHistorical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.\\n\\nAnd so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.\\n\\n**TL;DR - We are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate. We also prefer shortcuts. It is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it.**', \"Was reading about Swaroop Sampat from Yeh jo hai Zindagi fame.

The NDRF and SRDFs are for \"*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”\\n\\nThe NDRMF and SDRMF are for *\"local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*\" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.\\n\\n*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.\\n\\n*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.\\n\\n*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨\\u200d⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs.

So credit to him for these parts.\\n\\n>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.\\n\\n>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).\\n\\n>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?\\n\\n>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it\\'s peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.\\n\\n>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!\\n\\nSo ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. \\nPersonally, i hope CPM just dies. \\n\\n\\n###Dilip Ghosh, BJP\\n\\nObviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP.

They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.\\n\\nShe took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.\\n\\nHer 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. \\n\\n>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.\\n\\n>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal\\'s economy? No, she hasn\\'t. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.\\n\\n>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.\\n\\n>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her \"Kanyashree\" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don\\'t talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There\\'s still loads of problems that need to be addressed.\\n\\n>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.\\n\\n>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!\\n\\nNOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)\\n\\nI actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM\\'s of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.\\n\\nAlso, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.\\n\\nAs such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.\\n\\n\\n###PS: What i left out.\\n\\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr \\n\\nIts called Syndicate.\\n\\nIn short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.\\n\\nAfter Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.\\n\\nJust before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]\\n\\nSame said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.\\n\\nIts very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.', 'Trying to build up my resume application for B schools!', \"  \\n\\n***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***\\n\\nWe never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. \\n\\nThis pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?\\n\\nBusinesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. \\n\\nRemarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. \\n\\nA critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**\\n\\nStudies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. \\n\\nReal Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.\\n\\n**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**\\n\\n1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.\\n\\n2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.\\n\\n3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   \\n (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.\\n\\n4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.\\n\\n5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.\\n\\nWhile the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: \\n\\n **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. \\n\\n**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.\\n\\n· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**\\n\\n· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.\\n\\n· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. \\n\\n· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.\\n\\n· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.\\n\\n· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own \\n\\n· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \\\\- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!\\n\\n· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \\\\- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \\\\- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!\\n\\n· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.\\n\\n· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.\\n\\n· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.\\n\\n· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.\\n\\n· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.\\n\\n**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**\\n\\nProbably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**\\n\\n1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.\\n\\n2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.\\n\\n3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.\\n\\n4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.\\n\\n5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.\\n\\n6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.\\n\\n7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** \\n\\n**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**\\n\\n\\\\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, \\n\\n\\\\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, \\n\\n\\\\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly \\n\\n\\\\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... \\n\\nSimply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process\\n\\n**The Bottom Line**\\n\\n**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**\\n\\nReal estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.\\n\\n**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**\\n\\nThoughts Compiled By : \\n\\nDheeraj Kochhar\\n\\nCapitor Ventures Pvt Ltd\\n\\nNavi Mumbai\\n\\nReferences : \\n\\nAnarock Report March 2020, Varsha Rathore, Zricks.com, Pic Credits: Google stories and newspapers\", 'Modi is on a killing spree. After killing poor people in DeMo, MSME in GST, now his latest target is Startups. Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. \\n\\nChina is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. [Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-4-billion-chinese-investment-desi-start-ups-wary-of-fdi-policy-tweak/articleshow/75228027.cms). Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. \\n\\n\\nAfter China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation\\'s free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. \\n\\n\\n\\nKey question to ask are:\\n\\n1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. \\n\\n2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It\\'s clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? \\n\\n3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?\\n\\n\\nMany Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy. Without any thought, the \"ban button\" has been pressed yet again. The same ban button that has become Modi\\'s favourite, for all situations.', \"This is going to be long. I would really appreciate it if you can read this fully. Thank you for your attention in advance. \\n\\nI'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.\\n\\n>About me & my partners\\n\\nI'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.\\n\\n>Our Business - What we do\\n\\nOur business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.\\n\\n>How has the lockdown affected my business?\\n\\nBeing a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.\\n\\nMe along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.\\n\\nThis worked smoothly with some hitches of course.\\n\\nIn January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.\\n\\nBut the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.\\n\\nOne thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.\\n\\nI had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.\\n\\nI wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.\\n\\nI'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.\\n\\n>The finances\\n\\nI'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.\\n\\n>What do I mean exactly? \\n\\nNow, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.\\n\\nI'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.\\n\\nI have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.\\n\\nBut I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.\\n\\nI come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.\\n\\nI'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.\\n\\nI'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.\\n\\nI'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this.\", 'Hey guys, I\\'m not sure if this is the correct subreddit to ask on, but it relates to India, and I couldn\\'t find a subreddit which was more appropriate. \\n\\nSo my question is how good is ISBF, Delhi?

Posting here for better visibility. \\n\\nSorry for a long post but I would really appreciate some career guidance.\\n\\nI'm gonna give you a brief background of my situation. I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Statistics, Mathematics and Economics (from Christ University Bangalore if it matters). During second year of college I really got into skateboarding and was desperately trying to make it work as a career option. I worked with Holystoked collective (they are the pioneers of skateboarding scene in India), built a skatepark in Bangalore with them and life was amazing. But towards the end of my undergrad I injured my knee pretty bad and things went downhill from there. One injury led to another and before I could realize, I had a knee issue, back pain, hip pain and what not. I was in poor health and it eventually took toll on my mental health. Long story short I pretty much wasted a little over one year. In 2017 I got my shit together and wrote the entrance test for writing actuarial exams. I started writing actuarial exams in 2018 and cleared 4 Core Technical exams by the end of 2019. I was going to write two more exams this April but our exams got cancelled due to COVID 19 pandemic.\\n\\nNow, I've been looking for an actuarial job for some time now and realized that its really really hard to get a job without contacts or college placements. I have also been learning data sciece and machine learning with python, as I already have a solid maths and statistics foundation, so as to get a data science or data analyst job and then perhaps switch to actuarial eventually. But now with an almost inevitable economic recession looming over our heads, I'm a little worried about my career.\\n\\nCould someone please guide me? Where do I go from here? Should I keep looking for jobs? Even if I do find a job I don't expect it to be more than 5LPA. Or should I go for higher education? Would an MBA in Finance or Business Analytics make sense?\", 'After this long lockdown due to COVID 19, you can certainly use some power-packed motivational speaker for your next employee convention, conference or event.\\n\\nThis is a quick and reliable list of the top 10 motivational speakers for your next conference or event in 2020.\\n\\n1.

He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  \\n\\nIssues:\\n\\nThere is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.\\nThey fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.\\nLives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.\\nWay ahead:\\n\\nOne way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. \\nThe ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. \\nThe cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.\\nOut-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. \\nThe government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).\\nIn the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.\\nLenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. \\nA credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. \\nSuch a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. \\nThe bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. \\nA GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.\\nThe loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. \\nSuch a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. \\n\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nThe crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.', ' \\n\\n### 1)\\xa0SARS-\\xadCoV-\\xad2\\xa0\\n\\n* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer\\xadreviewed, open\\xadaccess journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS\\xad-CoV-\\xad2, the virus causing the COVID-\\xad19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient\\n* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-\\xad2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID\\xad19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral \\xadfecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.\\n* As part of the research, samples \\xad including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes \\xad In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.\\n* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)\\n* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period\\n* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019\\xadnCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative\\n* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status\\n\\n#### About Coronaviruses\\n\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.\\xa0 In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.\\n\\n#### What is COVID-19?\\n\\nCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.\\n\\n#### About SARS\\n\\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19.

The Indian shooters have excelled in international competitions. Keeping this in mind, the Ministry of Home Affairs, vide its notification issued under the Arms Act 1959, has made provisions to provide adequate firearms and ammunition to the shooters for their practice. The Ministry of Home Affairs vides its notifications dated 12th February 2020 has amended the provisions of the Arms Act, 1959 and the Arms Rules, 2016 to increase the number of firearms that can be kept by the shooters and enhanced the quantity of ammunition fixed for their practice for the year. These provisions shall greatly facilitate their shooting practice.\\n* As per the new rules, now International Medalists/Renowned Shooters are allowed to keep additional weapons up to a total of twelve under the exempted category, which earlier was seven. If a shooter is renowned in one event, he can keep maximum eight (previously it was four), if a shooter is renowned in two events he can keep maximum ten (previously it was seven) and if a shooter is renowned in more than two events, he can keep maximum twelve (previously it was seven) firearms under exempted category. The junior target shooter/ aspiring shooter is now allowed to possess two weapons (previously one) of any category in which the person is a junior target shooter/aspiring shooter. This provision shall facilitate shooters in practicing with various types of firearms. Apart from the above exemptions, the shooters are entitled to possess two firearms as normal citizens under provisions of the Arms Act, 1959.\\n* Similarly, by amending the provision under Rule 40 of the Arms Rules, 2016 the quantity of ammunition that can be purchased by the shooters during the year for the practice has also been increased considerably. As per the new provisions, for .22 LR rifle/pistol 5000 instead of 1000, for another type of Pistol/Revolver 2000 instead of 600 and for shotgun calibers 5000 instead 500 can be purchased by the shooters.\\n* Apart from this, the Ministry of Home Affairs has also made other necessary amendments in the Arms Rules, 2016 by amending the Arms Act, 1959, vide the Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019. Through these amendments, it has also been clarified that no license is required for Indian citizens for acquisitions, possession of small arms falling under the category of curio.

He has saved 25L or so over the years to sustain for himself. \\n\\nHe has had thoughts for opening a playschool because he wanted to do something in education. Noble idea? Yes. But he does not have any background in education/teaching etc. and understanding how schools are run. More importantly, the problem is that my dad...unfortunately, lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people. \\n\\nHe tried to have a franchise with one company, signed a contract, and lost 1L there that the company refused to return. This was done without much consultation with me (where I could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it) Next, he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent 8L till date, running at a significant loss. \\n\\nI also have 2 elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else. We all are living in different cities (they in Mumbai, I am in Delhi, parents are in UP) My sister-in-law did step in as school coordinator initially but found a teaching gig (right step imo) elsewhere soonafter. Year to date, there are only 5 children with 2 teachers who mostly sit whole day. My dad acts as school coordinator. \\n\\n\\n**Current situation:**\\n\\nLately, he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out. (School is being run in a rented out building) He also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings, ignoring number of suggestions I made etc. To put cherry on the cake, I came across a profile of an experienced School coordinator which I suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was Muslim. (which wasn't something I expected of my dad...but that's another story)\\n\\nMy concern stems from the fact that this is a deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses. This is worrying for me because I have started job just 2 years back and expect it'd be at least 3-4 years before I am in a position where I can help him out a bit. Additionally, the current tenant has has are pretty good + it offers a recurring cashflow in terms of his savings.\\n\\nMy take on this is that if he wants to focus on education, why not simply open a scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids? While there is no upside to this financially, the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money IMO. \\n\\n\\n**TL:DR** Dad burning money in an educational venture. How do I stop this?\", '**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**\\n\\nCall me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.\\n\\nFascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).\\n\\nThis is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.\\n\\nThis is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.\\n\\nWhy abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.\\n\\n*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*\\n\\nOkay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”\\n\\nFrom our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.\\n\\nThe fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.\\n\\nWe fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.\\n\\nIf you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.\\n\\nAnd we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**\\n\\nReligious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?\\n\\nAn enemy.\\n\\nWhile the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370).

On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers “retaliated effectively”.\\n\\nFunnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji’s purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.\\n\\nAnd oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the \"white man\\'s burden\" if they\\'re white, and are inconsequential if they\\'re of any other colour.\\n\\nFascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final “good morning” on WhatsApp.\\n\\nIn Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‘rats’ (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans’ jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”\\n\\nThus they justified the Holocaust.\\n\\nJustifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.\\n\\nWe can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest.

If before GST this required one bill, it now means multiple bills depending on the number of states involved. It could go as high 36 bills (29 states + 7 union territories.) This means that if pre-GST X effort was required to make 100 rupees, it now requires n\\\\*X effort (1 to 36) to make 100 rupees. Meaning that the work required to make the same amount of money has increased by 100% to 3500% \\n\\nThis has impacted the profit of the companies and thus the economy. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBefore I begin, I am not an expert on taxation - I am a business guy working in B2B sales for an Indian MNC. My 3.5 year career has been largely post-GST, but I have experienced the pre-GST era as well. I constantly have to deal with GST and its numerous requirements.\\n\\nMy objective is to highlight a major roadblock that I and many other business folks have encountered due to GST, and I feel that this aspect is playing a big role in the slowdown and at the same time has been left largely unexplored till now because of the grassroot nature of the problem. The people higher up don't encounter this directly and anyone who doesn't encounter this wouldn't understand the gravity of the problem aka reporters, etc. Again to reiterate, I am not trying to debate the improvements over VAT and I am merely here to highlight a side of GST which is hindering my revenue and my profit, thus my business.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLet's start with some basic concepts first:\\n\\n/**1) Invoicing:** The act of giving a 'bill' for the products or services utilized by a customer. For most people, this is a simple receipt at the end of a meal for instance, or at the checkout counter of a clothing store for the clothes you've purchased, or a bill given by a cleaning service for cleaning their homes.\\n\\nBut for an organization, an invoice is the means to collect money from a client. Anything that is sold to a client will generate an invoice for the products delivered/services rendered. The invoice will also have the tax details (GST number, billing address, registered address, shipping address, list of items that need to be paid for, applicable tax - CGST, IGST, SGST, payment due date, and authorized signatures)\\n\\n**An invoice is a means to collect cash from the client. Without a proper invoice, cash cannot be collected. This is where the problem starts. Since not having a 'proper invoice' gives a lot of ground to the client to delay the payment.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n/**2) The process of Invoicing / Invoicing function in an organization:** Once the product is delivered or the services rendered, or sometimes before they are delivered, invoicing is triggered, meaning that a 'bill' is generated and the money has to be collected from the client. This is usually done through an ERP like SAP or Oracle. The invoice then reaches the collections department, where the collection manager submits the invoice to the client for verification and payment. **The collection managers are the front line people tasked with bringing money into the organization.** They are one of the most important people for running the business because their performance impacts the cash flow of the organization.\\n\\nThey are normally tagged to accounts, aka clients. One collection manager could be handling anywhere from one client to thousands, depending on the nature and size of their clients.\\n\\n**Once the client verifies the invoice, the money is transferred to the selling organization and it becomes revenue and subsequently profit for them.**\\n\\n**If the client holds the invoice for any reason, then it becomes lost revenue or a bad debt (loss) for the selling organization.** The longer the client holds this money, the lesser the value that money holds due to the concept of time-value of money. 100 rupees today is considered as more money than 100 rupees one month from now due to the time-value of money. Thus a delayed payment impacts the profitability of the organization.\\n\\n**/3) GST for the services industry:** GST dictates that the invoicing for services will be done in the state where the services have been delivered. **I will explain this concept in detail as this is the crux of the problem.** To start off, I will outline a simple sale and how that sale would translate into the pre-GST and post-GST era:\\n\\n**Problem Statement:** Assume that Tata Motors intend to buy 5000 chairs for their offices from Pepperfry for 50 lakh rupees. Tata Motors also wants Pepperfry to install the chairs in their offices (5 lakh rupees), and then provide 5 years warranty including a checkup every year to determine the life of the chair, and any repairs required (15 lakh rupees.) Tata Motors wants the chairs to be delivered to 50 offices in india, across 20 different states. This is a mix of products (chairs) & services (installation and maintenance.) The total bill is for 70 lakh rupees -\\n\\n5000 Chairs - INR 50 Lakhs\\n\\nInstallation of Chairs in 50 Offices across 20 states - INR 5 Lakhs\\n\\nMaintenance of Chairs for 5 years - INR 15 Lakhs\\n\\nPepperfry sales executives will take the purchase order from Tata Motors and put the order into their system. The input of the purcahse order will trigger three functions:\\n\\na) Delivery of the products & services\\n\\nb) Invoicing and payment for the order\\n\\nc) Post-Sale service & maintenance\\n\\n**Pre-GST Invoicing:**\\n\\nBefore GST came into the picture, the above bill would be generated by Pepperfry as a single bill centrally ie they would generate a bill for 70 lakhs, with the extra relevant VAT and the tax details of the two organizations. This would be on **ONE SINGLE BILL** for the entire deal, irrespective of state, city, etc. They would just give Tata Motors one single piece of paper saying that they are owed 70 lakhs with the due date for the payment.\\n\\nManoj who is Pepperfrys collection manager for Tata Motors will submit this single invoice at the Tata Motors office where it will be checked by the Tata Motors procurement and finance teams, and if there is nothing wrong with the invoice, the payment will be cleared off by the due date.\\n\\n**Again the point to focus on here is that only ONE INVOICE is needed for the delivery of the chairs and services to the entire country. Manoj has to submit just one invoice, follow up on invoice, and collect the payment on one invoice. Tata Motors teams have to verify one invoice, and process the payment on one invoice. Only one tax number and billing address is needed on the invoice because it is being done CENTRALLY.**\\n\\nIf there is something wrong with the invoice, Manoj has to correct only one invoice and resubmit it to Tata Motors.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Post-GST Invoicing:**\\n\\nLike I mentioned before, GST dictates that the invoicing be done in the state where the services have been delivered ie separate GST filing for all states. Explaining further this means that a separate invoice has to be generated for each state that is involved in the transaction. If this one state involved, one invoice. If two states are involved, then two invoices. If five states are involved, then five invoices. And in this case since twenty states are involved, twenty invoices.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe values of the invoices are split in direct proportion to the usage. If 100 rs is the total bill value, in three states, Maharashtra, UP & Kerala with 60:30:10 usage, then the bills will be:\\n\\nMaharashtra - 60\\n\\nUP - 30\\n\\nKerala - 10\\n\\nSo in a sense it is a separate company in each state in terms of GST.\\n\\n**Moving on to the implication in the Tata Motors - Pepperfry transaction:**\\n\\nSince the chairs have to be delivered in 20 states, Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state. Tata Motors will have to issue 20 purchase orders in the proportionate value to Pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally into 20 states. The sales executive will enter twenty purchase orders into the system. Then deliveries will be triggered for 20 states and 20 different invoices will be handed over to Manoj after generation.\\n\\nManoj will submit 20 invoices to Pepperfry, whose procurement department will then verify 20 invoices, give it to finance to verify and then initiate 20 payments. Then 20 payments will be received by Tata Motors (with 20 banking transaction ID's) and Manoj will verify the 20 payments and close the transaction for now. ***This is the ideal scenario.***\\n\\nAs you might have been able to tell, the effort required by everyone involved in the deal has gone up 20 times. This effort required will be the same as before if there is only one state involved on the buying side, ie Maharastra selling to Maharashtra. It'll be twice the effort if two states are involved on the buying side, ie Maharashtra selling to UP & Kerala. **It has a possibility of going upto 36 time the effort required previously for the same amount of money since there are 29 states and 7 Union Territories. Yes Union Territories are treated separately as well.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**The impact from this is:**\\n\\n**/1) Efficiency/Effort:** Pepperfry is still going to make 70 lakhs on the deal but the effort required will be twenty times that of before because Tata Motors will give 20 purchase orders on which 20 invoices will be generated. The time taken to process these invoices is the same because their value does not impact the time taken to collect the money on them. This is because each invoice will be the same template, its just that their  values will be different. Example:\\n\\nMaharashtra\\n\\nChairs - INR 5 Lakhs\\n\\nInstallation - INR 50K\\n\\nSupport - INR 1.5 Lakhs\\n\\nKerala\\n\\nChairs - INR 3 Lakhs\\n\\nInstallation - INR 30K\\n\\nSupport - INR 90K\\n\\nUP\\n\\nChairs - INR 10 Lakhs\\n\\nInstallation - INR 1 Lakh\\n\\nSupport - INR 3 Lakhs\\n\\nThe total money being collected is the same as before but the sales executive, Manoj, the procurement guy & the finance guy have to do 20 times the work for it with no other added value.\\n\\nTheir efficiency in this scenario has gone down to 5% but it can arguably go down to 2.7% if all states and union territories are involved, although this is a rare case.\\n\\nAlso like I said that this is the ideal scenario. It doesn't always go this smoothly. Some of the challenges encountered are:\\n\\na) Incorrect proportions of purchase orders / invoices: Someone made a mistake if 10 needed to be allocated to UP, then they've allocated 11 or 15. The process has to be repeated again after finding the fault.\\n\\nb) Incorrect GST on PO / invoice: Suppose a particular invoice has the wrong GST, it means that it can't be processed on incorrect tax information, which means that that money can't be collected on that invoice. Before GST there would be one wrong tax number, now it could be one or two or twenty. Mistakes happen in the real life. This is one of the most common things we face. Mistakes happened before GST as well, now they just happen in multiples. And we really can't expect people to make mistakes because they always will. Again efficiency goes down as multiple times the effort is required to fix the mistakes.\\n\\nc) Missing GST: It isn't necessary that all companies will have a GST registration in every state. So Tata Motors might not have a registered office in 2 states for example ie they won't have a GST number. They will now have to provide a declaration to Pepperfry saying that they don't have a GST number for two states, and then Pepperfry will be able to give them the invoice. The payment of the money is delayed till then. Getting that declaration in my experience takes a long time because if Tata Motors says that, they aren't able to claim input tax credit in that state. That's like leaving money on the table for them - and getting this declaration basically saying that they are willing to lose money on the transaction, requires approvals upto the highest levels because it is a loss to the company. Manoj now has to follow up on two more time consuming things to get the same amount of money and thus efficiency goes down further.\\n\\n**/2) Cash Flow:** Cash is the lifeline of a company. A company without cash cannot survive. They could be valued at a billion dollars but if they don't have cash to pay their employees, they will shut down. Kingfisher couldn't pay their employees, interest, vendors because they didn't have cash left, same for Jet - again doesn't have cash for payment of salaries, fuel, loan payments, etc. BSNL again is struggling to pay for things because they don't have cash.\\n\\nThus a healthy cash flow is one of the most important aspects of the business or for the survival of the company. If companies were people, cash flow would be the oxygen. Invoicing is how cash is brought into the company.\\n\\nBecause of the decrease in efficiency of the collection managers, a delay is introduced in the collection of the cash. So if pre-GST cash was being collected in 25 days, now it would be taking say 45 days because the collection managers efficiency has gone down.\\n\\nAnd the tiny delays add up. Incorrect GST - add another 7 days for that cash to be collected, missing GST - add 15 days, etc.\\n\\nThis has two outcomes:\\n\\nFirstly, because Pepperfry had earlier predicted that they'll get the money in 30 days but they are now receiving it in 45 days, that means the 70 lakhs they need at the 30th day for their daily expenses now needs to be found from somewhere else since this 70 days will now be coming after another 2 weeks. They will have to dip into the reserves for 15 days.\\n\\nSecondly, the money has lost some value. It was 70 lakhs at the end of 30 days but now since time has passed, it has lost some value due to the time value of money. It could've generated interest or it could've been invested but now this is delayed and hence some value is lost. This is a loss to Pepperfry.\\n\\nTo summarize, **GST has delayed the payment cycle of the company. It now takes longer to collect the same amount of money than it used to before GST was introduced. If money takes longer to come in, it takes longer to go out - salaries, interest payments, vendor payments, and other outflows are impacted.**\\n\\n**/3 Profit:** The profit made on a deal varies from company to company and deal to deal. Let us assume that Pepperfry made 10% profit on this deal ie 7 lakhs. Due to the following factors this profit will get impacted:\\n\\na) The payment cycle is delayed so they're collecting the profit after a longer duration. They will have to collect 63 lakhs before they start making a profit. This could be after say they've collected 13 of the 20 invoices. The remaining 7 will give them their profit. So basically profit generation is delayed because the cash flow has been delayed. This means that the profit made on the deal has lost some value. If pre-GST this was 7 lakhs, now it'll be less than 7 lakhs in value due to the time value of money. And again because efficiency has gone down, the effort required to generate the same amount of profit has gone up, and thus the profit on the deal has actually gone down.\\n\\nb) There are 20 invoices to process. Not all will always go through. Many will get stuck and the payment will be delayed or may never come due to the process issues. The money that will just linger there and never come to Pepperfry will become a bad debt to them. If the invoice gets stuck for some reason like incorrect GST, missing GST, incorrect value, the cash won't be collected for that invoice and that amount will get reduced from the profit. So because the invoice hasn't gotten processed, the 7 lakhs profit will now be less say 5 lakhs. If more than 7 lakhs is not collected on the deal, then Pepperfry will actually make a loss on the deal.\\n\\nThe biggest culprits of this are PSU's like HPCL, BPCL, UBI, etc. Their requirements are so stringent that if there is a single mistake and they hold the invoice. This payment could get delayed for years and thus the profit on the deal is impacted. They just won't pay till everything on the invoice is correct or they could delay for multiple other reasons. Many businesses don't sell to PSU's because of this reason - their profits and cash get stuck in doing business with them.\\n\\nThis is different from pre-GST because earlier if say there was a mistake, there was one invoice to fix. Now there could be many. For the same amount of revenue as before, now chances are you won't make the same amount of profit.\\n\\n**Thus due to the lowered efficiency, longer payment cycle and stuck payments, the profit made has gotten impacted.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn conclusion to my ramblings, due to the state-specific nature of GST, the effort required to make the same amount of money as the pre-GST era has gone up. This has impacted the revenue and thus the profit made by companies and these are problems that everyone will face because of how GST is. If you want to do business in multiple states, you will have to be ready to face these challenges.\\n\\nFeel free to discuss the impact this will have on our economy. In my opinion it has had a big impact but I really need someone much more knowledgeable than me to analyze and publish that. I feel this deserves a conversation at the very least because this one change has impacted revenue and profit extensively, it has made making money harder and thus is going to have a lasting impact on the economy. The worst part is it doesn't look like this system is going to change in the near future.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI'll probably put a tl;dr later.\", 'https://preview.redd.it/f7scwd5qfxb41.jpg?width=1549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de8994dc03fea1d02c1012fe69a1c27fa18ecd59\\n\\nEver since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation\\'s education system.  \\nApart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana\\'s I honestly don\\'t think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country.

Yet, our philosophies of governance have not evolved. Our constitutions are old, and our leaders are too far gone. We need to come up with new ways - starting from scratch - to govern ourselves if we want to take the next step to human evolution.', '', 'EDIT > My bad.

[English]\", 'India has followed China in its wish to embrace the blockchain technology. The India Times reported on Nov. 27, 2019, that India\\'s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to embrace blockchain technology adopting a national strategy.\\n\\nThe minister of state for electronics and information technology Sanjay Dhotre said a few weeks ago:\\n\\n>Considering the potential of Blockchain Technology and the need for shared infrastructure for different use cases, an approach paper on National Level Blockchain Framework is being prepared.\\\\[...\\\\] Blockchain Technology as one of the important research areas having application potential in different domains such as Governance, Banking and Finance, Cyber Security, and so on.\\n\\nBesides, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported a blockchain project \"Distributed Centre of Excellence in Blockchain Technology.\" Blockchain-based \"Proof of Existence (PoE)\" framework is being developed for different uses (authenticating academic certificates, sale deeds, and other documents) by the ministry. Dhotre added:\\n\\n>By using the PoE framework, \\\\[a\\\\] solution is developed to authenticate academic certificates. Blockchain technology has also been used, and PoC \\\\[proof-of-concept\\\\] is developed for vehicle life cycle management and hotel registry management.\\n\\nIndia is developing a property registration based on the blockchain, which is being piloted in Telangana state. Other blockchain use-cases are focused on cloud security, trade finance, and central KYC.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that India has been experimenting with blockchain since 2017. According to Deloitte\\'s research conducted in April 2017, Indian players tried to implement blockchain in such spheres as trade finance, supply chain financing, e-KYC document management, cross-border payments, and others.\\n\\nThough India seems to be \"pro-blockchain,\" it is still negative on crypto. On July 16, 2019, India proposed a draft bill banning trading and using cryptocurrencies. To separate cryptocurrency from digital rupee and digital foreign currencies (which are backed by Central banks), the government has given a definition of crypto in the draft bill:\\n\\n>Any information or code or number or token not being part of any official digital currency, generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value which is exchange with or without consideration, with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity which may involve risk of loss or an expectation of profits or income, or functions as a store of value or a unit of account and includes its use in any financial transaction or investment, but not limited to, investment schemes.\\n\\nApart from that, the report has named several reasons to ban crypto and impose fines and penalties for conducting any activities connected with it in India.\\n\\n1. Crypto is created by non-sovereigns and serves as a private enterprise in this sense.\\n2. Crypto has no underlying intrinsic value and lacks all the characteristics of a currency.\\n3. Crypto has no fixed nominal value, so it neither acts as a store of value nor as a medium of exchange.\\n4. Crypto is extremely volatile.\\n5. Crypto cannot serve the purpose of a currency as it is \"inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency\", so it cannot replace fiat.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/il7amik7bm341.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d0f2a43789170e28a1c769fdecc450598de04cf', '', '\\n\\nLooks like Lakshmi Vilas Bank is going down.\\n\\nIf you have an account there transfer online today or take out the cash tomorrow before they put a restriction of 1000 per month like PMC bank.\\n\\n\\nEconomic Offences Wing registers FIR against Lakshmi Vilas Bank for offences of cheating, criminal breach of trust by banker, criminal conspiracy & misappropriation.

I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* \\n\\nLast week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.\\n\\n1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***\"There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods\".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***\"I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them\".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***\"Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart\"***\\n2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend\\'s relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***\"Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.\"***\\n3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***\"Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early\"***\\n4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***\"There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.\"*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop. He said , ***\"No one is going out of the village even to sell. Last week 3 autos drivers had sold their autos and moved into other businesses.\"***\\n\\n**My personal inference**: A lot bad is going. The news channels are not showing anything. The ones that do show about this, are yet very far away from the ground realities. I am just wondering about farm labours who have no source of income except daily wage. The news channels and people bragging about Hindi-Muslim debate are either paid or brainwashed. At the ground, there are many structural problems. Sadly many of them think it is their fate rather than the failure of governments.', '', \"I have got an interview call letter from IIM Lucknow for FPM(Fellowship programme in management).

On top of it Air India\\'s bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.\\n\\nThe Virus isn\\'t something that would have wrecked the economy itself it\\'s something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.\\n\\nWe will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it\\'s based on perceptions. You haven\\'t actually lost the money as long as you don\\'t book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That\\'s why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.\\n\\nIf a share falls by 30% that doesn\\'t mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it\"s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.\\n\\nIt\\'s sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn\\'t matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It\\'s ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. \\n\\nRight now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don\\'t forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.', '', '###Adhir Chowdhury, Congress\\n\\n\\nI actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom\\'s side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]\\nAfter losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. \\nSince 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.\\n\\n\\n###Surja Kanta Mishra, CPM\\n\\nA Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. \\n\\nNow i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.\\n\\n>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.\\n\\n>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).\\n\\n>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?\\n\\n>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it\\'s peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.\\n\\n>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!\\n\\nSo ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. \\nPersonally, i hope CPM just dies. \\n\\n\\n###Dilip Ghosh, BJP\\n\\nObviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP.

They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.\\n\\nShe took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.\\n\\nHer 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. \\n\\n>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.\\n\\n>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal\\'s economy? No, she hasn\\'t. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.\\n\\n>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.\\n\\n>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her \"Kanyashree\" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don\\'t talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There\\'s still loads of problems that need to be addressed.\\n\\n>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.\\n\\n>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!\\n\\nNOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)\\n\\nI actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM\\'s of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.\\n\\nAlso, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi.

They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.\\n\\nAfter Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.\\n\\nJust before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]\\n\\nSame said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.\\n\\nIts very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.', 'An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person\\'s entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I\\'m reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes\\n\\n1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:\\n * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.\\n * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.\\n\\n2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:\\n * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).\\n * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.\\n * \\'Exit\\', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions\\n\\n3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.\\n\\n4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period \"post-liberalisation\" for each economy:\\n * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|\\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\\nKorea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|\\nBGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|\\nThailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|\\nIndonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|\\nMalaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|\\nChina|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|\\nVietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|\\nIndia|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|\\n\\n5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:\\n * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.\\n * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.\\n\\n * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India\\'s domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India\\'s share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)\\n\\n * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.\\n\\n**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I\\'ll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction.

In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018.

Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market.

The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))\\n* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))\\n* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo.

The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))\\n* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue.

They suffered significantly. Delay in wage payments, drop in incomes and loss of employment disproportionately affected the poor due to their reliance on cash. (Source - [Hitting the bottom](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/hitting-the-bottom/article9992462.ece))\\n* Unemplyment soared significantly to 45-year high of 6.1 percent between July 2017 and June 2018. It is estimated that 33 lakh people permanently lost their source of employment.(Source - [Life after Demonetisation: How India's poor are still paying the price](https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/life-demonetisation-india-poor-paying-price-190614135641262.html))\\n* It directly/indirectly led to death of around 100 Indians. (Source - [Indian Banknote Demonetisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation)).\\n\\nA couple more points I'd like to add:\\n\\n* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.\\n* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.\\n\\nSumming up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post. Thanks for reading.Please let me know if I missed anything and I'd be happy to update my post.\", \"  \\n\\n***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***\\n\\nWe never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. \\n\\nThis pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?\\n\\nBusinesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. \\n\\nRemarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. \\n\\nA critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**\\n\\nStudies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. \\n\\nReal Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.\\n\\n**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**\\n\\n1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.\\n\\n2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.\\n\\n3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   \\n (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.\\n\\n4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.\\n\\n5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.\\n\\nWhile the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: \\n\\n **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. \\n\\n**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.\\n\\n· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**\\n\\n· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.\\n\\n· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. \\n\\n· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.\\n\\n· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.\\n\\n· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own \\n\\n· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \\\\- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!\\n\\n· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \\\\- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \\\\- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!\\n\\n· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.\\n\\n· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.\\n\\n· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.\\n\\n· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.\\n\\n· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.\\n\\n**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**\\n\\nProbably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**\\n\\n1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.\\n\\n2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.\\n\\n3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.\\n\\n4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.\\n\\n5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.\\n\\n6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.\\n\\n7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** \\n\\n**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**\\n\\n\\\\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, \\n\\n\\\\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, \\n\\n\\\\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly \\n\\n\\\\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... \\n\\nSimply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process\\n\\n**The Bottom Line**\\n\\n**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**\\n\\nReal estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.\\n\\n**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**\\n\\nThoughts Compiled By : \\n\\nDheeraj Kochhar\\n\\nCapitor Ventures Pvt Ltd\\n\\nNavi Mumbai\\n\\nReferences : \\n\\nAnarock Report March 2020, Varsha Rathore, Zricks.com, Pic Credits: Google stories and newspapers\", 'Modi is on a killing spree. After killing poor people in DeMo, MSME in GST, now his latest target is Startups. Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. \\n\\nChina is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. [Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-4-billion-chinese-investment-desi-start-ups-wary-of-fdi-policy-tweak/articleshow/75228027.cms). Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. \\n\\n\\nAfter China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation\\'s free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. \\n\\n\\n\\nKey question to ask are:\\n\\n1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. \\n\\n2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It\\'s clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? \\n\\n3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?\\n\\n\\nMany Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy. Without any thought, the \"ban button\" has been pressed yet again. The same ban button that has become Modi\\'s favourite, for all situations.', '', 'One of India\\'s Election Commissioners, Ashok Lavasa, in a brilliant [recent ](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-difficulty-of-being-honest-prevention-of-corruption-act-ashok-lavasa-election-commission-of-india-6188078/)article  wrote,\"People are generally good; they are also generally timid\". And I think it defines our middle classes perfectly.\\n\\nIndia has always had an aspirational middle class. This middle class is largely moderate, driven by ambitions of economic prosperity and social stability (just like the middle classes of any other country). They want to be socially and economically upwardly mobile, resent overtly divisive policies with uncertain ends and are busy in their lives (thus the timidity).\\n\\nNow, the point of a democratic society is democratic changes (a.k.a gradual changes). There\\'s a reason we\\'re regarded as elephants and China\\'s as a dragon. We praise China for what they\\'ve done with their economy but hold dear what we have i.e our voice.\\n\\nModi Govt seems to be constantly stirring the pot with radical policies. This has started affecting the lives of a common Indian more than ever, and negatively too. Modi supporter or not, demonetisation, for example, in hindsight, is uniformly chided for being wasteful and avoidable.\\n\\nMiddle and lower middle classes will now increasingly start disassociating with what this govt stands for. The CAA crackdown, kashmir situation but most importantly the incompetent handling of the economy will soon have them looking for viable alternatives. A BJP, which for the longest time stood for economic liberalisation, corruption-free politics, efficient governance - atleast in the minds of the educated - now stands exposed with its vitriolic campaigns and its ineptitude to handle nuanced issues like the Kashmir problem. \\n\\nI see a political vacuum forming soon, and a desperate search for alternatives by the upwardly mobile middle and lower middle classes and an opportunity for something new.', '**Videos and Images** \\n\\nLakhs of migrant labourers have been left stranded.

A proper plan could and would have prevented this. A proper stimulus package planned in advance, and not one quickly put together in reaction to this, should have been there.

Can you imagine, how these men, women, and children are supposed to *walk* hundreds of kilometers in absence of public transport? It\\'s beyond cruel what the Centre has compelled these already oppressed groups of people to do right now. These migrant workers will also (many already are) face the brutality of lathi-happy cops. With state borders locked, they will essentially remain nomads, unless proper arrangements are made for them.  And, worst of all, these migrant workers, who don\\'t have the luxury to wash hands for twenty seconds with soaps (can\\'t afford soaps, can\\'t afford to waste what little water they have), how are they supposed to remain safe from the pandemic? It\\'s also equally likely that they make take the coronavirus along with them to their villages. And let\\'s not forget that rural public healthcare is already in shambles. Those rushing to fellate the prime minister for his \"brave\" and \"strong\" step do not fucking understand how this lockdown has already disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

Phillips was one of the first economists to present compelling evidence of the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation. Phillips studied the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages in the United Kingdom over a period of almost a full century (1861-1957), and he\\xa0discovered that the latter could be explained by (a) the level of unemployment\\xa0and (b) the rate of change of unemployment.\\n\\n>Phillips hypothesized that when demand for labor is high\\xa0and there are few unemployed workers, employers can be expected to bid wages up quite rapidly. However, when demand for labor is low,\\xa0and unemployment is high, workers are reluctant to accept lower wages than the prevailing rate, and as a result, wage rates fall very slowly.\\n\\n>A\\xa0second factor that affects wage rate changes is the rate of change in unemployment. If business is booming, employers will bid more vigorously for workers, which means that demand for labor is increasing at a fast\\xa0pace (i.e., percentage unemployment is decreasing rapidly), than they would if the demand for labor were either not increasing (e.g., percentage unemployment is unchanging) or only increasing at a slow pace.\\n\\nDoes this mean the current government's quest for low inflation is indirectly leading to unemployment going up .\\n\\nLow inflation means companies and investors have no initiative to invest . However during times of inflation , investors look for places to invest their money in since it will keep on losing its  value if it kept ideal .\\n\\nDuring Congress years of 2004-2014 , high inflation also most probably lead to increased consumer spending and expenditure. Since a large sector of Indian economy is dependent on internal consumption , it experienced significant growth due to it \\n\\n\\nThe reserve bank of India has been also extremely focused on fighting inflation . Many people are saying that this obsession with inflation is causing them to keep interest rates too high , as a result of which private companies have no initiative to borrow loans for new ventures\\n\\n\\n>As these examples of hyperinflation show, states have a powerful incentive to keep price rises in check. For the past century in the U.S., the approach has been to manage inflation using\\xa0monetary policy. To do so, the\\xa0Federal Reserve\\xa0(the U.S.\\xa0central bank)\\xa0relies\\xa0on the relationship between\\xa0inflation and interest rates. If\\xa0interest rates\\xa0are low, companies and individuals can borrow cheaply to start a business, earn a degree, hire new workers, or buy a shiny new boat. In other words, low rates encourage spending and investing, which generally stoke inflation in turn.By raising interest rates, central banks can put a damper on these rampaging\\xa0animal spirits\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/is-low-inflation-the-culprit-for-indias-economic-woes/articleshow/71190710.cms\", 'It can be any research center publishing original research relating to different facets of Indian economy and polity.  \\nSome which I have found reasonably good are [Center on Indian Economic Policies, Columbia University] (https://indianeconomy.columbia.edu/), [South Asia Center, LSE](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/southasia/), [Carnegie India](http://carnegieindia.org/) and [Centre for Public Policy, IIM Bangalore](http://www.iimb.ac.in/node/5492)', 'IMPORTANT: The following events are organized by at least **10 Central Trade Unions under the Trade Union Coordination** Committee against Anti-worker policies of the current Govt.

He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  \\n\\nIssues:\\n\\nThere is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.\\nThey fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.\\nLives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.\\nWay ahead:\\n\\nOne way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. \\nThe ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. \\nThe cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.\\nOut-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. \\nThe government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).\\nIn the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.\\nLenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. \\nA credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. \\nSuch a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. \\nThe bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. \\nA GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.\\nThe loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. \\nSuch a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. \\n\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nThe crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.', ' \\n\\n### 1)\\xa0SARS-\\xadCoV-\\xad2\\xa0\\n\\n* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer\\xadreviewed, open\\xadaccess journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS\\xad-CoV-\\xad2, the virus causing the COVID-\\xad19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient\\n* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-\\xad2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID\\xad19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral \\xadfecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.\\n* As part of the research, samples \\xad including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes \\xad In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.\\n* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)\\n* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period\\n* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019\\xadnCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative\\n* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status\\n\\n#### About Coronaviruses\\n\\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.\\xa0 In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.\\n\\n#### What is COVID-19?\\n\\nCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.\\n\\n#### About SARS\\n\\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.\\n\\nSource: The Hindu\\xa0\\n\\n### 2)\\xa0G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia\\n\\n* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).\\n* It was presided by Saudi Arabia.

It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.\\n   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.\\n* What is the structure right now?\\n   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.\\n   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.\\n   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.\\n   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.\\n* Need for joint commands?\\n   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.\\n* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?\\n   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India.

After killing poor people in DeMo, MSME in GST, now his latest target is Startups. Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. \\n\\nChina is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups. Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. \\n\\n\\nAfter China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation\\'s free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. \\n\\n\\n\\nKey question to ask are:\\n\\n1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. \\n\\n2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It\\'s clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli-maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? \\n\\n3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?\\n\\n\\nMany Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy. Without any thought, the \"ban button\" has been pressed yet again. The same ban button that has become Modi\\'s favourite, for all situations.', '', \"What the fuck is modi doing ?

An FIR has been filed against the Maulana & others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the Court will determine whether they\\'ve violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly.  \\n\\n\\nLet\\'s look at certain facts pertaining to the situation.  \\n\\n\\n1. Firstly, this was a 3-day religious gathering, between [March 13-15](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696).  \\nAnd this was much before the lockdown in Delhi (from March 23) & the Nationwide lockdown (from March 25).\\n2. The Delhi Government has alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat\\'s 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their [Order dated 13.03.2020](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696), which prohibits *\"all sports gathering (including IPL)/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people\".*   \\n\\\\-  Note that this Order was issued on March 13, the very same day that the event had already    begun, implying that the attendees were already in Delhi by the time the Delhi Govt issued the order.    \\n\\\\-  Courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order *\"all sports gathering/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people\"* will cover this 3-day religious congregation.  \\n\\\\-  [The FIR](https://twitter.com/DelhiPolice/status/1244983752314564608) filed also alleges criminal conspiracy, which will also have to be investigated and proved before the Court. \\n3. So essentially, the legal process has been initiated against them. And if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question, they will be punished.  \\nIn this light, holding a media trial is uncalled for. We don\\'t even have all the facts in the public domain.   \\nFor instance, the [Delhi Govt itself blames the police](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696) for not having enforced its March 13 Order, given that the Nizamuddin Police Station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place.\\n4. Further, a quick look at the general mood of the country as on March 13, points to the fact that concepts such as \"social distancing\" & \"self-quarantining\" weren\\'t popularised by the Governments to the extent that we see today.   \\nFor instance, as on March 13, the number of cases we had was 81, as opposed to the 2000 cases today, and addressing reporters, Health Ministry Joint Secretary had said on March 13 itself, that [coronavirus is not a health emergency & there is no need to panic.](https://theprint.in/health/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-81-in-india-govt-says-covid-19-not-a-health-emergency/380819/) \\n5. A number of events took place between March 13 and March 22 ( Janata Curfew), followed by the Lockdown, involving huge numbers of people - religious places of worship with thousands of devotees, political events including toppling a certain state government, etc.  \\n\\n\\nWhile legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good. In fact, it alienates the Muslim community even more & spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible & criminal in itself.', '', ' \\n\\nDepartment: Directorate of Youth Services and Sports Himachal Pradesh \\n\\nDeadline: 7th January, 2020 (Source: The Tribune)\\n\\nContact id: deputydirectoryss@gmail.com \\n\\nDocument: \\n\\n[Draft of Himachal Pradesh State Sports Policy, 2020](https://ourgovdotin.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/1576923249.pdf)', '', '[Google Maps Link](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1_bM1sTJc2Tm3f6B9wdaq9GfJQ2kHJp2P)\\n\\n[Health Ministry PDF](https://icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/upload_documents/Testing_sites_for_COVID19.pdf)\\n\\n[Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ER2-h-kL-DXFjbegEtu9e1opDY9H0hiAOjbEHJDdm6M/edit?usp=sharing)\\n\\n*Tips:*\\n\\n1.

He is an independent researcher who has been documenting the Aadhaar project along with several other researchers. His work made him file public interest litigation against the illegal voter deletions by ECI using Aadhaar and NPR data.\\n\\nOn our request, he sent us the following text explaining the significance of NPR.\\n\\n> The national population register is a very old project whose pilot implementation dates back to 1986 in rural rajasthan. The project came into the mainstream after the kargil war of 1999 when India realised it can't identify the foreigners from indians. During a conference of chief ministers on internal security in 2001, the project was approved. Part of the project every indian was supposed to be distributed Multi Purpose National Identity Cards, which were essentially smart card with fingerprints stored in chip. While this project was being piloted, India went through another attack on 26/11/08 in Mumbai by pakistani terrorists posing as fishermen.  This is the first time cards were started being distributed to fishermen and so on. \\n\\n> But post 26/11, due to the heavy intelligence failures multiple other databases like NATGRID, CCTNS, CMS, Aadhaar poppped up. Aadhaar project and NPR were very similar. So to deal with it, the cabinet combined both of them, the registar general of india became a registrar under UIDAI and started distributing Aadhaar. The deal was NPR will get biometrics from UIDAI post de-duplication, but the supreme court stopped all of this by ordering no biometrics will be shared with anyone. \\n\\n> After all of this, NPR project continued and was updated part of 2011 census and again in 2015. The project in itself is the start of National Register of Citizens. NPR data will be used to disclose a list of citizens and the ones not in it will be classified as foreign residents.\\n\\nHis Twitter: https://twitter.com/digitaldutta\\n\\nRecently he published an article on NRC-NPR-Aadhaar nexus on thewire.in.

Aatish will be with us to answer questions and share his opinions on politics, the ongoing citizenship protests in India among other things. \\n\\nIn case you are not familiar with his work please find some details below:\\n\\n> Taseer was born in London to politician and businessman Salman Taseer (who was born in British India to a British mother and Indian father, the latter became Pakistani at partition) and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh. His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan\\n\\n> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.\\n> He is the author, most recently, of “The Way Things Were,” which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as “the best Indian novel of the last decade.”\\n> His other books are “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” a Costa-shortlisted first novel, “The Temple-Goers,” and the highly acclaimed “Noon.” He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.\\n\\n> On 8 November 2019, Taseer\\'s Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to \"conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin\". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn\\'t give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled \"India’s divider in chief\" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer\\'s citizenship.\\n\\n> Taseer\\'s first book Stranger to History: A Son\\'s Journey Through Islamic Lands (2009), His part memoir-part travelogue, has been translated into more than 14 languages and hailed as a \"must-read\" for anyone attempting to understand the Muslim world.

One opened near where I lived at the time. I was an engineering student at a decent Bombay college and before the semester exams, I’d be studying at home. My mom would force me to mop the floors and do the dishes. Youth makes most rebel against order and I did too. I told my mom that I’d rather mop the floors at the nearby McDonald’s branch and be paid rather than do the same work at home for no pay. She reluctantly let me try my luck but didn’t have high hopes.\\n\\nI proved her wrong and was quite smug about it. All I did was to walk into the store a week after it opened, ask for the manager and explained that I was looking for a job. He sat me down, explained the terms and did the expected song and dance. I left my phone number with him and lo and behold, he called the next morning asking when I could begin. I began the following morning.\\n\\nMy tasks consisted of doing anything at the store with two exceptions: I could not operate the fryer as you first had to pass a course and I could not do deliveries as I did not have a two-wheeler license. Anything else was fair game and I manned the counter, served customers, cleaned toilets, manned the take-out counter and yes, mopped the floor.\\n\\nMy hours were 9 AM – 7 PM and the store opened at 10 AM. The first hour was spent preparing the store for the onslaught of the McDonald’s-craving indian junta many of whom were sinister vegetarians. I say sinister because if these people had their way, they would crucify anyone who ate meat. Since they could not do this, they resorted to making a nuisance of themselves everywhere they went. At home, they thought nothing of abusing the labour of a lower-caste servant and would force said servant to eat and drink from separate utensils. Anything that came into contact with a meat-eater was deemed to have been defiled and must be purified by magic incantations and ritual cleansing with water. These same people once called the police because my family was cooking fish. The irony of eating food at a restaurant that also served chicken was lost on them but that’s partly because they love the gora and anything that the gora sells to them.\\n\\nAnyhow, once the doors opened at 10 AM, the first wave of customers was invariably college students. Decent people but fairly docile. They viewed McDonald’s servings as the quail and manna of the gods and would rarely complain if the food was substandard which it often was. The evening mom crowd, though, was another story.\\n\\n#Half information is a dangerous thing\\n\\nOne Friday evening, I was at the counter when a well-fed gujurati lady walked up with her well-fed son. They ordered a happy meal for the young meatball and a veggie burger and a coke for madam. There is an internet rumour that chains like McDonalds cheat customers on Coca-Cola by including too much ice. This is not entirely true. The reality is that the syrup coming out of the machine is not entirely diluted and the ice is there for two reasons: to keep the drink cold and to add water. The woman was not aware of this and I served her drink with the standard half-cup of ice. She walked away, found a table and took offence almost immediately. To set the scene, lines when McDonalds first opened in the Bombay suburbs were fairly long and they only kept growing through the day. This woman cuts to the front of the line and accuses me of cheating her with the coke. I said that it was standard practice and even offered to replace her drink with another one. She agreed but kept shouting that I was a cheater. Ok.\\n\\nI filled a new cup with the coke syrup from the machine and proceeded to add cold water from the fridge. She started screaming at this point and demanded that I fill the cup with the syrup. I acquiesced. She walked away with a cup of sugary coke syrup. One customer later, she was back and again shouted at me and accused me of cheating. I said that I had done exactly as she has asked to which she replied “is that how you talk to your mother” and flung the contents of the cup at my face.\\n\\nIndians have this disgusting and mistaken belief that if they pay for a service, they own the service staff. Anecdotally, this seems to be prevalent among the upper castes. The manager appeared on the scene because of the commission and sided with the woman. In india, the word of a woman is taken as gospel and the man is automatically the target of the ire of a lynch mob. I was lucky that no violence was involved. At the end of this scene, the front half of my body was a sticky, sugary mess and the woman walked away with a 1000 rupee voucher.\\n\\n#Beggars\\n\\nMcDonalds have a “food slide” between the kitchen and the counters which is essentially an inclined, stainless steel chute with multiple lanes for food. Once placed, anything on the slide must be on a customer’s place within 90 seconds or it would be binned. Perfectly good food would be binned because it was getting cold. I decided to do a good deed and found a clean bag into which I deposited food from the slide. Good burgers, plenty of fries and a smattering of other “food”. Once done for the day, I took this bag outside and began handing its contents out to the beggars on the street. I was soon mobbed by several but had enough food to go around. They seemed grateful but I did not know what was in store.\\n\\nThe next morning, as soon as the shutters were raised, within literally seconds, about 100 beggars began banging on the glass window panes demanding food. The manager was called and Ashutosh was not pleased when it was revealed that I the naive was the culprit. I still gathered the food but I took it to the local church and left it to them to distribute it.\\n\\n#Space hogs\\n\\nAlthough it has chairs and tables, McDonalds is a sit-down restaurant in the same way that Bombay is a world class city. This, however, would not deter our local business men (read thugs and politicians) from trying to hold business meetings in the restaurant. One fine evening during the rush hour, we had a local politician from the Congress show up, demand food and to the surprise of everyone there, actually pay for it. He then took his entourage and demanded that seated customers pay obeisance to him by vacating their tables. This being India, they complied and the man proceeded to have a 4 hour and 26 minute meeting there with a party of 24 people. I know because we kept notes. He paid for a big mac and a portion of fries.\\n\\n#Midnight in Gujarat\\n\\nAnyone who’s lived near Gujjus will know that many, many gujjus who run their own business have a tendency to eat dinner at 10 PM. McDonalds closed at 10 PM according to the signs but 21:54 was when a torrent of pot-bellied gujju uncles with their puffed-poori wives and kids would line up outside the take-away counter. Although the seating area was off-limits and the front door was closed, Ashutosh would not say no to paying customers. To these gujjus, the sliced buns of McDonald’s bread was like the parted waters of the red sea and I was their Moses. I was often stunned at how much these people ate. I’m a skinny person and I could not eat more than two large McDonald’s burgers. I once saw a man eat 4. In 5 minutes. I worry for his arteries and his wife’s hips.\\n\\n#Marathi Manoos and the Sena\\n\\nFish was once served at our restaurant though it was soon taken off the menu after a group of angry nativists protested. They showed up with the constabulary and orange flags, some with snarling tigers on them and demanded that we stop selling fish, which is apparently haram in staunch Maharashtrian circles. Ashutosh caved and the offending Piscean meat was removed. Another time, the cops showed up with booze and demanded food. They did not pay but sat on the seats, drank and laughed like louts. In the land of the poor, the police are the mafia.\\n\\nIn all, my experience with McDonalds was decent. I worked three months including most of my vacation. I worked 12 hours most days and was paid 350 rupees for each day’s work with no overtime. I worked 6 days a week but the restaurant was open all 7 days, 9 AM – 11 PM for staff (customer hours were shorter). I had the distinct advantage of getting in early when the chain was new and had few employees. I also had the advantage of speaking fairly decent English at a time when most employees did not. If you’re considering this as an option to make some money, things may have changed more recently. I would not recommend eating McDonald’s food regularly. Even the church where I would deposit unused food asked that I stop brining any over. They did not like it because it was oily and would not spoil, the latter causing much suspicion about the contents of the food.\\n\\nThese were my stories from my time there.

The entire Story has emerged from some right wing corner in the US. A Trump supporting couple self prescribed themselves chloroquine after Trump described it as a 'miracle'. The man died and the woman was admitted to intensive care.\\n\\nBest to placate Trump by giving him his snake oil and keep enough for our reasonable internal use instead of stockpiling. Next thing you know he's threatening 3M India and they stop making N95 masks. It's just Trump's and mudis pr stunt\", ' Someone matched with me just to tell me that I\\'m fat. Cat 1:- General \"Follow me\" influencers + Bots, nearly same thing.\\n\\nCat 2:- Girls looking out for validation atmost.\\n\\nCat 3:- Looking out for true love on Tinder or maybe comfortable future, who knows. Doesn\\'t know any good man in thirsty as fuck society like ours.\\n\\nCat 4:- Past-the-wall Aunties. Too cumbersome to filter out + prefer foreigners, I don\\'t blame them. Lack of matches I used Tinder on and off when I was in India, Bumble not so much. Went out on 3-4 dates and matched with decent number of women. This is over 2 years so no achievement.\\n\\nI don\\'t use them now. Reason being that I feel that most women over there are just killing time. And I can understand why. In a country like India where the dating scene is quite imbalanced women don\\'t need apps to go out on dates. Especially when India isn\\'t a safe country for women too. \\n\\nNot to mention if you\\'re an average looking guy the odds aren\\'t in your favour. So I have to make conversations with so many women which don\\'t go anywhere and it just gets tiring. Most of the times it is obvious that the girls never had an intention of meeting.\\n\\nAlso I feel that dating apps usually attract lazy people. I am myself lazy and I don\\'t have the energy to go out and socialize and try meeting women. So I try to swipe left and write sitting on my sofa in the hope of getting a date. I feel the same applies to women. The girls on Tinder, more often than not are too lazy, undecided or uninterested in taking any action. I had used Tinder in US for only 2-3 days while on a trip, got good matches. Not a single match in India in 2-3 years. I don\\'t use it regularly though, one or two times in a couple of months.\\n\\nAnd Indian Tinder is filled with fake profiles and who-knows-what-they-think pictures (at least in my location), I have to swipe left on like 10 profiles to come across 1 genuine profile, and still no match! Is it just me who read the first word wrongly ? -What made me stop ?\\n\\n\\n-Marriage I don\\'t know. People aren\\'t \\'real\\' on there. Girls hide 75% of their face/body and when you meet them it\\'s like \"Woah who tf are you?\". Most girls just want to feel better that someone prefers them. I haven’t stopped, I just use it less often these days cause work is mad hectic right now.\\n\\nBumble and hinge work well for me. Tinder is shit, it’s pretty much become pay to use/get seen ( at least for dudes).', \" I haven't found a Indian yet who believes earth is flat.

So it looks like they have a voice, but they really don't. Take it as a sign of how developed their countries are that they can have silly debates whether Earth is flat or not and should kids be vaccinated or not.\\n\\nWe have far more serious issues to worry about.

India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. \\n\\nFirst of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. \\n\\nNobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. \\n\\nNext, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. \\n\\nWhere you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. \\n\\nMoreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. \\n\\nAnd finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? \\n\\nEven regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”\\n\\nYour view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. \\n\\nI don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. \\n\\nAgain, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don\\'t need religion really. Now it\\'s only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are \"spiritual\"). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn\\'t have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:\\n\\n1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.\\n\\n2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.\\n\\n3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.\\n\\nBtw, what is your definition of evil?

It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or\\xa0patriline. Generally the gotra forms an\\xa0exogamous\\xa0unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as\\xa0incest.[1]\\xa0The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes.\\xa0Pāṇinidefines\\xa0gotra\\xa0for grammatical purposes as\\xa0apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram\\xa0(IV. 1. 162), which means \"the word\\xa0gotra\\xa0denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son\\'s son.\" When a person says \"I am Vipparla-gotra\", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.\\n\\nAccording to the\\xa0Brihadaranyaka\\xa0Upanisad2.2.6,\\xa0Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya\\xa0are seven sages (also known as\\xa0saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called\\xa0gotrâvayava.[2]\\n\\nOne who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as\\xa0tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is\\xa0pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is\\xa0sapta-rishaye.\\n\\nThere exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises\\xa0pravaras.\\n\\n Basically representing the ancestor.\\ne.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.\\n\\nGotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it.

There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra \\'logic\\':\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1933302.The\\\\_Seed\\\\_and\\\\_the\\\\_Soil](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1933302.The_Seed_and_the_Soil)\\n\\n>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman\\'s body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women\\'s nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.  \\n>  \\n>  \\n>  \\n>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed.

[removed] [deleted] [removed]', \" You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.\\n\\nAlso, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.\\n\\nFirst, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.\\nIndians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.\\nThis explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.\\n\\nIts definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.\\n\\nThe next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. \\n\\nQuite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.\\n\\nHaving said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.\\n\\nThe real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. \\n\\nEating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.\\n\\nRegarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nI also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that.

Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. \\n\\nIf there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! 😁 Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.\\n\\nNow man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.\\n\\nDon't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.\\n\\nThe responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. \\n\\nNo matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  \\n\\nSo good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There’s a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  \\nYou just run smack into it. \\n\\nShe’s just like the majority.\\n\\n(Most) Indian women simply don’t do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....\\n\\nUnlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I’m sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her? Well I would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them. In many cases I have seen, Indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely. I would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust. That person can put in a good word to make things easier.\\nOn a lighter note: Watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, it's a similar situation (to some extent). Understandably, she does not want to\\n\\nHurt her family's standings\\nCause her family grief and pain\\nBasically get shunned and exiled from her family.... \\n\\n\\nThe ball is in her court. She needs to think independently and get this sorted. \\n\\nOn the other hand,  I hope she loves you truly and not just because you're from a European country or for financial independence. You need to make this very clear. \\n\\nPlease think twice before you proceed. \\nSome Indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist. \\n\\nHer parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future. I'm also a  minor victim of this. \\n\\n grandkids have fixed some of the relationships. your mileage may vary. Well I am late here. But all the best OP!\\n\\nI hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you. \\n\\nIn the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life ( I am sorry but that's how they work in India) and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them, there are possibilities. \\n\\nThis would be a harsh test of her character and your patience, but I hope you guys come through.

There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. \\n\\nThis is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. \\n\\nSecondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. \\n\\nThe problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don\\'t question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn\\'t for well staffed public services. Also, it\\'s high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country.

Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. \\n\\nI\\'ll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I\\'ll try to write up some new parts which you didn\\'t touch on.\\n__________________________________________________________\\n\\n**First part**\\n\\n> Slow but Steady: Western Economies\\n\\n> Accelerated Growth: East Asia\\n\\nThis is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can\\'t rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That\\'s the path of export-led manufacturing growth. \\n\\nMost people mistakenly think this is the \"East Asian\" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. \\n\\nSome people claim India can\\'t replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I\\'ll be brief on both.\\n\\nAs far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It\\'s just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called \"auxiliary services\". They don\\'t get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren\\'t nearly as bad as it\\'s made out to be.\\n\\nAs for trade/protectionism is concerned, it\\'s true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn\\'t really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven\\'t been able to crack the apparels segment.\\n\\nOur largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. \\n\\nIn footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  \\n\\n> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. \\n\\nSemantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  \\n\\nUsing such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  \\n\\nThe fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  \\nMeaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  \\n\\nAs for the point on why India has under-performed.  \\n\\nThe fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  \\n\\nThings like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  \\nThis a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  \\nThen at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  \\n\\nEverything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  \\n\\nIts no wonder things wouldn\\'t be smooth sailing. \\n\\nAnd about What India needs.  \\nI am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  \\n\\nHelping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   \\n\\nCurrently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   \\n\\nCurrently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30\\'s.  \\nTo me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.\\n\\nIndustrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.\\n\\n* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn\\'t want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.\\n\\n* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.\\n\\n* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don\\'t work for people unless someone attacks them.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. \\n\\nIt\\'s disheartening that the comments don\\'t have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it\\'s population in farming and yet it\\'s very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. \\n\\nManufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development.

These are tangentially related.             \\nDoes this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? Is it a place for discussion only or reddit India supported activism?  For example Net neutrality debate. I think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl. It encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices.          \\nI think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like NN which lead to brigading in real life.  Shouldn\\'t have happened.            \\nSecond, do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? And is there a criteria. I  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted.

Aand thats how you make a dead sub...btw instead of these useless flairs why not make a \"Delhi\" flair to filter it out all the useless AAP posts. I have a moderation related questions.   \\n\\nWhen Moderators delete a post, I have seen 3 kinds of things happening.\\n\\n1. A comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   \\n2.

Why not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation?   \\n Add a flair for geopolitics.  AskIndia is good but I don\\'t think Governance flair would be used often.

Additionally, if you do decide to go ahead with it, why just images and not audio/video?\\n\\n- Could you clarify what a \"low-effort\" political self-post would be? Would all such content need to be backed up by data or are opinion pieces also allowed?

[deleted] \"Governance\" flair is an interesting idea. Not sure how much traction it will get but it\\'s worth a shot. There is a very urgent need to separate political bullshit and rhetoric from actual impactful decisions that political parties are taking.  I am very against these ideas of writing essay for self posts. I have already expressed my opinion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3d8epc/is_noise_drowning_out_the_signal_in_rindia/ct2to3p):\\n\\n> and low-effort content is always upvoted to the top\\n\\nsubjective. people upvote what they like\\n\\n> Remove low-effort political self-posts.\\n> \\n> No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.\\n\\nit\\'s censorship. mods shouldn\\'t decide what is \\'low-effort\\' and what is not. the members of community should.\\n\\nand not everyone wants to read a essay about why submitted an image of some tweet. \\n\\n>  /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards.\\n\\nPeople like it. Let them decide what they want by uproots/downvotes.\\n\\n We need more flairs. Arts, Movies, Books, TV, etc etc. \\n\\nWe need weekly threads for different topics. Can we automate this please?

You have my vote on this.\\n\\nPlease bring more flairs other than AskIndia/HelpIndia like Sports & Entertainment. Please have more weekly threads like those tech threads & also sticky those threads so more people comment. Thanks for taking the initiative, the new flairs sound like a good idea, implementing them, a far bigger proposition, but doable!!    \\n>Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced         \\n\\nThis needs to be done. I know it is a big task for the mods, but its the need of the hour! You can find people who are actually driven to do this, and if implemented,along with removal of low effort self posts, will be a welcome respite, and greatly improve the quality of political discourse in the sub.    \\n\\nAgain thanks for trying to bring about a change and I wish you guys all the luck to go through with it. you\\'ll need it :) Could we limit the posts with personal questions and rants? They\\'re almost always unverified, troll bait and conform to the subs circlejerks.\\n\\nI\\'d love to see more moderation of those posts than deleting \"Chaddis vs AAPtards\" kind of comments. The latter get downvoted pretty often, anyway. Could you post some guidelines about downvoting that people will see more prominently when they are about to downvote?\\n\\nRight now whenever someone sees something they don\\'t agree with, it is downvoted to oblivion and it fosters a kind of circlejerk where you only see the majority opinion and anything that disagrees just disappears.\\n\\nOther options might include keeping the threads in contest mode for a longer time. I used to avoid /r/India like the plague, but now I\\'m starting to see a lot of intriguing discussions. I still disagree with some people, but we are able to discuss in a logical and informed manner, as opposed to the childish, irrational, and chauvinist way people were a while back.\\n\\nRe-subscribed. 1. Strictly objective rules. Remove all subjective interpretation from rules. This continues the situation of \"we have fallen short\" remark. When there is no objectivity, two people can have a different opinion about the same comment, and then a rule ceases to be a rule and becomes an opinion. \\n2. Self posts for images. Well, there is already a work-around and loophole in current rules where users can post a collage of more than one twitter screenshot and not use exact title rule. Self post provides an easier editorializing of the title. Exactly how will this help reducing shitpost is unclear to me. \\n3. New common account that is purely for communication. Does this mean you are now willing to discuss controversial mod decisions in public? This will help the community to understand the thought that went behind deleting some comment or thread and what was the subjective reasoning used? Unless subjective decisions are discussed and debated, these rules are just anchors of imposing your opinion on mod activities. Any comment can be constructed to violate any random rule because \"I felt so\" without any accountability to the community! Modmail is just a safety net because you are afraid that you may have been wrong and 15 people collectively pouncing on one person is better that 300+ people pouncing on the mods for a wrong decision.  Media,Random,Other.\\n\\n\\nI guess these will be cool flairs. [deleted] Good points...personally, am in complete agreement  *AskIndia*   *Governance*  what do this flairs even mean? \\n\\nAnd how am I suppose to make a self post on a meme in NP category? Defeats the purpose of Memes doesn\\'t it? Thought this place would be more open and free. Definitely need a Political sub and also rules \\'only where needed\\'.  [deleted] >Remove low-effort political self-posts.\\n\\nWho is going to decide this ?\\nAs it is, there is already too much censorship in a so called platform for free speech.

Would be nice to have more music related posts. Especially folk music from different parts of the country. Please ban twitter and facebook from unverified accounts altogether.

Do these things actually take a beating?\\n\\nThese things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  \\n\\nMy personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. \\n\\nAt the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage. I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. \\nThere will be problems and bitter feelings initially. \\nYour first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? \\nIf you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. \\n\\nStand up for yourself. This is your life. Don\\'t let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. \\n\\nGood luck! \\n\\nEdit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again?  > Will it really affect my sister\\'s wedding?\\n\\nIf arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn\\'t want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.\\n\\n> What is \"standing in the society\", or \"prestige\". Do these things actually take a beating?\\n\\nThis is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.\\n\\nIt frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl\\'s parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband\\'s family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.\\n\\nSo if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their \"prestige\" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision. I can\\'t answer this question. But you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about non-trolling answers.  If someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldn\\'t be marrying the guy anyway.\\n\\nJust my .02 rupee. Here is what i think , I think you are making a mistake. Leave her now.\\n\\nHere is why?\\n\\nIf you wanted to be with that girl , absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter. No one and i mean no one has a right on your future life. You and your partner have to be the only ones to decide. So even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked, i posit that you are not really into her.\\n\\nDrop it now, not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her.\\n\\n\\n Honor Killing is a possibility... They\\'ll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the ~~goats~~ gaus.. \\n\\nBut seriously.. Fuck the orthodoxy.. If you want Indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows.. \\n\\nScrew your parents.. (Not literally).. Your sister will be fine.. Its not like she\\'s gonna be married the next day of your own marriage.. \\n\\nChill..Marry...Repent..  Evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one. If the answer is yes, other things don\\'t matter. \\n\\nTime heals everything and when your parents/relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position.  Editing a few spelling mistakes. > Will it really affect my sister\\'s wedding?\\n\\nYes it will, Rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this. Both my sisters are Married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my Dad because of this (I am not pushing for Marriage, my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done.). But the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch, one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family. So that\\'s that. If you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own, then don\\'t worry.\\n\\n> What is \"standing in the society\", or \"prestige\". Do these things actually take a beating?\\n\\nAsshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years, after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing. If you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your GF then do go ahead and not let the Samaj bother you. If you are both outside India, then why don\\'t you marry there. Nobody will really care in a few years.', ' what about flair for **science** lets discuss science articles also , it will be very useful for learning new things  [deleted] >but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation\\n\\nThis is quite a violation, no?\\n\\nI\\'m sure you will say that if you want to critique, bring it up within /r/india and not outside? But /r/subredditdrama can, while indulging in schadenfreude, still keep us on our toes instead of giving one the feeling that critique is being swept under the carpet. [deleted] I have hidden the score for 60 minutes for now, but I believe given the traffic in /r/India the comment scores should be hidden for 120 minutes. Thoughts? Can the OP be Highlighted more clearly? Its just a more saturated blue, which isn\\'t easy to figure out. For example, most subs have a Blue Background box behind OP name when submitting comments. Can we at least get some Indian mods? Someone who respects Indian sensibilities? Someone who understands, recognises and agrees with the democratic opinion of the country? \\n\\nActually, I know the answer. Take it up your own modmail. \\n > * Clarification on Flairs\\n\\nThis clarification has been a long time coming. You should have given this clarification *before* banning people from the sub for it. Anyways, better late than never.\\n\\n> * Score hiding\\n> * New moderator\\n> * Repost removal\\n\\nAll good steps. I congratulate the mod team. Why has this thread been posted so late in the night?\\n\\nWouldn\\'t the more logical thing be to post it during India hours when most active subscribers are awake? > Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves.

The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We\\'ll keep this rule going for now.\\n \\nNope. It\\'s become a lot more intolerant community which believes in violently criticizing groups of people or people in public but cannot take a personal insult when called to question on it. If you delight in shaming people you don\\'t know from the comforts of your keyboard, it\\'d be hypocritic not to be ready to take insults in return.\\n\\n> Can bringing up a user\\'s posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.\\n\\nBullshit. So is the unverified twitter account rule.\\n\\n> Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof , but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit\\'s request. Please keep other subs\\' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.\\n\\nCan (and is) abused.

Bad titling?\\n\\n> Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit\\n\\nAbsolutely no point to this. Leave it to the user\\'s intelligence.\\n\\nAdding a question, why is **pure theology** as /u/rahulthewall puts it is **banned** in this subreddit? Isn\\'t this also a sub where history is discussed. A verse of the Rig Veda was banned while an article talking about Hindu mythology in medium.com was allowed. Clarify your stand. If you\\'re supporting banning it in the future, that\\'s stupid.\\n\\nThe twitter flair is a nice idea BTW. score hiding will be awesome. good job mods!\\n\\nps. would never want to become mod. too much hardwork. you guys are good keep it up Can you put multiple flairs on the same post? i.e. if I post an article which is more than 6 months old about a political subject - what should I flair it as?   \\n\\nWhat if it\\'s a Twitter comment which is political and more than 6 months old?   \\n >Can bringing up a user\\'s posting history be classified as a personal attack?

Like /r/europe has on the top.\\n\\nAlso sometimes exact title rule doesn\\'t really tell what is in the article. So for that something like *editorialized* flair should be there.\\n\\nAnd now some queries - how much time should we wait for the mods to respond if the modmail is sent? Does *Repost removal policy* apply only to that article from one source or other sources too? Because different sources have difference in how the story is presented >About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to ban all links from these sites. Just the ones that have embedded YouTube/Vimeo videos. \\n\\nAlso, could you guys have AutoMod notify us every time a comment that breaks the rule is deleted. I use c*unt a lot, and it seems to be a word that is monitored closely. Often I\\'ve noticed that my comments carrying the word get deleted even when used in a non-sexist or satirical context. I would like to know if/when any of my comments are deleted. I don\\'t see what\\'s wrong with it.  Thanks for the flairs!\\n\\nEdit: I still see two flairs only.

Is that why they are completely immune and get a blank check to do whatever they like? Please clarify.  BTW mods, I\\'d appreciate if you applied the \\'won\\'t show downvotes\\' rule for new threads as well, because me and other posters identified as \\'bhakts\\' or \\'Sanghis\\' have been facing very furious and concerted downvote herding from r/india\\'s \\'secular\\' posters and lurkers. \\n\\nEvery new thread I\\'ve posted in the last couple of weeks has been quickly downvoted to keep its score near 0 and usually certain posters keep topping that up every few minutes to ensure it never gets more than a few total votes and stays far off the front page. \\n\\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2nxcat/islamic_state_has_special_plans_for_india_majeed/\\n\\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2nuder/headley_saga_mumbai_attack_was_a_joint/\\n\\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2ntpgc/sachin_tendulkar_once_played_with_tissues_in/\\n > Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)\\n\\nBollywood and Art are mutually exclusive. :P [deleted] >  Additionally cross posting to /r/pakistan[4] in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india[5] on the subreddit\\'s request\\n\\nSorry- so no xposting of content from rindia to rpakistan?', \" /r/indianbabes [NSFW] is very active. >Indian Politics - Dead\\n\\nYeah and not just the subreddit.

[removed] All those people who are amused by it this is what happens when you give them some infrastructure.  \\n\\nWith Air conditioned trains the doors are closed and open only when the train actually stops.  So you have to wait anyway. \\n\\nWith other locals I have seen even auntys  board the train before it actually stops so that they can grab a seat.  No way they will wait for the train to stop because some other aunty would have grabbed the seat by then. \\n\\nNow if you really want to ensure people queue up start installing platform screening doors.  But that's expensive and I don't have any expectations from Indian railways.   Fake fake fake! OP paid the people to stand in a line! Only if this was followed for every other train too, every morning is a fight to get into a Churchgate bound train Wtf is happening? In which alternate universe is this borivali station located? Propaganda. Next thing you know they will tell that first people will be allowed to get off the train and then people will board the train. Nonsense. Wonder how this happened? Was there constant messaging to nudge people to do this? How did you manage to travel to a parallel universe? History time. When I was growing up in Mumbai in  late '80s every bus stop south of Sion used to have an orderly line to board the bus. It was very similar to this [video](https://youtu.be/ats8Y1yzgPI?t=182). Somehow the suburbs were always unruly. \\n\\nCars waiting at red light was also very common and so was crossing street only when walk signal was on.\\n\\nBut there was always mad rush to board the trains. This is very refreshing.\\n\\n Queue!? ab ye kaunsi nayi western concept laye ho?\\n\\nHamare sanskriti mai koi queue nahi hota.Kabhi sunna hai pushpak viman mai chadte waqt log queue mai kadhe the?  If I were first in line, I'd just be terrified that the entire line will push forward at anytime even before the train arrives.  I recently made a trip to europe and I was amused to see how the locals were civil to other people. If there's something that Indians need to badly improve - its being civil to others. That huge fan though. People of Mumbai always surprise. The roads are crowded but flow is always smooth Its because its an A/C TRAIN. CIVILISED PEOPLE USE IT. JUST SAYIN  Yay, Mumbai! But there should be markers so that people can queue up on either side of the door and let people alight properly first. After looking this picture I am crying from inside.  Wait there are AC trains on the local lines? I catch a train from andheri in the evening everyday and this is a common sight only in the women's compartment though.. great to watch.\\n\\nAlso, andheri station is jam-packed in the morning and people had to literally fight for climbing up. The last two months have seen a major change and Now everyone stands in a proper queue Wow, this is the India I want to see.  Haath pe chapti maar re. Oh wait...... that's central line. Don't know when central line will become decent. Good to see some positive story since  ages This can only happen in non-rush hours in Mumbai Locals. \\n\\nIf people start queuing at rush hour the line will stretch for 2 kms outside the station.  Aaja Bhai Tu Bhi Line Mein This is a very interesting experiment in Indian behaviour.\\n\\n1. If you somehow project the idea of discipline onto people, 95% of them will follow. 50% of these will be rowdy and lawless while taking a local train but will suddenly stand in line because there's a line expected or being formed in front of them in the metro [I've seen this happen IRL].\\n\\n And while the line collapses pretty soon, it is still an attempt at order which partially succeeds in two ways - people can alight without battling through a wave of incoming bodies, and folks who are right in the front of these lines get assured seating/standing of their choice.\\n\\n2. You will see people blatantly flouting rules, throwing their garbage on the floor etc. on normal train platforms. But our metro stations? They're some of the cleanest places in India. Just look at the difference in India's metros - be it Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai... The cities is filthy, the metro system is clean as a whistle.\\n\\n3. The security system works. Not for its intended role, but it keeps loose food and drink outside the metro system.\\n\\nI believe civic planners and govt officials can learn some lessons here. *Rechecks*\\nAm I on the right sub reddit ? \\n*Rechecks* There is hope for the country. Demonitization actually had a few benefits!!! Next thing you know people will stop littering.  Then when the streets are clean the cops will stop beating and extorting street vendors and the poor.  Then that will have a snowball effect, and the road workers will start repairing roads with enthusiasm.  Traffic will move smoother and people will be in a better mood, they'll stop going out at night to rape innocent women and children.\\n\\nFinally, the politicians will see all this and ask for 2% less bribe. This works only until the train arrives. Then it's a free for all. Nice quality! Which camera? Which station? And then there's that one mandatory asshole who decides to jump the queue and plunges everyone into the usual state of chaos.

Sandwich massage for free I can confirm that this happens in the gold class of dubai metro whereas as in normal compartments people just rush in and out like in india They do this in nyc too........

She sees you as a friend and has made it clear that she is not interested in you for anything intimate. It's best for you to use your emotions somewhere else. If you don't believe me then ask her clearly, saying hey <her name>, do you think we two could be together as a couple. She will give you a straight no. Start flirting with her. Take it slowly but definitely let her get the hint that you are interested in being more than just friends with her. You have hidden your intentions so far out of fear and maintaining this act is not going to help you. Some Chad might come into her life and take her away from you. If you don't tell her she'll never know. She also might have feelings for you that you don't know about. Be brave and tell her that you like her, but be subtle about it. See how she responds and then take it from there. Itna sudhra hua na Bano ki saamne vaale ko lage ki asexual ho Stop being her gay BFF and ask her out already. Otherwise, like the other guy said, emotional tampon bane reh jaoge.

[deleted] [deleted] I don\\'t think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an \"evil\" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they\\'ve committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  \\n\\nIMHO, he\\'s raising awareness about the atrocities that they\\'ve committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor\\'s main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in \\'India Unbound\\'. But I don\\'t think it really contradicts Tharoor\\'s claims . Everyone of Das\\' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding \"India\" back but he let\\'s the Brits go Scott free.\\n\\nYes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a \"Indian\" structural head who could\\'ve changed things or we could\\'ve had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. \\n\\nThe drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the \"gifts\" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb\\'s tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad\\'s Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could\\'ve been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn\\'t be as poor as we are now.\\n\\nA book came out last year called \"Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830\" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. \\n\\nHe makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. \\n >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. \\n\\nI\\'m done. I wouldn\\'t call 100+ of looting and injustice \"peaceful.\" Have read the whole thing.\\nThe Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.\\n\\nTaking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.\\n\\nThis they did by creating:\\nLow literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you\\'ll fail to compete.)\\n\\nUnstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn\\'t moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn\\'t these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980\\'s they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can\\'t deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn\\'t right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let\\'s just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.\\n\\nPersonally I\\'m glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I\\'m sure most of our post independence governments wouldn\\'t have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. \\n\\nBoth Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor\\'s British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because \"he is one of us\". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the \"it\" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because \"they stand for Hindu values\" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife\\'s) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents\\' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.\\n\\nIt is really simplistic to claim Britain \"looted\" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India\\'s wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor\\'s fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he\\'s going to use this wave of false patriotism that\\'s been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is \"overall a good thing\" even if it did help turn someone\\'s life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West\\'s material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.\\n\\nAs I\\'ve been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides, accepting English IS decolonization.

The unstated part of the BJP-RSS relationship was that the Sangh chief, Sarsanghchalak in RSS parlance, himself would not show his hand. **The behind-the-scenes role for the minder was necessitated both by the 1949 undertaking to Patel and to overcome the strong political opposition to Hindutva. The governments of 1977-1979 and 1998-2004 became possible only because the RSS agreed to keep out of sight**.\\n\\n> ... **Cut to 1949 and the RSS’s undertaking to Patel to write a constitution, which, among other things, would specify that the Sangh had “no politics” and would remain “devoted purely to cultural work” (Article 4(b) of the RSS constitution; D.R. Goyal, 1979). The written constitution was Patel’s pre-condition for lifting the ban imposed on the RSS in the wake of Mahatma Gandhi’s January 30, 1948 assassination**.\\n\\n> ... On November 14, 1948, the Home Ministry held by Patel issued a press note which said Golwalkar wanted the ban lifted without agreeing to the government’s demand that the RSS reform itself. Further, the note quoted information received from the provincial governments, which showed “**that the activities carried on in various forms and ways by the people associated with the RSS tend to be anti-national and often subversive and violent and that persistent attempts are being made by the RSS to revive an atmosphere in the country which was productive of such disastrous consequences in the past…**”\\n\\n> ... The letter of September 11, 1948, was to Golwalkar himself. In this Patel lauded the RSS for its service to Hindu society even as he outlined the “**objectionable part**” which “**arose when they, burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmaans …” Further, “As a final result of the (communal) poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of Gandhiji …**” Patel said people’s opposition to the RSS grew when “**the RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji’s death.**” Well.

I will be very interested in knowing his thoughts behind:\\n\\n1. How does he plan to have incentives aligned with success of Housing.com/convince investors that he is motivated, after giving away all his equity to employees. \\n\\n2. Is there a grey market for Housing.com shares. How can employees monetize the gift?\\n\\n3. Isn\\'t there regulation in India, that constrain private firms to have less than 50 investors, before becoming public. In that case, how can the shares be transferred to employees?\\n\\n4. I have tracked Zillow/Trulia for a while. These firms have mapped a larger geography, and onboarded about a 100,000 agents to pay for ads connected to Zip codes. Still they are struggling with their bottomline, agent retention and agent up selling (They treat agents as their revenue sources, not end use customer). If Housing.com will be following a similar model, is it having success in onboarding agents? Is it having trouble with the unorganized/informal nature of real estate agents? What is being done to mitigate it?\\n\\n5. Are the online only flash sales of apartments generating any revenue at all? Is it a sustainable model for the future?\\n\\n6. What happened behind the scenes and how were the board members pacified to retain the CEO? How did men with big egos and the cash to boost, look beyond the tantrums to come to a rational decision?

In that chain of arguments there is a dual process. One is that high growth means more jobs. So if the poor have more jobs, they will have more income. Two, if there’s growth, the economy expands and taxes go up.\\n\\n> *  With that money, you can fund anti-poverty programmes. On the face of it, this is a plausible argument. But it doesn’t always work. For instance, even in the highest growth period in India, **say between 2003-08**, most of the evidence shows that employment didn’t grow much.\\n\\nHere is [Livemint\\'s Claim Check](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fI98V9JE8uOmAhVS0fjhQO/Claim-Check-Narendra-Modi-on-jobs-created-by-NDA-vs-UPA.html) on the topic:\\n\\n>Claim: The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government created 60 million jobs during its tenure in 1999-2005 as against 2.7 million created during 2004-2009 under the current United Progressive Alliance government.\\n\\n> Who: Narendra Modi.\\n\\n> Where: At a rally in Rohini, Delhi.\\n\\n> Check: Modi is right.

Japan and India are two entirely different animals.\\n\\nJapan has an ageing workforce. It also has a work environment that emphasises employees working long hours. The stress had in recent times resulted in multiple news reports of employees committing suicide which had prompted a national outcry and condemnation.\\n\\nIn addition to this, the work-nolife balance also resulted in men and women choosing to marry late or choosing to delay having children. This isn\\'t good considering the already low population growth rate in the country. This has even led to the mechanisation of many low end jobs in Japan because they can\\'t find enough people to work.\\n\\nSo a 4 day work week might work in a country like Japan which is carrying out iniatives in order to promote population growth. The 4 day work week has a high synergy with these objectives.\\n\\nIndia meanwhile has a high population growth, high unemployment and a young workforce. The competition here has prompted firms to cut costs in order to maintain profit. This often means a smaller workforce, which still does the same amount of work by taking longer hours; but without any commiserate increase in remuneration. \\n\\nEven when an employee is burned out, the rat race in India is so bad that there is always an enormous pool of often unemployed/underemployed applicants who are ready to be hired at short notice for a lower pay. So the employers can simply choose to fire the burned out employees and hire new recruits to keep the assembly line at work.\\n\\nLong story short: In Japan, employees are still a key human resource.

Now even Saturday and Sunday leave is a problem. Either you have to work om weekends due to some emergency or they load you with so much work and such deadlines that you end up working on weekend.

I was recently ghosted by a startup for letting them know I wasn\\'t comfortable with their 6 day a week schedule (Monday to Saturday, every single week). Read on if you\\'re interested.  \\n\\n________________\\n\\n**Back story -**\\n\\nI recently interviewed at a startup for a tech role (Data Scientist) and was going through the final so-called \"cultural fit\" interview. I have almost 3 years of experience in the field. I currently work at a startup that works Monday to Friday (40 hours a week).   \\n\\nJust doing my due diligence, I asked the interviewer if they work on Saturdays. To my disappointment, he said they do. Now, this was my 5th interview round. Not once did they tell me about their Mon-Sat schedule. I only got to know because I asked. \\n\\nFor some context, this startup is 4 years old, have their product out in the market and have close to 30 employees (their claim - I was never invited to their office and all interviews happened on the phone in the course of a single week).   \\n\\nAs soon as I heard of their 6 day work schedule, I was disappointed. I mean, coming from a startup background myself, I understand the kind of hard work people need to put in every once in a while. Working on Saturdays during emergencies and other critical events is perfectly fine, but every single week? Come on! \\n\\nOh, and I also would get **no** equity for my work there.  \\n\\nBut working on weekends wasn\\'t necessarily a deal breaker to me. I just wanted to put myself in their shoes and know *why*. \\n\\nI mentioned to the guy upfront that my current organisation works 5 days a week, and that my life is built around a Mon-Fri schedule so it will be difficult to adjust to a 6 day work week.    \\n\\nThe guy must have realised my disappointment (this was on the phone), and so he started talking about how much potential this company has for growth and how much I could grow with the company. \\n\\n\\nAnyway, I wanted to ask them their rationale for working every Saturday the next time we spoke, and also to evaluate for myself whether sacrificing my social life and hobbies for a job was worth it. \\n\\nCoincidentally, this conversation happened on a Friday, I got a text message the next day (Saturday), saying \"Let\\'s close this today\". I had a long week and I switched off for the next two days and I didn\\'t respond until Monday. I apologised for the delay, saying that I took some time off for the weekend and was ready for a discussion.    \\n\\nThat was it. I never heard from them again. I never said no to working on Saturdays, but still they ghosted me. I guess they wanted someone who would be submissive and not question their wisdom. \\n\\nWhich is a shame, because the product (from what they told me, seemed interesting) but some of my friends say this was good riddance. Part of the problem is that our labour regulations and enforcement is, mildly put, absolutely terrible. Looking at indian labour laws is a crash course in the necessity of updating laws to new circumstances and the need to discard old laws in an expeditious manner rather than just getting by on the courts desperately trying to make the woefully inadequate laws fit the needs of today.\\n\\nEven in sectors with massive deficits of required workers (such as medicine and law), the actual worker holds little power since regulations are lax and there\\'s no one powerful actually standing up for them. A doctor or lawyer, especially one that\\'s just starting out, will universally work long hours at the cost of his health; not because he\\'s easily replaced, but because his managers are, for the most part, so inept that it would be tragic if it weren\\'t hilarious. The iron law of wages is evident here for most to see.\\n\\nNow how this can be remedied is a task in and of itself. It starts right from said horribly convoluted and loophole riddled regulations to the rather asinine practices of promoting professionals to managerial positions based on their ability to do their original job (a good doctor or lawyer isn\\'t a good manager or leader) and linking payments to said promotions (which forces said professionals to seek such positions for better remuneration).\\n\\nAnd yes, there\\'s more to it than that, but the short answer is that the problem is very much systemic. This is as much cultural (if not more so) than it is economic. And that wages do not reflect demand or skill (otherwise we\\'d be paying the people who clean gutters more than any corporate CEO or hedge fund manager), they reflect status and power. 4 days working !! What a joke for Indian owners. I can see some of my friends are working on Saturdays also. Also, some are happy with their alternative Saturday holidays. I am sure as The sun that India will never implement this type of formula. Even government will do, Private company owners they will never spend a minute to think about it. You talking about 4 days working last month I worked on 2nd October without getting extra pay !! It\\'s not like I\\'m talking about small towns this scene is available in one of the Metro city in India and only officially declared heritage city of India :) Would never work with our work ethic. Already mondays and fridays half the day is gone in either reaching late after leave travels or leaving early for leave travel. I still know people working in 6 days week. Even I used to work 6 days few years back. Let\\'s make a uniform 5-day work week first. Better to learn to walk before attempting to run. [deleted] most of the work in India is about availability and not about capability , our work culture is a reflection of it ( in both public and private sectors ) , Being specific to IT companies we are mostly cost centres which do really little productive work hence the moment we go for a 3 day weekend thereby increasing cost , these jobs will be outsourced to a cheaper location. Also apart from the \\'**highly questionable work culture**\\' we also suffer from highly questionable work ethic , as employees some treat their job as time-pass activity  working as seat warmers. For these people a 3 day weekend is pointless.\\n\\n3 day weekend boost productivity which is amazing for people involved in demanding profiles, for this strategy to work in India we will need to have jobs that involve R&D ,planning or designing  . The problem is this kind of work demands attention and critical thinking, something our newer generation is quite not trained due to being spoon fed in schools with meaningless grades and ignored by professors in higher studies . Hence the 2nd thing will be reform our education system which emphasises more on thinking and less on following. It will work only if the office remains open six or seven days a week and there are alternate workers for those days which others have off.\\n\\nThat will kill both the unemployment problem and improve worker productivity. Might work where creativity is given large portion of importance..\\n\\nFor labour , essential services like hospital , it wont work , as this will hamper production in case of industries , and routine work procedure in case of health care industry. Service-based IT companies have their heads up their clients\\' asses. Middle and onsite managers make unrealistic promises to clients and make their subordinates work like a dog.\\n\\nMuch of this behavior stems from keeping their bosses happy, which was prevalent even during previous generations. So, I really don\\'t see this happening until the time companies choose to treat their employees with respect. Yes, but only if people stopped the casual chit-chat over chai breaks, numerous smoke breaks, discussing cricket/politics breaks, taking personal calls at work breaks, hour long lunches and so on. [deleted] [deleted] Will it benefit the people? Yes, Of course.  \\nWill it benefit the companies? In the long run, yes.\\n\\nI\\'d like to bring on a few points here:\\n\\n* Japan is a labour shortage economy, yet the country is so culturally driven that loyalty and long working hours is a norm. You will find a huge faction of the workforce working for their first company throughout their career.\\n* India on the other hand is a labour surplus, and that too at the number one spot. In short, if you don\\'t want to work long hours, there are literally thousands who would.\\n* This was done by just one company, Microsoft, which isn\\'t even Japanese. They just tried it as an experiment, and \\'might\\' do it again in the future.\\n* In a report produced a few months back, Indians turned out to be the employees taking the least holidays in the world. Technically it was correct, but didn\\'t mention the procedures, the unapprovals, the interrogation involved with leaves in India. With such an approach of the organisations towards employees where taking leaves is \"not caring about the well-being of the organisation\", there\\'s little hope of 4 day work-week.\\n\\nI am a Senior Manager- Human Resources in one of the top media companies, and no matter what the terminology is - Human Resource, Human Capital, Personnel, Talent, Pink Squirrels, HiPots - the companies (there are exceptions) know that unemployment rates are high and that they can choose to treat employees like robots with little to no consequences. I have worked in a 4 day shift model back in 2008 and 2009, we had to trade off weekends. My working days used to be tue, fri,sat,sun. First implement 5 days, 8 hrs/day properly.

Thought my states didnt had it this bad. Nice to see my home state doing good-ish here. Still 5% is 5% too much. Shit needs to stop. I am noticing a pattern when it comes to every major problem in India. Way to go --- dont forget your Northeast Indians --- they have put aside these old beliefs --- Hindi heartland could learn a thing or two.\\n\\nOne observation is the long-time communist run states like Kerala and W.Bengal and the emphasis on education --- most commendable for Kerala given what its historic caste structure and history of oppression has been, even W.Bengal with the oppressive Zamindari history.\\n\\nMaharashtra is interesting --- there is a common Marathi identity greater than other identifiers, possibly also the higher penchant for industry and economics.\\n\\nJust my 2 paise trying to understand how this can be explained. No more claiming of North is Progressive and South is Conservative!  \\nBeing conservative is good if you are Progressive within. In the context of this study, how are \"households practising untouchability\" defined? I was trying to see what it was from the link to the IHDS-II data, but I\\'m not savvy enough to figure it out.\\n\\nIn any case, I\\'m pleasantly surprised that Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala, and quite a few places in the North-East (except for the ones with no data) appear to have massively reduced the practice of untouchability in their regions. My state WB seem to do pretty well . If the data is right and good sample size is considered I\\'m aure it\\'ll be even better. Maharashtra Kerala and Bengal along with the far Eastern frontier states seems considerably exceptional. Pretty predictable. But did no Jyotiba Phule or Rammohan Roy or Vidyasagar emerge in these northern states? I mean, damn look at the amount of red... pretty depressing for India as a whole...

Really informative and insightful. Again, not surprising that the places also map out with [where the BJP won](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election#/media/File%3AIndian_General_Election_2019.svg). South India is far more progressive, clearly. I love how the colour for 0% and no data is the same.   \\nTN\\'s scenario isn\\'t as bad as I thought. Still pretty bad considering it looks more like a north Indian state than a south Indian state from this map. Its funny that people are supporting CAA and NRC to give prosecuted minorities from neighboring countries citizenship while there are far more minorities inside the country who face discrimination and what not on a daily basis but no one cares for their pain.\\nMakes me wonder if the CAA and NRC is just a political stunt for vote bank or the govt really cares about the minorities. And mainland Indians have the audacity to think that the Eastern states are junglee and un-civillised. \\n\\n\\nCompletely fed up of this bigotry. How has no one mentioned Bengal, as clean(no red spots) as Maharashtra if not more. The reforms that started here spread to the villages with the 40 year communist rule instilling the values into deeper sections of society and peripheral villages too. I\\'m not a proponent of hardcore communism, but I feel it has had it\\'s share of good effects amongst the many bad ones. As a North Easterner, we have our issues but mainland cancer like dowry and caste system doesnt have a foothold. Also, people eat whatever the F they want without fear of lynching! It is a tragedy that despite Dalits being more reformed in maharastra , they never attained political power like Dalits of UP, Bihar where Dalits have their own mainstream party.\\n\\nAll credit goes to Sharad pawar who ensure that Dalits never get mobilised. This is actually not a good measure as in reality, the figures would be much higher as many practice it but deny it Go Kerala! I\\'m a malayalee mumbaikar, I didn\\'t even know this was still a thing One interesting thing I noticed is that even though this is a per-district depiction, the trends nearly line up cleanly according to the state borders.\\n\\nThis goes to show how the standardized mini-subcultures within each state influence people\\'s values. The case of Bengal, Kerala, and Maharashtra is especially striking relative to their neighbhors. I hope there will be a time where it\\'s gone completely. Proud to see Maharashtra being a progressive in this regard. wait, that looks like South Indians are more progressive and have liberal views than North India. I am shocked at Haryana. I thought they would be higher in list. *Funny how Gujarat is still a major contributor to this even considering it is the homestate of the country* I Lepe forgetting maharashtra is above Karnataka, they don\\'t talked about much. don\\'t know when India Will be free of all these things Very happy to see kolhapur in the white Extremely surprised to see Jains had the highest \"Yes\" percentage at 35%. I\\'ve generally considered Jains to be relatively socially forward but I guess I\\'ve been living in a liberal bubble. This is honestly very disappointing. It\\'s 2020 now, and the practice of untouchability is still prevalent? Honestly, by now you\\'d thin the education system would have worked at least a little. Growing up in MP, I lived in the decently sized city of Jabalpur. My dad was a police officer back when we were in India, and he got posted to a police station out in a village somewhere. The place was about an hour drive, so we used to go there on weekends or when we didn\\'t feel like going to school.\\n\\nThis one time, during summer vacation, we were there for maybe 3 weeks. My brother and I used to go out and play in the fields or whatever all day long. This one time him, a few other friends, and I were playing around where we got our feel all covered in mud. After we were done, before we going home we decided to stop at this hand pump to wash out feet. We waited while this outer kid, around our age, was filling up about 3 matkas with water. He filled them all up, and left with 2 of them and said he\\'ll be right back. While he was gone, I decided to wash my feet (his 3rd matka was out of the way). He comes back, see\\'s me washing my feel, and gets pissed the fuck off. He doesn\\'t say anything to me (since my father was the police incharge of the area), but he did say something to one of our friends in a Hindi dielect I didn\\'t understand and then he threw out all the water from the matka. Confused, I asked my friend what was going on? He said this guys is from some higher caste, and they don\\'t drink or eat anything that has come into contact with someone from a lower cast. I said I\\'m not even Hindu, I\\'m Sikh. He said since he doesn\\'t know your caste, he\\'s treating you as a lower caste and will refill the water.\\n\\nThat\\'s when I realized shit like untouchability and caste system is still alive and well in India. An obvious and visible form of untouchability would be less harmful than invisible form where higher casts do not show they are treating lower cast people in an inferior manner but just not include  them in daily activities. Pleasantly surprised seeing Maharashtra stand alone seeing surrounded by a sea of red.\\n\\nAlso surprised it\\'s not all white in Kerala. Have heard of pockets in Kasargod area that drops into Karnataka. Work needs to be done.\\n\\nExtremely shocked seeing TN though. Source is from University of Maryland. Are there any citations for this research? Vegetarianism is directly proportional to Caste system if we go by this chart Anyone surprised by Gujrat being in same category as UP, Bihar? Not me. Just curious, why is the North always kinda backwards? I guess it takes a long time for people to break traditional bigotry like it does racism, generations. How is this measured? How do they collect data for this one? By asking people ? Source ? Telangana isn\\'t quite there yet but hey, we\\'re getting there.. some progress is better than no progress Nagaland? Really ? Which year or when was it conducted? As expected from Amiths Maharashtra looking so fair and lovely, but my home state odisha makes me sad end classism If you see south indians and west Indians are very intelligent Bengal has a lot of bad things but on this one it doesn\\'t disappoint much , I\\'m curious about South Bengal because personally I haven\\'t heard about it. Proud to be from Kerala!!! Cow belt ftw The cow-belt is clearly visbile here.\\n\\n\\nApparently making people eating beef will ensure they don\\'t practice untouchability :)\\n\\nIt would also improve their literacy & give the people brains to elect better leaders.\\n\\n/s Proud to be a Maratha Can someone overlay the 2019 election result over this map ? How old is this? Telangana\\'s borders aren\\'t on this map. Feeling Ashamed from Himachal Pradesh. I belong to the western part, Dharamshala. But the sad thing is that  so called modern areas like Shimla, Manali and Mandi are dark. It\\'s always interesting seeing the correlation between bigotry and distance from the coast. proud of my state(Maharashtra) ^_^ As you go south , Indians get wiser . Marathi people have strong character. Well proud to be from state of Maharashtra. Land of Reformers. Shivaji Maharaj, Mahatama Jyotirao Phule, Savatri  Phule, Gokhale, ....... its huge.\\n\\nShahu Maharaj a prominent King(1874-1920) and more a reformer who setup different boarding school for different community. Abolished Mahar act, appointed non brahmin for Vedic  education, Supported Dr ambedkar during his struggling period. Free education to all during his regime. Shahu Maharaj arranged intercaste marriage of his sister  **Chandraprabhabai.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThese all contributed greatly towards decreasing of untouchablilty in Maharashtra. Ah, MP is the hidden thug, often outshined by classic thugs like UP & Bihar, thanks to their massive population. \\n\\nApart from less population density, MP is just another UP-Bihar,  it’s poor (gdp per capita: India ~$1,900, MP- $1,300, UP- $1000, Bihar - $900), has lower average literacy - 69% (2011) and it’s casteist and belongs to cow belt.\\n\\nEdit; Cow belt aside Odisha & Assam have higher untouchablity practices in districts with high tribal populations (southern Odisha & eastern Assam). Is it a coincidence that all red marked states are mostly under BJP government? Look at the cow belt Nagaland? Are you kidding? First of all, we don\\'t even have a caste system. Second of all, the indigenous people of the state mainly practice Christianity and untouchability has its roots in the Hindu caste system. I\\'m not really sure but besides Christianity, I suppose people in some of the far-flung places worship nature, so there\\'s that.\\n\\nBut even then, if there is any validity to this data, I can vouch for the fact that this isn\\'t because of the indigenous people. It is probably because of the migrants from other parts of India that\\'s causing this. I haven\\'t been much to Maharastra in my life. Any good reasons why it\\'s so progressive in this metric? The caste system is here to stay so long as people feel proud about having born into their respective caste. Kerala Gang Rise Up My state is in a very dire state Telangana isn\\'t quite there yet but hey, we\\'re getting there.. some progress is better than no progress Very true and disappointing. It is so bad that a majority of people have accepted it the way it is. But there\\'s hope from folks like we have in this community. dated? Can you provide link of this survey ? I just want to share it with other guys. Is this for 2019? How did theh even collect the Data Very disappointing picture, the middle horizontal strip area of India is still suffering with this problem. I believe educated has to play a great role to eradicate this menace. These data are chocking for everyone, a lot of work still needed This is a ten year old dataset Op, can you give us some insight on the questions asked in that survey? This just makes the case, north India is the shitty part How was this data collected any link to the source ? [deleted] The fact that the cow belt is not just red color is a victory, cannot expect any more.., How are such data ever gathered? \\n\\nI am genuinely curious. This is depressing. How about some religious artwork to cheer ppl up Surprised Telugu states are on the lighter side. I wonder how the data would look for the age below 30 Could very well be BJP rules states map. \\n\\nOh wait. To be honest, I\\'ve never seen untouchability in Punjab. Awful seeing this. [removed] People commenting on north/south india, casually ignoring north-east..as usual Meanwhile my parents rejecting an arranged marriage proposal where the girl is from untouchable class.

And all the cow belt states are dragging India behind... #Gutkha-khods Interesting to see Punjab that low. Sikhism? Peasants and their problems West Bengal :-) North India still stuck in the stone age, while South focuses on education and development. if you notice it\\'s the north side :pwe southerners are humble people lul Would be interesting to see the data for literacy rate and per capital along with this I don\\'t understand why North India is so backward. South Is way better in almost everything. Can you explain what it means to an American Sikh? Goddamn I’m proud of Kerala! Non-Indian here, isn\\'t untouchability prohibited by the Constitution? I though this bs died put long ago Would someone be kind enough to ELI5 the “Practice of Untouchability” in India for a foreigner coming in from r/all? me: * a north indian *\\n\\nalso me: those goddamn north indians 😤 mera bharat mahan Which year\\'s data is this ? What is untouchability? Wow! We as a country Can\\'t grow unless we get united. What does Household Practicing mean? That untouchability is practiced in households?? In brazil we just call them poor people jai jai maharashtra maza [deleted] wtf is Gujrat and Rajasthan doing? Hey American here. I’ve had classes on the class systems of India but am by far no expert and those were years ago. Was wondering if someone could explain this and if it still has to do with traditional ideals or if there is a different drive for it in present times? Any answers are appreciated. India world power 2020, biggest joke of the year Just by looking at the map, it doesn\\'t seem to correlate with economic progress. I\\'m very keen to know what other metrics they can do stats with. That\\'s the worst thing we are continuing in India. Okay. I find this hard to believe. It could be the ratio of people that believe in the caste system, but who even practices untouchability still? So crazy, as a westerner who visited India last year I had no clue this was still happening. Its so hard to pick up on all of the nuances and I guess many tourists just boil it all down to \\'crazy shit everywhere\\' and \\'chaos\\' haha.\\n\\n Quite sad to see that still takes place. This is shocking... when will the people learn. What is untouchability?? Hope it\\'s more white now since the data has to be atleast 5 years old as telengana is not shown as a state . Himachal has high literacy rate and hight untouchability. 👏 Cow belt being cow belt doing gobar practices As a Tamilan, I feel ashamed. Almighty will free whole the country from Untouchability in India!! Sab Changa Si, can you free India from Untouchability si??? This doesn\\'t seem right¿\\nGiven its done by University of Maryland, I\\'m sure there wasn\\'t groundwork done and a lot of assumptions were made This might also be kind of mis represented. as it just looks at households. But if someone is homeless, living on the streets, can still be facing untouchability. But in just the context of how certain states don\\'t practice untouchability within people who can afford houses. What year is this report mate? Indore has zero untouchability practice. I am shocked, why does himachal has high percentage? കേരളം Quite surprised to see the data on Maharashtra especially given the Manuwadi RSS operates out of there. When was this data made ? If its an old one then definitely the numbers change will due to the rise of hindutva I don\\'t believe this... Pretty sure the conclusion is based on very limited test cases I wonder how good this data is and what sample of people have been surveyed? This looks so flawed that i cannot even fathom the sheeple and ignorance on this subreddit. For example the darkest region is delhi and 50% of them practice untouchability. wake up sheeple - have you ever been to delhi??? Have you even heard of untouchability in delhi ? it is the most metropolitan city you will ever see . In buses the problem is over crowding and everyone touching eachother and not the other way around.\\n\\nYou are being pawned - use your brain for god sake. Do not think this is correct picture especially for Gujarat. Spent close to two decades there, never encountered untouchability. Castesism yes but no untouchability. I wouldn\\'t trust the data. Link to the source would really help to validate the authenticity of the work. Can anyone provide link for this? I\\'m from doon i never seen anyone practicing this I\\'m American what is untouchability? Proud to be a south indian!! Another L for India A headsup, this dataset had been published in Year 2011-12. So data collected is almost a decade old. Wtf is untouchability.

Many persons who wore masks in the community did not use N-95 or similar highly efficient filtration devices, which have been recommended for use in the hospital setting. \\n\\n- CNN article - https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/01/asia/coronavirus-mask-messaging-intl-hnk/index.html I started reading books, sitting at home during quarantine Can\\'t upvote twice :( Absolutely brilliant!!

I would recommend you to book 3AC tickets.\\n\\nEdit: You can book tickets 1 day before train's departure day under Tatkal quota too but it's risky and its costs extra money. Tickets can be sold out in under 5 minutes after it opens. You will get tickets easily even in Tatkal a day before while you are travelling Kanpur to Varanasi and Varanasi to Kolkata. \\nI always used to take tickets a day before while I was living in Kolkata and coming to Varanasi my hometown. \\n\\nOne of my friend used to stay in Kanpur and I often used to visit it in the same manner. .\\n\\nIf nothing is planned and you want a flexible journey, then you can do tickets a day before but be a little cautious and do it as soon as ticket booking opens, which is 10 a.m for A.c class and 11 a.m for sleeper class.

If someone is protesting peacefully against injustice they have every right I understand and empathize with your perspective. However, if you want the protest to end, that means you are okay with giving up the only resistance there exists against the CAA. Without the protests (and essentially no one being outraged), the Act gets implemented silently and obediently, and you are at the mercy of this genocidal government. You are okay with atrocities being committed against people of your religion and possibly you yourself. There is literally no other fight available to people right now other than peaceful protesting, even if it may eventually lead to nothing. At least it keeps international media attention on India and possibly reduces the damage inflicted on Muslims or postpones it. Unless you have a better alternative than protesting.\\n\\nIf you are okay with protesting, but not in Shaheen Bagh because it makes your life more difficult, and would rather that the protests moved elsewhere in a different locality, your argument is selfish, albeit valid, but undoubtedly selfish. And there's no merit in that for me, sorry. You would rather that someone else gets inconvenienced and threatened, and while of course that may be a natural reaction, it is not very endearing. No, OP. \\n\\nDo you think that if all protests end , the hatred will stop? \\n\\nNo. \\n\\nDo you know what bjp's no. 1 weapon is? \\n\\nIt is hate. Hate will always exist in people's hearts unless these hindutva goons sitting in the Centre are thrown. We need everyone in our country to realise that hateful hyper nationalism is very bad. Oppression is very bad. \\n\\n\\nAnd it is only achievable through protests. Times are hard now but trust me when I say that this protest is the only reason people have hope right now. They already had the chronology planned they always had the plan to attack the minorities. We all know what they wanted. But the protest made a revolt against them and people not only from minorities but also the majority of Hindu’s started joining. This protest is not between Hindu and muslims. Its a protest of the educated vs the oppressor. They want you to go weak and they will land the first blow. But they cant take away the hope and the unity of the people because religion comes after humanity. You can be a muslim or a hindu but firstly we’re an Indian and we learnt to respect all the religions. I understand your opinion and perspective but I have a question for you. Would you also advice women in your house to cooperate with the rapist to reduce the pain in case someone attacks them? We've seen similar events play out in Indian history multiple times. But just taking events which have been done by the duo at the helm of the country right now:\\n\\n* If Gujarat is any indication, there might be pogroms in the future for Muslims followed by segregated housing (similar to Ahmedabad).\\n\\n* If Assam is any indication, the NRC process will be brutal, imprecise and disproportionately affect poor people.\\n\\n* If the Kashmiri Pandit exodus/genocide is any indication, the (current) ruling party is willing to just keep using some token crowd as a political prop to suit its agenda without actually doing anything for them.\\n\\n* If modern Kashmir is any indication, the government is willing cut off basic necessities (e.g. internet) for months just to enforce their police state, jail people without reason etc.\\n\\n* If the demonetization is any indication, the government is willing to put its own citizens at huge risk just to win an election (UP election) and on the basis of some tinpot economics.\\n\\nIf you look at other events in Indian history (Sikh riots, Kashmiri Pandit exodus, Mumbai riots of 1993, 1983 Nellie massacre) we can see the patterns emerge here as well.\\n\\nWe've seen such events play out elsewhere in the world too. India is not unique in this respect.\\n\\nThe NRC-CAA process preceded by a pogrom? Your documents will burn in your houses and then you'll be forced to somehow produce those documents to prove your citizenship. It'll leave a lot of casualties - and now only the non-Muslims will get citizenship back through CAA. You go to a 'detention' camp.\\n\\nThis is an existential crisis for Muslims so I'm not surprised that they are taking to the streets...\\n\\nLet's not forget this\\n\\n> First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—\\n         Because I was not a socialist.\\n\\n> Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—\\n> Because I was not a trade unionist.\\n\\n> Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—\\n         Because I was not a Jew.\\n\\n> Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.\\n\\n> -Martin Niemoller You have put into words what I have been feeling for the longest time.

People bring supplies such as food and sleeping bags to stay for long periods of time.\\n\\nRelay protests are much more likely to attract media attention without disrupting peace and order.

The majority of the state is non-vegetarian. It has an incredibly developed Non-vegetarian cuisine. Ask anyone outside the south about the perception of Tamilians and its always vegetarian. Majority of the reason is because outside the state the vast majority of Tamilians working are Brahmins (especially in civil service), and most of the eateries outside the state are run by Brahmins. For those that don’t know, this is Dalit cuisine\\n\\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/homegrown.co.in/amp/article/803216/dalit-identity-and-food-memories-of-trauma-on-a-plate\\n\\nhttps://popula.com/2018/11/20/there-is-no-dalit-cuisine/\\n\\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.livemint.com/Leisure/wJzDhGEE4csaX2BjhjHMsL/A-story-of-culinary-apartheid.html%3ffacet=amp\\n\\nWould you eat this? Perhaps if you were starving and nothing else was available to you? That is why these people started eating them! [removed] I’m not telling everyone to eat non-veg, beef or pork. I know the last two are unfathomable for most of us. However, those that want to eat them should have no restrictions. There never used to be any such laws before and this was the traditional diet of many communities Gai doodh nahi deti hai, hum usse le lete hai. Spot on. It\\'s not like we are an animal or nature-loving society otherwise. It\\'s all caste, masquerading as lifestyle choices. I belong to small backwards village in UP where we didn’t have electricity until a few years ago\\n\\nOutside our village was a basti of the Chamars\\n\\nThey certainly did not eat lithi chokha unless it was given to them as leftovers. All they were entitled to eat was the leftovers of higher castes and they used to take the joothan of both Hindus and Muslims without discrimination. I am haunted by a moment when I was around 10 years old and ran after the ice cream cycle and bought an ice cream and I was greedily eating it like a pig while a boy the same age as me but from the Chamar community was staring at the ice cream and at me and I still remember the look on his father’s face. His father wanted to buy one for his son as well and went after the ice cream man. My mother told me to eat it away from them so that they cannot see and ‘najar nahi lagegi’ \\n\\nThey ate pig and breed them and would sacrifice a pig every year to their caste god. They also ate the flesh of all dead animals. They ate lizards, jackals, mongoose I don\\'t get the cow fascination most cows are domesticated so they grow up for sole purpose of feeding milk to the population so why get offended when people eat it I mean the cow served same purpose in both cases to feed people, I will never get the cow thing it\\'s so stupid. \\nMy great grandfather(Brahmin) moved to West Bengal and since then most of our family members are non vegetarians but still beef is very sensitive topic. I hope someday we can see through this bs it\\'s a domesticated animal people stop getting offended. I am sorry but you are using the words \"Indian\" and \"caste\" very vaguely. I am an upper caste Brahmin from the Bengal originally and there is no such restriction for any caste. In fact even the \"pujari\" eats non veg after doing puja, in fact he is fed before everyone else can eat. Also, same is the case in kashmiri shaivism and a lot of other tantric sects as well. \\n\\nIt is only a few \"elitist\" brahmins (mostly vaishnavites). Who promote such ideas and should be looked down upon because they spoil the name of Hinduism. We are a very vast culture with many schools of thought we can\\'t demean Hinduism entirely just because a part of it is very casteist. We need to learn, re-write and re-narrate Hinduism to the masses.\\n\\nThere is a lot of hindutva propaganda. But let\\'s try to see though it and not kill beef eaters or look down upon meat eaters. \\n\\nPS: I did upvote because you started a great convo here. We need more and more diverse voices Just like everything else in india Such hypocrisy is ripe in India and I personally feel there is a need for drastic change that would make the society casteless and classless may be I’m wrong but it’s time for a change in mindset of people. Of course most people in this country don\\'t actually care about animals. We all see and ignore the plight of street animals every single day. By that argument are Jains and Bhuddists also forcing vegetarianism ? Or is it only the Brahmins who are espousing vegetarianism on everyone. \\n\\nKshatriyas were warriors and kings. They ate meat. So to say vegetarianism has to do a lot with casteism is being a bit dishonest. \\n\\nIndian cuisine is one of the few which organically has so much vegetarian food choices instead of just meat substitutes. It is sad that even that is used to fuel hatred on this sub. \\n\\nHope you find peace OP. What is this? Bootleg scroll article? This write up is sprinkled with gems like,\\n\\n>Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power **being forced on** the non-vegetarian majority – **with their consent**.\\n\\nDa fuq.\\n\\nAnother gem,\\n\\n>The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.\\n\\nHmm what?? Why is this nonsense just there right in the middle without any preface and conclusion?\\n\\nAnd wonderful theorem proving techniques. To prove,\\n\\n>**Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals**\\n\\nGoes on to assume the same thing,\\n\\n>The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity.\\n\\n*Proof:* Assume theorem is true => Theorem is true now. Done<>\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThere are many things wrong with caste, but vegetarianism isn\\'t one of them. So vegetarianism is bad because of Brahmins? I feel nowadays caste based vegetarianism is like forced practice I have friends who belong to the swami caste yet they eat meat and stuff outside in secret and practice vegetarianism at home. This is pure BS.  \\n\\nPeople are non vegetarian because that comes naturally to them and easily accessible. In today\\'s world we don\\'t even need to rely on meat as we can get majority of required supplements with veg counterparts and remaining can be found in eggs. Most Baniyas/Vaishyas are vegetarian. Kshatriyas have a high percentage of meat eaters. Any “ism” is more about moral superiority than the real thing. Absolutely. We\\'re a hypocritical bunch with dung for brains. If we had the sense to look beyond Brahmin India, we\\'d see how people thrive with non-vegetarian food in their diets. It\\'s beyond cringe to see our athletes against say, Australian or New Zealand athletes. When we moved to the UK initially we had the problem of halal haram coming from a Muslim family but later we decided to abandon these customs for a few reasons:\\n\\n1. In this country you cannot see the animal being slaughtered, so you do not really know if it is halal and since most of the animals are stunned beforehand, it so not valid. Thus you cannot be sure of the provenance of meat even if it is from a halal animal\\n\\n2. It is not convenient to be restricted to certain foods. We lived in a White British area and not some Desi ghetto where everything is halal or vegetarian. Most of the things I grew to like actually consumed pork such as sausages, pate,  etc. Which either my parents knew had pork but did not care or they really didn’t know\\n\\n3. Islamophobia and also the mentality of most Muslims in modern times makes me want to distance myself from them\\n\\n4. Me and my father, mother are technically atheist or agnostic, so why not eat pork?\\n\\n5. I used to try to be vegetarian as far as possible but I love meat too much so it didn’t last long I\\'m an avid non vegetarian. I don\\'t crave pork or mutton coz i much rather prefer the chicken-egg-fish combo.\\n\\nIf you have to bring it up to castes well even among the so called brahmins there are sub casts and I happen to belong to top of them. And in my entire region, across casts and whatever subsections you want to indulge in or care for, having the ability to have fish regularly is among the top prosperous blessings our ever so orthodox ancestors can bestow upon us.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s easier to chalk it up to caste. The choice and stigma of vegetarianism is more about the region and the kind of people who\\'ve rose to power in those regions from ancient times. But most of it lies with people who cling to unfounded beliefs in the name of \"culture\" and not having the sense or ability to question why things are so.\\n\\nPS: pretty much any class of people have had access to and have consumed some section of non vegetarian food. Just go through the manuscripts from the courts of any kings and such you can get your hands on. Bengali brahmins eats fish. It has nothing to do with caste but everything to do with religion. Naturally some random beliefs might get right. Definitely nothing to do with compassion for animals either. BS ->\\n>As is common knowledge, \\n\\nCommon knowledge is WRONG, all the time, not most of the times, all the times. \\n\\n\\n>the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet\\n\\nWrong again, the mostly part is wrong as well as the entire sentence \\n\\n\\n\\n>, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously\\n\\nWho told you? \\n\\n\\n\\n>is much higher than among those who are not from these communities\\n\\nThis proves nothing and helps in NO WAY to make the point you are trying to make. \\n\\n\\n\\n> The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians\\n\\nThis proves nothing, and you have no data to proof this, and you have not even defined the higher and lower. Your ranking of higher and lower is based upon an argument you tried to make before, which makes your assertion circular, ergo no signal but noise. \\n\\n\\n> burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.\\n\\nWho told you?  It is not a burden but a choice. Just because you cannot accept other women\\'s choices does not mean your labelling of their choice as burden is correct. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>of moral power of minority within Hindus\\n\\nWrong again\\n\\n> be if they feel threatened by the introduction\\n\\nCircular argument again, it\\'s their choice, and it their right to protest. It is their right to PROTEST AGAINST THE THINGS THEY DO NOT LIKE. just because you do not like their rights and choices does not mean you are correct. Do not poke your nose into other\\'s people choices and rights. \\n\\n> In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung\\n\\nOne who eats beef by slaughtering underage calf is NOT the same as one who eats beef of buffallows. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above write up a anti semitic and calls for voliance upon bhramins, just like the naxzis do and continue to do so. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe tax paying citizen [ net + ve tax paying [ no reservation, no govt aided college and medicare ] ] is an asset, not a libilaity. [removed] Ambedkar also wrote about it in one of his books To clarify I am not against vegetarianism itself, it is actually a good thing but it is not good to force it upon poor Indians who have historically suffered great injustices and many still do. If you can afford to chose what you want to eat, that’s great but remember not everyone is able to chose. very true Unfortunately, in Hinduism, certain animals are considered more valuable than certain categories of humans. gohatya or slaughter of cows is a grave sin, perhaps only superseded by brahmahatya  or killing of Brahmins. Why are you replying to your own post.You can edit it. They say that non veg makes your mind dull (which is complete bs btw), to them, I say, Einstein and Newton weren\\'t vegetarians.. I agree with your heading. In India vegetarianism is like that. But you are going too much extreme on other side and getting preachy . Let people eat whatever they want. This post reminds me of the L. K. Advani interview with his wife, where she blurted out that his favourite food was chicken hearing this Advani was visibly perturbed/embarassed and negging her to shut up. > \"People who committed big sins in past life, have been forbidden to enjoy tasty (non-veg) food in this life\"\\n\\nI use this to shut down any vegetarian who pretends to be morally superior as I much on my chicken/fish/beef/pork :) Bang on!\\n\\nYou forgot the main aspect that connects the caste system and diet - untouchability! \\n\\nI get people getting nauseated due to the smell. But there\\'s whole different untouchability I have witnessed where the vegetarians don\\'t want people eating non veg on same table to touch their food or even use same spoons. As if some minute particles of non veg are gonna spoil their purity.\\n\\nAnd another mistake we do is restricting this discussion to Brahmins. The Jains are vociferously pungent about non vegetarians. Most of the shit non vegetarians receive comes from them! I sometimes wonder how every discussion somehow excludes the nasty practices of that community. I felt very much in two minds when I visited India as a vegetarian (vegetarian for ethical reasons). I was of course absolutely delighted to have so many options when it came to food, and it never felt like the food I had was prepared as an afterthought. In Western countries, you\\'re sometimes lucky if there is one vegetarian option on a restaurant\\'s menu, and that itself will often be \"Please ask your waiter\". This roughly translate as \"Ask us, and we\\'ll go through the back of the fridge and maybe the peels from yesterday, fry up what we find, throw some soy sauce over it and sell it to you as stir-fry for €20\". So having so many choices and such delicious options was a fantastic experience for me.\\n\\nHowever, when I chatted with my colleagues while there, I had more than one of them mention to me how some of their family members would use their vegetarianism almost like a weapon. One told me that he and his wife were no longer vegetarian, and consequently her parents had cut contact for years. Even after they had re-established contact, they would not set foot into the non-veg couples house for a long time. They now do come and visit, but the couple have to \"cleanse\" the house before the parents arrive, to make sure that there is no meat in the house at all. Not even powdered chicken stock. And no eggs in the fridge, either.\\n\\nAnother told me that an aunt of hers, when going out with the rest of the family to eat at a restaurant, will bring her own food. And she\\'s only started doing that after not having had a meal with her family for years.\\n\\nIt really made me sad to hear about all this. Sharing food is such an important aspect of companionship, family and culture, and to break that so callously and brutally is beyond my comprehension. I really appreciate this post. It actually came up recently in another thread I was in. I like that you wrote this without criticising any one section. Vegetarianism in India is one of the great plagues forced upon the masses. If we could eat beef and pork and other meat then we would never go hungry. The Chinese eat everything, learn from them. They have survived some of the worst famines in history yet they are thriving PETA, celebrities and Westerners need to stop endorsing vegetarianism (and even worse, veganism) in a developing 3rd world country where most of the people suffer from hunger. It makes me sick when Westerners praise Indians for their non-violent vegetarianism. Sure, Indians can’t hurt cows but they have no issue lynching a human that supposedly ate one Fantastic points put forward. Vegetarianism is form of elitist thinking and lifestyle and it\\'s also repressive. Live and let live, and let people eat what they want ffs. Ugh!\\nAnd the virtue signaling in social media.\\nEvery single time when there is a forest fire, this same group couldn\\'t stop posting about meat industry\\'s 3% contribution to global warming.\\n\\nI\\'m like.. \\nYeah? The forests stop burning if malnutrition becomes the global standard?\\n\\nYou don\\'t eat meat because of your fucking scriptures you idiot, don\\'t pretend like you care about the planet.\\n\\nThe same people do not care about anything else that is happening in India! [deleted] If you replace that vegetarianism with English language in India and non vegetarianism with the desi languages we will reach the same conclusion , the thing is poor people always follow the rich people not the other way around Root cause is not caste hierarchy. Root cause is some principle behind a caste not wanting to consume meat. It\\'s a stupid argument, comparing caste hierarchy to love for animals. You should rather compare the reason why certain castes want to follow vegetarianism. I wonder when people of kolkata are forced to try Jain/Marwadi Veg food Are you against animal agriculture or for it? I would like to make a new post now because at this point there are too many comments to reply individually so apologies for this. Also thanks for the silver!\\n\\nOk so title states that Indian vegetarianism has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals. That does not mean caste system is the reason for vegetarianism. I apologise if at any time I made it appear that way. Religion, region and availability of ingredients as well as economics are also very important factors \\n\\nI also apologise for hurting sentiments of anyone, in no way do I mock anyone for holding cow sacred, but the truth is that cows in India are sadly not thriving, most as seen on the road side are actually struggling to survive. We can argue that at least they are free unlike other countries where they are kept in poor welfare farms and abused for meat and dairy etc.\\n\\nI am not against any community or caste, I am merely against discrimination, a lot of which is so deeply rooted in our society that we have been blinded to a large extent. I believe people should be able to eat what they want\\n\\nThe reason I posted parts of this article from 2017 is because it is still valid and the whole thing has some unnecessary details, otherwise I could have just posted a link to the original. I elaborated my own views and opinion in the comments \\n\\nAs we can see society is changing and attitudes, not always for the better unfortunately \\n\\nBeing Vegetarian is good but eating meat is not bad. Yes vegetarianism nowadays will benefit the environment but it not be forced on anyone. The poorest of the poor should have the right a balanced proper diet. They have historically eaten meat so it is unfair to take that away from them as well and advocate them to eat plant based substitutes, so much has already been taken away from them.\\n\\nPeace and prosperity \\n\\nBharat mata ki jai! Can anyone tell why specifically cow was chosen to be revered and not buffalo? I don\\'t think this is a sound model considering that the fraction of meat eaters don\\'t follow the caste hierarchy, I mean if Caste Hierarchy is Brahmins > Kshatriyas > Vaishyas > Shudras, then going by your explanation the fraction of meat eaters should be in the order of Shudras > Vaishyas > Kshatriyas > Brahmins, but it\\'s more like Shudras > Kshatriyas > Brahmins > Vaishyas. I have seen a lower number of Baniya caste people who are non-vegetarians as compared to Brahmins.\\n\\nPlus eating meat is more like function of how religious someone is (if meat eating is forbidden in the version of religion in their region), behavioral inertia, and economic situation. Expanding on the last one, Dalits of my village are pretty well to do, I mean you wouldn\\'t notice when you enter lower caste neighborhood, so eating meat for them is not a matter of survival, and behavioral inertia and religious beliefs take over.    \\n\\nAlso I don\\'t think we should be discussing this, because it is implicitly persuading people to eat meat. Currently nearly all meat is industrially produced which results in great suffering for the animals involved, is bad for health and have massive environmental impact. Beef is worst of all, especially the cattle reared solely for slaughter. \\n\\nA cow needs to be fed 20+ tons of food and even greater amount of water before it\\'s ready for slaughter in two years, in the meantime it has produced 10s of tons of methane and carbon dioxide. Then you kill it to obtain a few hundred kilograms of meat. This is horrible conversion ratio of resources.  \\n\\nWe have raised cattle for generations, so take it from me that you need at least half acre land to support one cow. Now on one hand you ear mark half acre for two years and then you will get say 300 kg of meat, or you could grow 8 different crops in the meantime which will give you much greater amount of food products, and capture some CO2 in the meantime. I don’t see it as such a problem in Punjab. I suppose it’s because caste hierarchy isn’t as big of an issue as it is in other states. It’s an issue but not as prominent I think. PART 1 \\\\[PART 2 posted as a reply to PART 1\\\\]:\\n\\nFor **TLDR** scroll to the bottom of the comment (PART 2).\\n\\n\\\\-------\\n\\nVegetarianism is the natural course any civilization would follow in a country with the geographical conditions such as India\\'s. And vegetarianism as a cultural phenomenon (religion, caste, etc.) is merely a consequence.\\n\\nLet me explain this.\\n\\nWe have one of the most fertile plains in the world, created due to the the extensive river network throughout the subcontinent, the most prominent ones being the Indus river plains and the Ganga river plains (630 million acres) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic\\\\_Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic_Plain))\\n\\nFor the climate that early Indians were exposed to, the terrain and the geographical conditions they lived in, agriculture was the most optimal means to feed the society. As a side note, agriculture and relative isolation is the main reason for such explosive population. The conditions were similar for china too. (This research paper illustrates the correlation between agriculture and explosive population growth ([https://www.nature.com/articles/16339](https://www.nature.com/articles/16339))\\n\\nNow compare this with China.\\n\\nChina, like India has an extensive river network throughout the early Chinese civilization positioned on the east of Heihe-Tengchong line, where to this day, 94% of the population resides. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heihe%E2%80%93Tengchong\\\\_Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heihe%E2%80%93Tengchong_Line))\\n\\nChina also has two prominent rivers, namely, Yellow river and the Yangtze river, which led to a network of multiple fertile plains, the most prominent being northeastern Chinese plain. This is also where the earliest Chinese civilization existed ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast\\\\_China\\\\_Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_China_Plain)) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow\\\\_River\\\\_civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River_civilization))\\n\\nAgriculture, like in India, was naturally adopted in China too, given the climatic, geographical conditions of the country. This again lead to the explosive population growth in China, like in India. ([https://www.nature.com/articles/16339](https://www.nature.com/articles/16339))\\n\\nNow, let\\'s analyze the vegetarianism aspect of this situation.\\n\\nLike India, China also had a long history of vegetarianism, mainly due to the agricultural development the civilization witnessed (This later changed, people did eat \"weird $hit\"; Mongols have a significant contribution to meat eating culture in China, again, due to Mongolian geography). ([https://ivu.org/history/east/china.html](https://ivu.org/history/east/china.html)) Huan Tsang also notes that Indian upper castes were predominantly vegetarian. ([https://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Jackson9/chapter03.html](https://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Jackson9/chapter03.html))\\n\\nComparing this to non-agricultural civilizations (more appropriately, settlements and nomads) found mainly in central, western Asia, Europe and Mid-Africa, where agriculture was difficult, people resorted to meat consumption. The first meat production/culturing (NOT consumption; early Homo sapiens ate meat too but they weren\\'t civilized yet) took place in western Asia, which then spread to central Asia and Europe. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#History\\\\_of\\\\_meat\\\\_production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#History_of_meat_production))\\n\\nNot only India and China, most ancient agricultural civilizations like East (China, Japan), South East, Mediterranean basin adopted vegetarianism. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\\\\_of\\\\_vegetarianism#Ancient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_vegetarianism#Ancient))\\n\\n\\\\[END OF PART 1.

If you look at the terminology we use\\n\\nPure veg \\n\\nNon-veg\\n\\nThese are unique to India\\n\\nPure veg apparently does not even include onions and garlic and masoor dal as well as mushrooms and more. It is basically the Sattvik diet. It includes yoghurt, milk, ghee, butter. Sometimes vegan tourists mistake pure veg for vegan but that is not the case. Pure veg is for the purest castes\\n\\nNon-veg is unique to India because vegetarian is not considered the norm in other countries thus the term is not used. ‘Meat’ or protein is used instead Everything I have said is true. People downvoting my comments on this thread are either bigoted/prejudiced or content with ignorance and want to keep the lower castes oppressed [removed] I call this BS.I come from a vegetarian family, been one my whole life. Never witnessed any caste or religion based discrimination. India is too big for such broad generalizations, I can speak for North Indians (Punjabis, including Delhi) are mostly vegetarians and also the most cosmopolitan of Hindus and have the least level of discrimination based on caste, religion or race. I have second hand knowledge for rest of India, still the love, respect and acceptance of animals in India is impressive and admirable.\\n\\nWhatever the reason may be how Hindus arrived to this but Vegetarianism is the future and the way to go. Vegetarianism and respect for all lives is only increasing in the world, it is actually one of the most important strategies to manage climate change and its impact. I know about 100+ vegetarians, except for the handful religious nutjobs, nobody cares about caste or \"purity\". \\n\\nMost vegetarians do not want meat because of the eek factor, the smell or death, the whole idea of boiling dead bodies and eating flesh is insane, disgusting and most importantly extremely disturbing. \\n\\nWould you be comfortable if dog meat was introduced in schools ?', \" MoS statement: no decision until may 3rd\\n\\nPersonally UPSC is a bitch and will take the exam on 31st.\\n\\nPending interviews: I’m glad I’m done, but pre wont wait for the deferred interviews There's a 90% chance that UPSC will postpone prelims.

Follow your dreams but with right guidance!!! Really give a strong think. Is photograhy to you something serious or just a hobby? Would you like if you were doing in 24/7 instead in free time? Because there are A LOT OF people out there who are really good photographers but do it as a hobby. \\nMy point is we often mistake hobbies for careers. Photography is cut throat career and is one that entirely depends on you as an individual . If you think doing photograpy > earning money, go for it. It means you have a passion and  photography is the most important thing for you regardless of how much it pays. If not, yeah focus on something solid for earning money and upskill yourself in photograpy. It\\'s a good dream but if you want to make serious money as a photography, it\\'s VERY hard in India. Also being a professional photographer is not the same as being interested in it. The grind can make you start hating it tbh. I honestly would say stick to a career where you can make money and keep photography on the side. Spend at least 4-5 years as an ametuer and see if you still enjoy. Use the money you earn to get better gear. Imo professional photography nowadays depends on not only your own creative talent,but your ability to reach out and connect to people. In other words get out there!And  make sure to maintain a good portfolio.Oh and also patience,lots and lots of patience.\\n\\nAnd no,you do not need a degree of any sorts(Many good photographers are self taught).

If it sounds malicious and threatening then yeah, it's a problem. If not, then you've got issues(you're at best slightly anti-social and probably an introvert) and you're seeing too much into it.

The rest were just in in to clear the exams.\\n\\nIMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country\\'s education is the contents of the text books it\\'s home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those \"guides\" are so bad it\\'s not even funny. \\n\\nThis problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don\\'t understand what they\\'re teaching. I got into several arguments about my scores being docked because i\\'d solved something by actually thinking instead of using what was in the \"book\".  Very well written!\\n\\nIMO, the good faculties are on the look out for good PhD students and good PhD students are on the look out for good faculties. Currently, it is hard to find either in India. As OP mentions,\\n\\n> The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation.\\n\\nFrom the Computer Science and Engineering perspective, there are two sides to this. In general, a student who has the capacity to do a good PhD is likely capable of working in a good corporate company. Say a good student gets a job which pays ~7lpa. If he/she stays in the industry for 5 years, this would definitely (atleast) double. One can lead a good decently luxurious life with this sort of income. Now come to the Indian PhD student. He/she earns 3.36lpa + travel + book grants, for 5 years (it is not common to have raises for a PhD student). What follows is obvious.\\n\\nNow one could argue that a student who is actually interested in research should not bother about money. But hell, the student also has a life outside research and needs to have some savings for the future! It is not easy to find jobs in India which require PhDs and do justice to them.\\n\\nNow without good students, it becomes difficult for good faculties to \\'want\\' to stay in the country. This can, again, be fixed by increasing compensation and freedom for the faculties. \\n\\nWe need to take lessons from Israel. A country as big as Mizoram, has 9 universities, around 6 of them being in the top 100 universities of the world. Even though I do not trust world rankings too much, it is sufficient enough to believe that their 6th will be as good as our best. How did they manage this? I am not sure, but I do not think nationalism has played too much of a role. It is probably due setting up the best infrastructure, inviting the best researchers, giving them sufficient compensation and a lot of academic freedom.\\n\\n**tl; dr** Invite the best researchers, give them sufficient compensation, academic freedom. Students and quality of research will follow. Can we also use the argument in OP\\'s post to explain how so little engineering is actually done in india and how many of the \"engineering\" firms are just glorified contractors? http://408perceptions.blogspot.com/2016/08/engineering-in-inida-is-waste-of-time.html whatch this article\\n', \" Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year? I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. \\n\\nISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.\\n\\nTo develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.\\n\\nThere are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.\\n\\n [deleted] > Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology.

[deleted] To all those parents and students who called Moral Science classes a sham, this is why we needed it. Religion is an expired product that has continued to stay. It should have been eradicated or died a while back but has not. If we as species have to reach next level then we need to get over religion. Any existing religion is like Superman, did wonders on paper but doesn\\'t actually exists. “When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.”\\n\\n― Jiddu Krishnamurti\\n\\n\\nQuestioner :  Kindly give a straight reply. Does god exist, or not? Yes, or no? If yes, how best to realize him in this life?\\n\\nJK : \"If you examine very closely, you have created god. Right? In India there are about – I was told there are about 300,000 gods and more. (Laughs) You understand? Every local person has his own god.\\n\\nSo, sirs, we have created god. See the irony of it. Thought has created god and then thought worships the image which thought has created. Which is, to worship oneself and call it god. You understand all this? – the better part of you is god. Right? I wonder if you understand this. First of all, let’s be clear. Have you created god? The local gods round the corner, or the local god in Rome, or in Tirupati, or wherever, you have created them, haven’t you? You are so very uncertain, aren’t you, so frightened. If you say we have created, then you are scared stiff because you have created out of your fear that. Out of your fear you want security. Right? You want safety, you want to feel there is somebody looking after you because you are afraid. You follow? So you create that, and then worship that. Just see what you are doing! Going to Tirupati and putting all your money in the bag – do you think gods want your money? Sir, look at it all. You have nothing to offer but money, garlands, prostrations, rituals. Right? You have nothing else to offer. Have you realised the tragedy of this, sirs?\\n\\nIf you love – not god, that’s very easy to love god because it is an abstraction, it has not much meaning. But if you love, that very love is god, that very love is sacred. You won’t go outside to look for god. You understand all this, sirs!\\n\\nAnd the questioner wants to know if I believe in god. I don’t. Because god is something created by man. There is such a thing as eternity, which is to be outside of time. Right, sir? For that you must have a mind, a heart that is completely free from all the burdens of life. Right? From your vanity, your arrogance, your selfishness – you follow, sir? And we say, we are not capable of it, tell us what to do. You are back in the cycle, somebody to tell you what to do. Sir, you are in a jungle, you have to walk through it by yourself. Right? And for that you need vitality and vigour and strength. Not belief in god, in goodness – belief has no place where truth is concerned. Right?\" If you need divine  reward to do something good or you have fear if you do something bad something bad will happen I think your are a piece of shit. Just be kind to the people help them if you can and for the world sake stop protecting your religion. This post is pure gold!\\nReligion destroys humanity not build it. All cast system, racism, homophobia and misogynims have their roots in religion.\\nJust fuck religion and you\\'ll bring out the best in humans!!\\n\\nGod is like that \\'Baba\\' we use to scare kids with so they won\\'t do anything that is denied. \\\\*reads title\\\\* : Ahhh , I see you are a man of culture as well It\\'s really my imaginary friend is so much better than yours.

There was this really nice quote from MIB- \"An individual is a smart person. Perfectly capable of making his own decisions, rational etc. but crowd on the other hand is violent, easy to provoke, and has nothing but a common herd mentality.\" Now don\\'t get me wrong. I do read sometime bits and pieces of religious text which are some really well thought out philosophical texts but let us be real. There always be a motherfucker who\\'s gonna distort everything and use gullible people to support his own propaganda by exploiting their concept of belief. \\n\\nSo preach father and preach it hard. Fucking hell fuck all religions. All they have ever done is divided us, and taken advantage of by opportunistic old politicians. And our childish adults should take as much blame for that. We’re literally standing on the verge of global environmental collapse with highest levels of inequality and unemployment with a massively flawed education system and all they can talk about is their mandirs and masjids with no regard for what the future generations would go through. This. This right here!! Fuckkk all religion!!!! The bane of mankind Not just religion, any ideology that overtakes your identity as a human being is dangerous.\\n\\n\\n\\nBe it the religious wars that were fought, to the dictators who mass murdered people in keeping to their beliefs, everywhere people collectively stood behind an ideology that shadowed their human identity.\\n\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t believe in ideologies rather believe and hope that tomorrow when a mob of these a$$f##king c@@ts come to lynch you, there\\'ll be atleast one amongst them questioning what he\\'s doing and changes his mind about his beliefs.\\n\\n\\n\\nOr if you are privileged enough, you could just live in harmony, clapping and cheering, watching while these c@@ts kill themselves. /S Remove religion from schools (prayers) and we have a chance at better future I am going through same frustration bro , where are the so called foking almighty God who are immortal , or are they the ones doing this, them fok them . \\n \\nGuys tell me one benefit in believing in religion ? Does it save u from these riots ? Which is happening in the name of it .\\nDoes it make people disciplined? Then who are these goons who are Killing in the name of religion ? \\n\\nI guess it was just an fiction story written by a man , and later after centuries people started thinking it as thier past and that it was all real . Just imagine after centuries if somehow someone reads marvel comics or harry potter or any such fiction story and actually believe in them thinking it as real thing from past. \\n\\n I wish people one day no longer believes in it .

It wouldn\\'t have been a real problem if everyone minded their own bussiness. \"Nothing divides us except religion\" Are you sure about that..? 🤔 Religion is a way for humans to escape reality. It makes people feel as if they are part of something bigger. In reality they are nothing, and they cant accept that. Its way too easy to think they are part of god\\'s plan rather than a blob of hydrocarbons.\\n\\nReligion is just a theory that was believed for so long that when better theories which proved religion false came along people couldnt accept it. Wrong sub my man. Most in this sub are sensible enough to know this. Should probably post it somewhere where people are deluded. People who are using incendiary rhetoric and inciting violence to meet their agenda are not in this sub. The intricate reality of these cults are far more complex to find a universal solution(for now) than saying \"fuck all religion\" on the internet. Religions will fade away,it will take time though. Until then, it\\'s what it is. If it wasn\\'t for religion, it would be caste or nationalism....for some reason being a human isnt enough and we feel a need to form smaller communities      \\nHaven\\'t come up with what a possible solution looks like but at the least it should include critical thinking in kids and stopping religious indoctrination There is no better way to make people who have no beef in the first place hate each other to the point of committing genocide than through religion. Religion, is just a flawed philosophy. There\\'s is nothing special in it. Religion is a mental illness. Why on earth would want to associate with them? Blech. Let them kill each other and some day they’ll all be gone. https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190801-tomorrows-gods-what-is-the-future-of-religion\\n\\nRead this article. India-\\n1947- Hindu Muslim Hindu Muslim \\n2020- Hindu Muslim Hindu Muslim \\n Rest of the world fighting with coronavirus. Religion is the opium of the masses. Forget about the bloody Gods and listen to what I am telling you - Margery Tyrell A hallucinatic person said something about religion which made so much sense to me. \\n\\n\"If I don\\'t believe in my imagenary friend, why the hell should I believe in yours?\" ~ Elliot Anderson Good rant I could not agree more - my hats off to my Indian brothers and sisters in the struggle against the zealots Keep spreading the truth.  Let\\'s turn all religions into mythology again. religion was invented by smart rulers to control dumb people, and its something that\\'s sadly never going to change. when you teach a child something, the older they get the harder it is for you to change their mind, and when they have kids of their own they teach them the same thing and it becomes an amplification loop. we live in a world where people take incredible luxuries for granted because thats what we\\'re born with. the modern world allows dumb people to be loud and grab the attention of other dumb people who think the same, something that was never possible before. for god\\'s sake just look at all the anti science movements, you can calculate the speed of light using a microwave and a chocolate bar but if they don\\'t believe it it doesn\\'t exist. people who think this way dont want to know the truth, they want what they think is the truth to be the truth and when that line of thinking combines with conflicting opinions all hell breaks loose. *sorts by controversial,* *grabs popcorn* Careful not to cut yourself on all that edge. Disclaimer first: I am 100% an atheist.\\n\\nHaving said that, the problem isn\\'t religion in and of itself.\\n\\nMost religious teachings usually boil down to \\'care about others\\' and \\'be a decent person\\'. Yes, there\\'s a lot of fucked up stuff in the texts as well, not denying that. But a lot of people find comfort and strength in their beliefs, and you saying they should just let go of it because it\\'s illogical and dumb, is frankly as intolerant as religious fanatics. Religion also does not have to be at odds with science and learning. I remember asking a religion teacher in school which is correct: The Big Bang or God made the world. She told me \\'Both. The Big Bang happened, but God made it happen (obvs not something I believe, but not the point is) She also reiterated that the Bible is not literal. And she was a nun. And, as you may have heard, Einstein believed in God too. So, again, it\\'s possible for both religion and scientific knowledge to coexist.\\n\\nOrganised religion is absolutely a problem. In my transition from Roman Catholic to atheist, I had a \\'I believe in God, but not in the Church\\' phase. Religious organisations can be corrupt to the core. People twisting scriptures and teachings to suit their own agendas of hate and power are a problem. People using religion to support ignorance and prejudice that harms others (like being against the LGBTQ community, or anti vaxxers, or sects who believe medical intervention should not be allowed) are a problem. But religious people who use religion to find personal comfort, help others, and be part of a community? There is nothing wrong with that.\\n\\nYes, I still believe the world would be better off without religion, because of all of the people who exploit it and do so much harm in its name. But it is not my, or your, or anyone\\'s place to dictate to someone what they should or should not believe in if they are not harming you in any way and just living their life peacefully. Because, again, if you do this, it makes you no better than religious nuts who want to dictate how we live our lives. Amen Stop talking sense. true fuck religion Thank god I\\'m an atheist. Yes, all religions are fairy tales. Yes, no religion has any definitive proof of being true.\\n\\nBut there is one point people here are missing. Religion does give people mental peace and a purpose to live especially when things are not going their way. While it gives people a false sense of hope that makes them believe that things will get better, it does keep them resilient during tough times. People want easy answers to questions and religion gives it to them. We may be rational in thinking that we can embrace tough times by just moving forward and waiting for things to become better but others are not. They can easily get depressed and go through mental problems.\\n\\nPeople who derive pride from their religion go too far. To solve that they need to be educated and given fulfilling work. This won\\'t stop them from being religious but it will at least give them a genuine reason to be proud.\\n\\nIf you want to do away with religion you need to first solve mental health problems.\\n\\nJust my 2 cents. Exactly. And fuck nationalism. None of us chose these lives/bodies that we are living in. Neither did the person you hate, choose this life for himself\\n\\nBorders were created by us and it’s something very abstract.

Then I would like to measure several parameters gdp, income, freedom of speech, etc. \\n\\nI am really curious what the results will be. It\\'s always been a way to control people. It can be argued that it brought many people together in the good ol\\' days. The world wasn\\'t so much connected back then. Your entire life would be spent in a 10km radius where it would be rare to find someone who believes in a different imaginary being. So it brought everyone together by believing things larger than themselves.\\n\\nBut the in last century, since everyone is so connected, finding a person who believes in some other imaginary being is too easy. And that\\'s where the human group psychology acts against us and forms groups. It becomes Us vs Them. Religion is unnecessary in our society. But I don\\'t think it should be irradiated or banned.\\n\\nI think the ideal way to deal with this would be to just keep what metaphysical thing you believe in to yourself. Yes This is why THANOS was right! Wait till you hear about capitalism classism Imagine being an adult who holds faith in their omnipotent imaginary friend as described in a thrice-translated collection of oral histories collected over 1500 years ago, regarding events that happened hundreds of years before they were written down.\\n\\nYou know, the Inuit believe that the earth was created by Raven. The difference: I know ravens exist. Post this on a chintu sub and witness the dislikes Yesss fuck them. Fuck all of them. Every fucking government form I\\'ve ever filled asks for my religion. Be it university or a public sector job. I despise the idea that my belief system is somehow relevant to my performance as a student or as an employee. I make it a point to write \"n/a\" in that section, no matter what the repercussions. \\n\\nIirc once a public college even asked my caste. Ffs my caste, and no, not from reservation point of view, just under personal information. Religion is nothing but a tool to control a large number of people by the people in power or those who pretend to be the representative of the religion.\\nIt was used by hitler to justify the heinous crime even tho no sane mind would agree this level of torture for a fellow human.it was used by evangelist Christian Europeans who plundered lands of other n descredited their culture along with subjecting them to discrimination.It was used by isis fighter who were so islamic that they made burkha mandatory for all woman in their area n came with motto to defend islam but themselves raped in every village they went n even killing fellow muslims.it is now being used by the  rss n bjp to polarise the people n antagonize the whole muslim community on pretext of ages old of their own made up history n encouraging lynchings through bajrang dals ,inciting violence.it is still being used by few godmen who even with rape charges against them n property worth of 100s of crore people support them blindly n anybody even dare to criticize them is declared the enemy of the whole community. I feel you man, Im gonna start college this year and am really afraid to go to Delhi to study, all it would take is one person to accuse someone of being a Hindu or a Muslim for a bloodbath that to start that police will probably ignore I truly believe in the not too distant future that the belief of religion will be classified as a mental illness. It’s CRAZY to me that when you go back and read some of the different religious texts it’s chock full of holes and usually rely on “prophets” speaking/ having visions of *insert deity here* to get the message across. That shit sounds like textbook schizophrenia but because no one knew what that was they just accepted it as truth. Now here we are thousands of years later, millions killed in the name of religion and people STILL BELIEVE THIS BULLSHIT. A fellow atheist popping in,\\n\\nAs I\\'ve said before, if God does exist, he doesnt deserve our worship because of the unnecessary suffering this donkey allows in his name or without.

I\\'m agnostic, and dislike all religions, but this reads like it belongs to r/iamverysmart. Or r/iam14andthisisdeep Let\\'s get this straight, there are a lot of things that divide us other than religion. It is in our nature to do it. \\n\\nReligion is not bad. It\\'s believing that your religion is better than all the others, or your god is superior to the other gods is what is the problem. I am not religious and I agree with you on most points. I want to believe that the abolishment of all religions is the answer to most of the problems of humanity. But, here is a thought. What about the countries with the most non-religious people? China, Czech, UK... Can we really say they are perfect? China has 90% of people who are non-believers. Can we really say they are in a better state than us?\\n\\nReligion is a problem. But maybe the bigger problem is basic human nature which is to be selfish and divisive. Yes buddy the problem is religion. Not corruption, theft, incompetence, maladministration, colonial laws, red tape, power cuts, absence of health care, undrinkable water, no water, rabies, typhoid, malaria, dengue, PM10, unlivable cities, unsustainable cost of living, ridiculous salaries, sewage in the water, inability of the state and judicial system to catch or punish any kind of criminal at any level, all of which lead to the majority of people living in a permanent state of despair. No, the only problem is religion. Let\\'s get rid of that and everything will be perfect. Great solution. Of course you are right. Nice work. Now go cure cancer b***d.

I do not believe in this modern world commercial religion shit and have distanced myself from religion since 15 years now.\\nThe thing is, it doesn\\'t matter in India.\\nI used to live in Gurgaon, and was asked my name numerous times (even in front of my house) by random people who then started fighting(non verbal fights) with me just because its a persian name. \\nI live in Toronto now, and noone gives a shit about your religion here (unless you decide to live in Indian/pakistani/bangladeshi ghettos again).\\nThe thing is, it doesn\\'t matter what your faith or philosophy is, when the crowd of fanatics comes at your door, they will kill you. There is no reason with these people, and to be honest its more related to the wealth gap between rich and poor. The poor have rage in them, they have cell phones with cheap internet and big families with nothing to do, so in their mind, power is in numbers and force is only way to get things done.\\nSeriously fuck this society.\\nEdit:word Lol looks like somebody just figured it out No matter how peaceful your religion is, the world will never be in peace with religion in it. Religion is the most dangerous disease, weapon and mental illness in this world. The main cause behind most wars, look at world war II, Nazis were predominantly Christians.... Hated Jews for killing their Lord... Thank you for this post. r/redditmoment My opinion on religion?\\nIt was created to control the people. While watching the Hindu nationalists go insane in India this is all I can think about. We have to kill religion. Pakistani here.\\n\\nWe really are in shock over what has started happening.\\nWe send our thoughts and prayers for all of you.\\n\\nI\\'m already an athiest who promotes humanity more than anything. \\nAll religions tell you to do better to gods or entities creation first.

Religion is the biggest con ever Finally someone who makes sense. I also agree that the religion and the caste system is absolute bullshit Here is the really amazing speech from Mr.Robot questioning religion.\\n\\n\\n\"Is that what God does? He helps? Tell me, why didn\\'t God help my innocent friend who died for no reason while the guilty ran free? \\n\\nOkay. Fine. Forget the one offs. How about the countless wars declared in his name? \\n\\nOkay. Fine. Let\\'s skip the random, meaningless murder for a second, shall we? How about the racist, sexist, phobia soup we\\'ve all been drowning in because of him?\\n\\nAnd I\\'m not just talking about Jesus. I\\'m talking about all organized religion. Exclusive groups created to manage control. A dealer getting people hooked on the drug of hope. His followers, nothing but addicts who want their hit of bullshit to keep their dopamine of ignorance. \\n\\nAddicts. Afraid to believe the truth. That there\\'s no order. There\\'s no power. That all religions are just metastasizing mind worms, meant to divide us so it\\'s easier to rule us by the charlatans that wanna run us. All we are to them are paying fanboys of their poorly-written sci-fi franchise. If I don\\'t listen to my imaginary friend, why the fuck should I listen to yours? People think their worship\\'s some key to happiness. That\\'s just how he owns you. Even I\\'m not crazy enough to believe that distortion of reality. So fuck God. He\\'s not a good enough scapegoat for me.\"\\n\\n- Elliot Alderson (Mr.Robot Season 2 Episode 3) I agree.\\n\\nMy parents(Hindus) always said that I must pray to God every day and shit like that but honestly, I didn\\'t think there was any sense in that. Even in my school assemblies when everyone would vow their heads in prayer(I went to a Christian school) I would just stand there with my head up. I never felt that there was any use of prayer. Amen I\\'m 17 y/o and I am sure I can live without your fairytale. Call it bragging but I\\'m just gonna go ahead and consider myself much better than majority of adult population. I am also a vegan. I have questioned my life far and wide and I think everyone should go through the process of self evaluation. \\nPlease do it. Do it for us. The future generations. this entire thread is a huge r/redditmoment lmao Religion makes many people look at eachother as sub humans. We dont matter in the grand scheme of things but it is worth it to be good to eachother to protect the little we have. Religion causes so much pain and harm to innocent families. I don\\'t hate religious people at all. I understand WHY some people believe but its just a fact the world would be a better place without it. Even Satanists? \\n\\nhttps://thesatanictemple.com/pages/tenets Atheists are just people who admit we don\\'t know how the universe works but we believe scientists  are closer to the answers to the universe than the priests are. I\\'ve never understood the mental gymnastics some of you religious apes use to justify your beliefs. I have highly educated intelligent family members who believe in all the fucking cultural pseudoscience. \\n\\nAtheism isn\\'t a choice, it\\'s a symptom of a functioning brain. Amazing. Tell others to be open minded. Then ask them to live exactly the way you want them too. \\n\\n\\n\\nFuck you too Valid points. But my religion has helped me become a better person, treat others with respect regardless of their religion and the colour of their skin, give charity, be a productive member of the society and most of all it gives me hope.\\n\\nThe problem is not religion, its extremism. Religious people are literally patients of a brainwashing cult that has incepted \\'anti-human\\' idea and tradition in their brain All right it\\'s time to address the usual rebuttals.\\n\\n\"We need Religion for emotional and spiritual values\"\\n\\nYou can hire a therapist for emotional support and simply buy a good telescope to look at the night sky, nothing is more spiritual than gazing at a clear night sky.\\n\\n\"In 20th century more people died by Nazis and commies who were atheists\"\\n\\nNazis were not atheists, they were Christians who traditionally hated Jews (even the Protestants hate Jews, just look into Martin Luther\\'s verses). Communists were atheists but weren\\'t just entirely atheists. Its the classic saying, a communist can be an atheist but not all atheists are communist (especially proletarian dictatorship).\\n\\n\"You cannot ignore the good things that religious people do.\"\\n\\nYou can do good things without being religious, there\\'s this thing called humanity you know. \\n\\n\"Being an atheist doesn\\'t mean you\\'re a good person\"\\n\\nPrecisely the point, atheism is simply an absence of belief in a God and doesn\\'t explain anything about a person\\'s political or social inclinations. There were and are many bad atheists but unlike theist folks an atheist doesn\\'t need to defend that evil person merely because they share that one specific philosophy.\\n\\n\"You cannot just remove religion like it does nothing\"\\n\\nThat\\'s true, religion does offer many good things. But as I said earlier, you can offer all those good things without invoking an omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient God.\\n\\n\"Atheists are just too arrogant\"\\n\\nTheists claim to know the mind of the omnipotent being which created this entire universe and yet atheists are the arrogant ones... Right.\\n\\n\"Religion and atheism are incompatible\"\\n\\nNot entirely true, it depends on one\\'s definition of religion. If a religion doesn\\'t need a God as a criterion then technically you can be an atheist and be part of a religion. Again atheism only means the absence of belief in a God, nothing more nothing less. Amen I think we\\'re stuck between a fake left wing that just wants to appease minorities and a rightwing that wants to install a tyranny of the majority. When the constitution clearly wants us to put aside the religious differences and want common good for everyone, I don\\'t think, we, people are not ready yet to think in such higher terms. After all these years since we said our good byes to British, we only inherited the golden divide and rule policy to keep people invested in their religious sentiments and derive political and economic returns from them. I don\\'t see a near future where people can see through shit and have a true democracy. It\\'s sad, but it\\'s also a painful truth. Chinese are atheists and look at their treatment of Uighurs, Tibetans, Hongkong, Taiwan etc... Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people by marx Well you know what they say: religion is the opium of the masses. I personally vibe the concept of faith and I can definitely see why people would be drawn to a belief, be it imaginary or not to sustain thoughts of afterlife and a greater existence. However, I hate the concept of religion as an institution. Religion has become an institution to control and generate profits and set its own agenda. Its an archaic institution that isn’t needed in the 21st century ʻOumuamua, take me away from this planet You should check out anti-theism. Btw totally agreeing with every single letter. I couldn\\'t say it any better then this. Fuck Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and their other spin offs. YES PLEASE If you don\\'t want to accept death, that\\'s fine. Focus your efforts on achieving immortality. Decide that you will live forever or die trying.\\n\\nBut don\\'t be dumb enough to believe in something that doesn\\'t translate whatsoever to reality. Most people on here would already be atheists so there\\'s no point preaching but just want to say that the world has far more to offer than religion will have you belief and this isn\\'t some short trip in a grand journey. This *is* the grand journey. Do good without thinking of consequences and without shedding blood for any divine powers.\\n\\n If there are just gods then they would be pleased with you.\\n\\n If there are no gods then you have made the world a little better nonetheless. \\n\\nIf your gods are displeased because you didn\\'t worship and slaughter for them, then they are petty and cruel and not worthy of being called gods anyway. I can\\'t explain how similar I feel with your thoughts Amen to that Yea exactly I think India should have a religion or no religion column \\nJoin r/atheismindia Wow i have always been a closeted agnostic. Didn\\'t think there were many people in india with the same mindset. On seeing the reaction and comments here i am relieved. Hey look, an atheist on reddit! Up next, a bigot from BJP! So true\\nTake my fucking upvote. You only realized this now. Religion is the best tools for power mongers and you know it\\'s another use, yeah you guessed it right, fool the foolish flock. That\\'s the irony of religion   \\nLong long ago people settled in groups, made their own cultures, lifestyles and called it as religion to bring them closer.   \\nNow, the same religion is being used to make people apart!   \\nSad part is, many can\\'t see it. Religion is the opiate of the masses - Aristotle  maybe Religion is just some really good fiction with a very toxic fanbase I hear you. Also eloquently expressed by [Carl Sagan in The Pale Blue Dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g) Finally the post I was waiting for..\\nLooks like people are starting to realize the true evil are the religion. I am getting out of these things lately. Religion at best are just fandoms and should not be given any importance in real life situations. Fuck all Humans, worst beings on earth! I have to say I like the singing and the dancing, from whatever religion, but for the rest I completely agree. Religion imo is nothing but a **MASS CONTROL**. People do not fucking respect religion, we are fucking scared from it. Human itself is the scourge of humanity. I have seen the good and bad things religions can do to people. So I see your point but not necessarily. Couldn\\'t agree with you more! Im not that religious anyways, and you seem to have a good point. Religion is the main cause of unrest here, and if people don’t pay so much attention to it, the unrest might stop. Human...is above all religion...Lets practice humanity & co-exist in harmony & make the world  a better place I see, you are a man of ~~culture~~ intelligence as well.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'ve had my share of  participation in atheist groups on the net. Sadly most of them are filled with people who don\\'t know the difference between atheism and agnosticism. r/atheism Religion were made to bring people together in harmony, to share each other\\'s thoughts, to help others out in need of help, but lately due to sheer greed of basic human nature. Religion has become a tool to control the masses and incite hate and violence against others who don\\'t follow same ideology. nice post thanks for sharing George Carlin always had it right - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r-e2NDSTuE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r-e2NDSTuE) Everyday I\\'m constantly reminded that \\'prayers\\' are the single most useless invention of humankind. There is only one god : Time I see that you\\'re a man of logic OP. Just joined, happy to see more people with common sense :3 The only thing religion does anymore is give us more artificial reasons to divide ourselves into tribes and hate each other. Couldn\\'t agree more. Amen to that [Relevant Mr robot monologue](https://youtu.be/NCe8NUK4BjQ) Death to all fanatics! \"Hey if you read history, God is one of the leading causes of death, has been for thousands of years\" - George Carlin I hate it more than you all do. Lol. Cheers Fuck Atheism! How do you feel now? This is exactly how people with religious belief feel after reading this. [I am a athiest myself] Dude just the first 2 sentences were enough I\\'m Hindu. I chill with my gods and I am with you a 100%. It\\'s not about being from a certain religion. It\\'s about an individual\\'s willingness to not take himself so fucking seriously, sit down, and contemplate his mad life. Who else have watched Man from the Earth.. Religion is how you can trick people into giving you their life.  Religion is the tool used to exploit the masses.  \"Don\\'t worry, this life is just a test run.  Actually, the more you suffer in this life, the more god loves you- the more he can hook it up in the next life.\"  Now give me tax free money, please.  Bonus points if you slay some infidel. I have pretty strong feelings about orgasm. Maybe thats what life is about - perpetual orgasm. Religion used to bring people together back in the ancient times to a common mindset so that they can be together, trust each other and work and discover & invent new things and develop various technologies. It used to unite people for greater things. But nowadays the amount of toxicity and hate spreading through religion is immense. Religion is dividing people than brigining them together.\\nKinda ironic to its original purpose. What about Dudeism? Didn\\'t know there\\'s a sub for Indian atheists lol. I\\'m a fan of Indian atheists fb page. They call out all relegion equally, but ppl also get triggered when they oppose NRC and CAB, it amazes brahmin Bhakths don\\'t understand they are standing up agsint discrimination not standing up for a relegion\\n.\\n\\nAlso why is that our mythology of gods only ever mention animals that exists today? Why isn\\'t there a god with Dino as his vehicle? Coz they didn\\'t dig deep enough to find one and ppl who made yo these back then didn\\'t even know about pre historic animals. Think to yourself........... \"When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called a Religion.\"\\n\\nRobert M. Pirsig I love u Yeah FUCK all religions. People dying over made-up stuff: Very Clever But what currently happening in India is Fascism using Religion masks to divide people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYup. The good ol\\' \\'Divide and Conquer\\'. \"Doubt is the highest form of intelligence\" Religion should have no place in politics Here here! Thank \"**GOD**\" someone stepped up and spoken the truth, the truth which matters the most in today\\'s modern world.\\n\\nYou deserve every upvote on this post. As Geroge Carlin said the best and I quote - \"Idiots fighting trying to prove to eachother, whose imaginary friend has a bigger dick\". I’m not sure if atheism is the only way. It is a good way to focus on the grand scheme of things, but religion isn’t inherently wrong. I believe it changes are a result of technological advancement. While abandoning religion would work, ‘rebooting’ a religion could also work. I only say this because religions actually never invoke any violence. It’s the understanding of the people who practice it. Granted both are equally hard, but consider a religion such as the religious society of friends. They are a good example of how well religion can affect a society. If we educated people, and had them either further educate or cut ties with people who have immoral concepts, things would improve as well. Not shitting on your opinion. Just giving my two cents. I\\'ll just give my 2 paise:\\n\\nReligion is a meme. No, not in an Advice Animal kind of way, but if you go by the original meaning of a meme, it is an idea that compels people to propagate it. In this a meme behaves like an organism such as a virus. Thus, religion is a meme.\\n\\nAnother point to support this is that **religion does not exist without people**. Religion NEEDS people to survive, without people religion cannot exist. Therefore, people are more important than religion because people came first. Religion wholly exists in the minds of people, it is not a tangible thing.\\n\\n1 paisa more: Religion does not only mean belief in some god, IMO even Nationalism and Patriotism can be religions in their own right. Although I agree, heres a clip of [Joe Rogan talking to Physicist Brian Greene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpStPNAB7Cw) on the actual purpose of Religion. Very interesting take and I agree with him too. But most people take their religions very literally. Would you like to join the church of shrek? \"In this world, good people will do good things and bad people will do bad things, but for a good man to do bad things, it takes religion.\" I became an athiest due to a few reason but mainly because of eiliot\\'s talk on religion which stuck with me for years, I introspected on it never found a contradiction so I quit believing in my religion. There are a lot more reasons but still.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the lines he said was\\n\\n\"Religion is nothing but a poorly written sci-fi franchise that we are huge fan boys of\"\\n\\n\\n\"Why are wars fought in his name if peace is what he desires\"\\n\\n\\nThe best one\\n\\n\"God is a drug and we are the addicts.\" Amen I read a book by Jack Donovan, The Way of Men.\\n\\nIn the book he said that it\\'s man\\'s primal desire to belong to a group, to be a part of something greater than himself.\\n\\nThe teens, and young adults that you see rioting on the streets are fulfilling their desire to belong to something, to fight for something, to stand shoulder to shoulder with fellow men. Everything else is a superficial excuse to act on that instinct.\\n\\nWhen you have a large population of uneducated people devoid of critical thinking abilities, they are pretty much zombies acting on instinct and very shallow reasoning, which is evident when you hear those arsonists talk. These people are the pawns, unknowning and unpaid mercenaries of anyone smart enough to rally them. The universe is 13.7 billion years old, the earth only 4.4 billion. What was god doing during those 9 billion years. Also, when we finally get to Mars and other star systems maybe in the future, how will we get to heaven? Where is heaven? Can we go faster than the speed of light going from the other star system to go back to earth and go into heaven of hell? God is fake and made up, evolution is real  and we will all die. Eventually our planet will be unbearable for human life as we know it. Amen to this PREACH!! Op: Babe, can we smash?\\nOP’s gf: No, I’m waiting til marriage\\nOp: “Fuck all religion. It’s bullshit” You have successfully summarised the trimmings of your education, and preserved this moment in time. I’m excited for you, not many people get to develop further and then be able to point back to the moment they were so very wrong. I appreciate the effort though, as I used to believe what you have written, so it’s a clear view onto my past self. Well articulated! If I may throw you a crumb of comfort, life would be boring if we had all the answers, so in the future when you read these words again, you may wonder, as I do now, the vast learning opportunities that remain. Is this by any chance in context to the current political situation in India.\\n\\nBecause if it is then it would seem like a very irresponsible thing to project onto social media. Like an \"all lives matter\" kind of argument.\\n\\ne.g. Saying the same thing in a country where atheists are being prosecuted or where people stigmatized atheists is a noble and brave thing but saying the same thing in China would mean siding with thier current regimes inhumane persecution and rounding of of Muslims in concentration camps)\\nNot to mention feeding into thier weird obsession with Tibet and who the next Dalai lama should be.\\n\\nImagine a Pakistani saying fuck Hinduism and fuck Islam while a hindu village is burned by mullah led mobs. Blaming the oppressor doesn\\'t have to mean you blame the victim as well, and as much as you probably don\\'t mean it that way, in the current context it **seems** a lot like that.\\n\\nPS: if you\\'re going to bring in the fact that it\\'s not just Hindus attacking Muslims but the opposite as well, I\\'d want to invite you to remember it\\'s starts in the broader context of the CAA-NRC under which it\\'s fairly obvious who\\'s going to be suffering. r/atheism So I have to ask what\\'s happening in India that got this guy so riled up against religion? Glad that you\\'ve out grown religion 👍 This post is GOLD! I totally agree with you All religions are fantasy like Harry Potter but let’s be honest, not all religions are the same, some are worse than others when it comes to coexisting.  \\nSome Christians and Muslims believe every word in their fantasy book and are influenced by it to hate those who aren’t like them or are homosexuals. Have you ever tried to read and interpret what\\'s written in any religious text like the Gita? AMEN BROTHER Yes, complete agreement.  I call this anti-theism, not atheism. Religion is a tool people use to deal with living it isn’t just about death. Unfortunately we’re not pure logical being. A lot of people with emotions will turn to higher powers in any form. Sadly this message will never reach to the people who need to see this. Among them most will simply reject it. \"Religion is the husk of faith\" -Tao Te Ching Lets all realize that the universe doesn\\'t care because it cannot.  Take action based on our species and this shared planet to protect ourselves by cherishing all life around us.  Resist the animal nature or mammalian ways.  Do not overpopulate the planet assuming only humans are important.  Do not pollute and exploit based solely on your very short life span but instead think of long term life.  We are evolution and each choice brings about rewards or failures for our species.  Lets choose to share with all life and allow room because from what we can observe there is no global, universe consciousness that cares. The amount of scientific evidence for religion and flat earth theory is exactly the same. As a society, we just accept the former because it\\'s been around for so long and is \"tradition\". You forgot 30000-15000 years ago we became best freinds with wolves and they have had our backs since . They have shed more blood for us than you could imagine. Fighting off animals to protect our children and crops and domestic animals. I hate how people thank god when it was dog by our side fighting and dying with us. Damn, you went rough. Before religion there were tribes and races. People always loved to form groups for recognition and unity.Thats just the nature of us humans, removing religion will not stop violence although admitting it is very easy weapon, something else will take its place. What needs to be removed is hate and instate understanding our differences and accepting each other. Religion is to humans is what Modi is to India! I agree lol Too bad Modi doesnt feel the same way. Tbh religion fills in the gaps that makes other feel unimportant as they do not matter to the universe. You can follow a religion and my opinion of you wouldn\\'t go any lower and rather than having emotions that make you feel unimportant it can be good at times. tl;dr\\n\\nReligion is outdated. But. It fills an important role.\\n\\nWhy are we here? What\\'s next? Why did this bad thing happen to me? Look at all these people, they compete for my education, my job, my housing, my future wife... they are my enemies! Why should I not harm others?\\n\\nThere are a bunch of questions that are very hard to answer without some fundamental truth - or lacking that, something that you accept as fundamentally true. kendrick lamar once said: \"fuck your ethnicity\"\\n\\nthanks\\n\\nalso today is ash wednesday They like to say that religion brought people together. No. It united certain groups of people to become stronger than other groups of people so that they might kill and decimate them. Fuck all Religion. Yes - otherwise religion will fuck us all! Can I have an Amen...!!! Someone get this guy some Jesus in his life ASAP! Well that’s certainly one opinion Look into the church of the flying spaghetti monster.  This is the only understandable religion imo. It ain’t that bad.\\n\\nI guess it’s because religion has never been a negative thing in my life, and I’ve been lucky to be born into a country that allows me to practice what I want, in a community that is forgiving, and for a family that doesn’t judge.\\n\\nI literally do not care what my neighbors believe or don’t believe. I agree Thank you, you are better than every god bothering nobody I am glad they burnt petrol pump, at least someone is unhappy because of hiked fuel prices :D Please talk about economy at this stage man please, people were saying the growth rate has been negative but since the 2020 has started I have heard or read no news on how the economy is going. I 100% agree, well said Religion is Politics. Something you use to keep society under control. But I wouldn\\'t use the f word here. Some people are good enough to do things on their own but plenty others need guidance.\\nAnd once again a rookie mistake of connecting Deity with Religion. \\nThe one who follows religion is the one who follows the rules of society. But the one who seeks God is the one who renounces all possesion and abandons the social life. I like this one It is superstition, like ghosts or bigfoot I really really wish Ravi Zacharias could respond to some these comments. It would be hilarious and sad at the same time... I didn\\'t know I had a twin in India. Wishing you a great life friend. Too Right 👏 I completely agree, especially with all the shit going on in Delhi rn Yup, finally someone said it. 👍🏻 Finally someone who gets it and is talkong sense. Religions are one of the biggest cancers of the world right now. And if you really believe the bullshit they tell, i dont know what to tell you... Life isnt a fairytale Now this is a good post! Religion is like spoiled milk. Hey fuck you buddy 👉🏻\\n\\nMODI GANGGG 🇮🇳 Hoes mad Time to sort by controversial Life was a party till religion came along..\\n\\nHumans still understood right from wrong because they have emotions... understanding right from wrong is all that matters... If only people have the will and the mind to believe what they actually believed all these years is utter bullshit. I can only imagine a better world without religion. More morale, more discipline, and a whole lot of love. Thank you OP, you are correct. Very well written and I wish you the best.\\n\\nThere are some wonderful Bollywood anti-religious movies available. These three movies are quite funny and a few of my favorites. \\n\\n[Dharam Sankat Mein (\\'Religion in Trouble\\')](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4354740/?) - *At the age of 55, a Hindu man discovers that he was born Muslim and adopted by a Hindu family.*  It has a score of 6.3 on IMDB; \\n\\n[PK](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2338151/?) - *An alien lands on earth and acts so crazy they ask if he\\'s \\'PK\\' which means \\'tipsy\\' or \\'drunk.\\'* It has a score of 8.1 on IMDB; and \\n\\n[OMG: Oh My God](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2283748/?) - *An atheist files at lawsuit against God.*. It  has a score of 8.2 on IMDB.\\n\\n[Here\\'s a list of 7 movies that reflect the dark side of religion.](https://in.bookmyshow.com/entertainment/movies/hindi/bollywood-movies-on-religion/) Those three are on that list, as well as several that look serious.  I just posted asking why religion is a sensitive topic and everyone downvoted and this has 2.9k likes xD Yo what pissed you off to this extent man? If it brings people happiness.and peace of mind.  It’s wonderful.  And it’s fun to think about what came first the chicken or the egg. Who is reading this in 2020? You\\'re a good person for this, OP. I respect your opinion I see that title, I upvote. Isn\\'t it ironic that almost all atheist have a God complex ? Finnaly something I can read...lmao Here from /r/all and I just wanted to say, **hell yes India!**  Your country seems amazing in many ways, but also so damn backwards... TIL that \"atheist\" or \"none\" is not even an option for official religions/beliefs in your country.  When you look at the trends for how humanity is progressing, almost every advance is met by a decline in religion.  \\nGet that shit outta there!  \\nAnd this, from a \\'spiritual\\' person, Buddhist/Atheist, functionally agnostic, and Canadian, for context if it matters.  \\nMay you all be well and happy, may you all be at peace. Congratulations, you\\'ve just explained the core of Buddhism!  I\\'m only partly joking. Buddhism\\'s main tenents are non-theistic and are about abandoning attachment in order to live fully in the moment and see the world clearly.  But I get your point. Man I wish more people could read this. The whole country needs to read this! a wise man once said Religion is the opium of the masses.. any guess who? but in india that ideology is also made a villain by constant propaganda. if anyone can kick sanghi asses its them. The early people realizes the best. What makes me angry the most is that it is killing the scientific temper in our ppl! Preach. Heh.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSeriously though. Yes. Fuck\\'em all. Take it back, Flying Spaghetti Monster is REAL Of course everyone is confused. The universe is infinitely complicated. We shouldn\\'t look down on them for their ignorance. I don\\'t think all religions are bad but I don\\'t think any of them are 100% correct. I do believe there is something after we die. You can\\'t create or destroy anything in this reality. It only changes form. This. Fuck yeah, man. You nailed it; fuck religion! anti-religion and reddit, name a more classic duo They only way to overcome what is happening is Education Education and more Education which is seriously lacking in this nation. Yeah man. All the most horrible stupid people I know are religious. I think it\\'s a direct correlation to not thinking critically and being a blind sheep follower. That\\'s why USA is so fucked up right now. All these idiots believe everything they are told on facebook and white supremacist propaganda sites. Fuck Religion. Finally I don’t know what’s going on in India right now but come on man calm down. A belief is merely an opinion one refuses to reconsider. That, and pride in beliefs is the ultimate in egotism. Let it all go, and people can be free and better. one hundred percent agreed The first part is pretty much what i think about religion as well, it\\'s a very well organized scam to convert people to believe in some bullshit as well as syphon as much money as they can from the individual. Since when a sub about Inda got so smart, you\\'re right tbh Did not expect this post in r/india, kinda refreshing to see this mindset. I am not too keen on religion myself. r/atheism Yeah science is cool! Marx once said, \"Religion is the opium of masses\". I Don\\'t follow his ideology but he straight up was throwing truth bombs in 1800s. Still relevant to this day! As someone who’s never been involved in any religion, I just can’t seem to understand how people can use a collection of stories from 2000 years ago to justify acts of murder and conflict. All religions are just hate groups, but they’re “justified” because they have religious intent. “We hate the gays, but our 2000 year old book says it’s okay, so we are the ones in the right”. Nice post OP, it’s good to know that there is some resistance to the brainwashing that is religion How about fuck the people who cant respect other people\\'s beliefs without murdering them and destroying their places of worship I disagree with the part where you know what happens after death. No one knows it and no one will ever know. Just impossible. It could be a big simulation for example. Fuck all your beliefs as well. Coronavirus knows no religion and likely coming soon. The great equalizer. https://suchanek.name/texts/atheism/index.html Came out the gate swinging There is a Facebook group for atheist parents if people are interested. It’s called Godless Parents. I don’t use Facebook much but wanted to throw out that option. The group is for getting support and ideas on raising children outside of any faith and how to deal with family/friends/schools who sneak it in. Religion shouldn\\'t exist in the 21st century.\\nIt exemplifies human weakness to keep depending on a false sense of hope that doesn\\'t exist.\\nI hate it to the core, probably this is the one thing I hate the most in the world. All things that further separate us from one another (such as religion) are things we ought to step away from as soon as possible. Finally a person who speaks the truth Ok but who the fuck started imagining blue monkeys and elephants as gods, fucking polytheists Whilst I do agree with everything you said, confirmation bias will insure that your words fall on deaf ears when they are most needed.  Humanity can be both awesome and terrible.  I would like to think the awesome will win out, but I fear it will not.  Best of luck.  Maybe you will get some people to hear your message. Look up a guy named Mark passio on YouTube bro. You won\\'t feel so isolated in your thoughts. Sort by controversial. Don\\'t forget to get your popcorn Here here dear friend!! Ok, but how does that have anything to do with India... I used to feel that religion was the bane of mankind, but I’ve evolved into the idea that it’s irrationality that’s the issue, not really religion. I know many religious people that don’t reflect the worst of their cohort, and it’s trivial to demonstrate that non-religious societies often replicate the worst aspects of religious behavior. What passes for “religion” in most places is really just a combination of bigotry and self-interested politics. Background: I run a humanist, atheist organization, and I don’t like religion. Love of God/ Fear of Wrath of God ..... whichever way you look at it , whats has been significant?:\\n\\nthe pain and misery has been caused becuase of it \\nor\\nthe amount of pain it has prevented/ aleviated.\\n\\nEach will have a different opinion on this.\\n\\nMaybe we can look at it a different way:\\n\\nEverything starts out with a good purpose and intentions .... but along the way certain individuals find a way to contort/skew/misinterpret/misrepresent relegion to their advantage and greed.\\n\\nFaulting religion for the misdeeds of individuals of use it for their greed and gluttony is like blaming the easy target.\\n\\nThe emotional reponse of Love and Hate are equally strong and powerfull.\\nThese miscreants know that faith is so emotionally engrained/entwined in us that we would repond to it strongly.\\n\\nTriggering an emotional response in us based on hate  is easy for these people.\\nthats what they are gud at.\\n\\nHate these individuals.\\nDont hate the faith.\\n\\nIf it was easy to be nice and kind then there wouldnt be any pain and sadness in the world.\\n\\nit\\'s in times like these that ones needs to find compassion and kindness in their heart for one and all. Based on the current events I am feeling proud for leaving religion. Still my family is extremely relegious but both me and my sibling has permanently left relegion. You too have your religion m8, so shut up! I don\\'t give a fuck what anyone else believes as long as they make the world a better place. Fuck yeah! When it comes to bullshit, big-time, major league bullshit, you have to stand in awe of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims, religion. No contest. No contest. Religion. Religion easily has **the greatest bullshit story ever told**. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there’s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever ’til the end of time!\\n\\nBut He loves you.  - George Carlin Amen Oof India is absolutely driven by religion. Remember friends, sort by controversial ;) Thank you! This guy gets it. I agree I like how this was put under the flair politics, because ultimately that is what all of religion is, powerplay politics Yawn. Fuck off. \\nBelieving in something does not make you any less valid. \\nBelievers can be just as kind and good for the world as anyone else.\\nKeep on with your anger and hate, I live each day to the fullest and only think about my religion based on how grateful I am each day. \\nYou are not special for not believing in anything. \\n\\nOrganized religion is damaging but the instant you go after people\\'s personal beliefs you become an asshole. I\\'m a kind person but fuck off. Start with eating beef Edgy Damn, knowing the people on Reddit I fully expected this post to be downvoted to hell. I guess you were lucky Today my exam didn\\'t go well exactly and my grandma blamed it all on my black shirt. They say its not the black colour god day. Honestly am i to laugh or use this fact as an advantage . Perfectly summed up, really well said. Having a religion is like totally not believing in yourself Damn.. Never thought I\\'d see this in an Indian subredit. Our country is pretty religious.  I\\'ve never really met another atheist and we can\\'t be vocal here.  \\n\\nI must agree that religion is a major source of unrest in India. It\\'s getting scary. I love this country but I can\\'t say I\\'m proud of it. \\n\\nIt seems that for every step forward, we take two steps back.  I\\'m hoping that change will happen and I do plan on doing my part in it. This is lame  Exhaust people loose morals without religion. People say “tHaTs NoT tRuE” but have no evidence for that besides atheist are nice sometimes. You don’t have to believe and people shouldn’t force you to believe but don’t talk bad about it. You just sound like an asshole, like saying “FUCK FAMILIES because theirs a big universe and spending time with them is a waste of to me.” Some people value families like religion so don’t be such a fucking dick about it. I agree that religion has caused nothing but trouble on a large scale. I\\'m strongly against organized religion because it tries to make claims about the unknowable and dictate how other people should live based on these beliefs. Which is also what this post, and athiests in general, also do yet never seem to realize it. Self aware wolves, the lot of you.\\n\\nNo one knows if there is a God or not. No one knows if there is heaven or hell. No one knows that upon death it\\'s simply black and nothing. No one knows the truth to any of this with any certainty at all. In this regard, atheists are just as infuriating as theists. Both sides make claims about he unknowable and try to dictate how others should live and believe based on their own personal beliefs. What makes them comfortable. \\n\\nIt takes a tremendous leap of faith to believe in god and a tremendous leap of faith to disbelieve. Neither side is right just because they shout it at you.\\n\\nBelieve whatever you want. Let others believe whatever they want. Recognize you have no way to know who is right or wrong about the unknowable, and leave each other alone when it comes to their beliefs.\\n\\nThe general messages about good character from religion are great. Some people need that from a book, others don\\'t. All religions share the general message of \"don\\'t suck\" and \"be good to others\". Just do that and you\\'re probably winning this game.\\n\\nPersonally, I believe in god completely. I believe in an afterlife. But I completely reject all organized religion because of the reality that no one knows the truth on any of this, along with most major religions having thousands of years of murder, rape, and pedophilia under their belts. I don\\'t need someone else to tell me what to believe or think about the unknowable, especially not someone or some organization with that track record and lack of humanity in direct contradiction to their messages.\\n\\nBasically, if anyone tries to tell me what to think about the unknowable, theist or atheist, they can piss off. You don\\'t know anything. No one does. Sit down, shut up, and let people believe whatever they want about such things. I wonder what happened to this guy... lmao. TLDR;\\nI guess the post heading sums it up. I’m with you bro. Fuck all religion except mine./s I fully believe religion is main hindrance to the progress of the human race and people just go around wanting to ‘respect’ others and their ‘religions’. It’s all bullshit. Modi Failed India big time. He failed economy and now Delhi is burning. He needs to act fast and step down before whole india get burned. Anger comes from things you don’t understand.  \\n\\nOne day you will.\\n\\nTill then stay angry my friend. John Lennon was ahead of his time. I wish I had coins to award this post (unfortunately I don\\'t have any till now lol). One of the best posts I have seen here. Truth!! 💯 You go India man or woman or not determined yet! Religion is a mental illness. Simple. I\\'m not a big fan of religion either, but I\\'m also not going to shut someone down if they\\'re using it as a coping mechanism. As long as they aren\\'t a dick about it and are actually a good person, they can use whatever they want to cope. There\\'s worse things than religion. So what if they\\'re afraid of death? I\\'m happy you\\'re taking that reality so well but some people struggle to the point where their life is seriously impacted, and a small glimmer of hope that is an after life can improve their quality of life. Amen to that you know... some of what youre saying isnt too far off, but on the other hand some of it is fairly ignorant   \\n\\n  \\n\\nfor example, you state that death means you cease to exist as if it\\'s a matter of fact.  you\\'re certainly confused and I will attempt to lead you toward objective fact as opposed to your opinion.  \\n\\n  \\n\\nfirst thing to recognize is, youre having an identity issue.  you seem to think that you are your body. (you\\'ve identified with it)  and when the body dies, it must mean you die too. that\\'s not quite accurate.  you are not your body.  if you lose  an arm for instance, you\\'ve lost a part of your body, but you havnt lost yourself.  you still exist.  that\\'s because what you are is something more, beyond name and physical form. so what are you?  well the truth of the matter is, you are life. you are the life allows your physical body to function. and when you, the life, departs from that body it will be dead.  but you can not \\'lose your life\\' when you ARE life.  you just move on to a new form.  \\n\\n  \\n\\nno i know this may seem like it took a religious turn as im essentially talking about what is generally known as \\'reincarnation\\', but the simple fact is there\\'s a fuckton of evidence for it.  sure the ancient religions have known for a while, but similar to you, im over religion, i dont find it very useful.  I with off the top of my head I could remember a lot of good sources that show the reincarnation must be an actual thing, as I have seen many, but just to get you started, there is a documentary called \\'the boy who live before\\' I believe.  I could describe it but its better to just judge for yourself.  Basically a child is able to remember his past life, and they track down his old town, old house, family etc.. and its a great mystery how he knew all the details of that old life...  \\n\\n  \\n\\nin any case, you right in that you dont need religion.  in fact the just conflate and confuse things, but dont stop looking for answers!  you dont have it all figured out Dont hate the game,  hate the player. Best reddit post ever! Yeah. Fuck it all. Damn look at the amount of foreigners here I don\\'t think it\\'s the religious experience of individuals that is so destructive but institutionalised religion alias the church that blinds people and detaches individuals from what religion really is. I mean, we\\'re making examples of all the war and futile deaths that came as a cause of religion but come to think about it, how many of the people who committed those acts were truly religious. Almost none of the christian community live by the example of Jesus and the bible, they follow it because it\\'s what the mass does and the more you just follow the mass, the less individual you become. \\n\\nSo let\\'s not say fuck religion.\\n\\nFuck the Church. Fuck Creed. Fuck the institution. Word. I\\'m gonna print this and hang it in my room. Sad but true religion is bad. If Trump can  cheat on 3 wives and still be considered Christian and appointed by god by the evangelical community then somethings something wrong with it. Yeah, yeah, we get it. Anyone with an ounce of ability to think critically can tell that organized religion is magical nonsense. This isn\\'t something that\\'s susceptible to rational argument, however. Your arguments aren\\'t going to change the minds of the devout, and you aren\\'t telling us anything new. Most of the violence in human history has been over material resources or ideology. Got it.\\n\\nInstead of simply shitting on everyone who feels differently than you do, why not take a more scientific approach? *Why* do most people on earth subscribe to one religion? Why do humans believe in god(s)? Instead of just telling people that they\\'re wrong (with numbers, charts, and diagrams to illustrate the depth of their wrongness,) isn\\'t it time to address the more fundamental, underlying issues at work? Religion isn\\'t something that\\'s *being done* to people, it is ubiquitous, and it appears in isolated populations. As far as I know, there isn\\'t a human culture, now or in historical record, that was without religion.\\n\\nI suspect that your frustrations are caused by two things: religious or magical thinking, and a willingness to exploit people who rely on magical thinking. The first I find to be strange, and quite interesting, while the second is common and reprehensible. Don\\'t confuse \"the church\" (or any other religious authority) with religious thought.\\n\\nI\\'m an atheist, and I\\'ve never been part of any religion. I accept most of your position, but if you\\'re willing to ask people to shed their beliefs and adopt yours, why don\\'t you try a little experiment? For one month, learn all you can about one, particular religion. Learn about its history, art, culture, tenets, writings, and if possible spend time with adherents. Go to a house of worship, shrine, temple, or whatever. Set your reservations completely aside for one months, and immerse yourself. Deeply, honestly pursue an understanding. Leave your preconceptions behind (they\\'ll be there at the end of the month when you need them,) and try it. If you pick Islam, pray five times a day. Whatever you pick, stick with it, and keep your critical mind on a shelf, for the moment.\\n\\nIsn\\'t telling people that a mode of thought is worthless, harmful, and destructive a little bit... wel... uninformed, if you aren\\'t willing to attempt to see the world from their perspective first? What you\\'ve said takes guts to say in front of public. Imagine saying something like this in public. Probably the person would get lynched. I too believe religion instead of being a solution has been root of many problems more than often. At least the younger generation in metropolitan cities can accept the concept of atheist and that\\'s some kind of progress, but definitely people need to be more accepting and hopefully that will change in future. Excellent post. Consider the vastness of the universe, with 99.9999% being unobservable to us, and consider the unsuitability of almost all of the observable universe towards life.\\n\\n\\nThen consider that we exist here now, on a rock floating around in nothingness around a burning hot mass of gasses, hurtling away from all such pairs at celestial speeds spreading out further into oblivion.\\n\\n\\nConsider the astronomical odds for every event that played out exactly as it did to lead up to us existing here now, and then multiply them with each other to get the infinitismally insignificant chances of us existing, and yet here we are.\\n\\n\\nUntill we are able to explain how or why, religion will continue to exist. Fun fact: Because of religion killing and hunting all nonbelievers and scientists in the medieval ages and earlier, humanity devolved a thousand years. Think bout that. Shit dog, don\\'t hold back next time. See that guy over there, eating dinner with his family just like us? He\\'s a different religion and deserves to die.\\n\\nThat\\'s how stupid our fucking world is. I think the problem is extremists. I believe everyone should be able to believe whatever they want as long as it doesn\\'t affect everyone else. Why can\\'t people just leave each other alone. The world would be a better place if people just respected each other\\'s beliefs and not shove them down each other\\'s throats. People should be able to treat each other like the human beings that we are no matter what religion or beliefs we have. If your religion condemns something someone else is doing, then leave them alone to be condemned. It doesn\\'t affect anyone else\\'s life but theirs. I\\'m not religious but I respect what people believe in even if I dont believe in those beliefs because it doesn\\'t affect me in the least. I\\'m ok with anything as long as it doesn\\'t violate anyone\\'s basic human rights. Extremism is the real enemy. Saw this on popular. C’mon man I’m an atheist but if you want religious people to take you seriously you can’t be aggressive about it The problem is not religion it\\'s religious extremists. Religion can be used for good and bad there is more than one side to it. This guy gets it I wouldnt say “Fuck” all religions, but I would say before you can be anything, you must first be a good human being with a clean heart. OP a lil much, you can be a good person and demonstrate great values all while being religious, some people just are not. I love how the subject is religion, yet these autistic ducks of reddit are talking about America  imperialism in the comments, this has to be the most ADHD social media platform on the planet. I thought I was in r/UnpopularOpinion How did I end up here I support you Bae, fuck all religions Sanket? what a fucking reddit moment Religion is messed up I agree. I do believe in a God as the chances of everything aligning so perfectly for life to be formed is minuscule. You may disagree with me but I\\'ll believe what I want to believe. I dont force it on others and I respect their opinion as long as their opinion isnt like OP\\'s, calling people out and saying they are stupid and dumb. There isn\\'t proof of god but there isnt proof against it either. Lack of proof is NOT proof. Well, damn. Congratulations. Cringiest thing I\\'ve read all day I wish we could blame it on religion, but I think humanity would still find a reason to destroy itself. Our nature is conflict, religion is just an excuse. Totally agree.. We humans are the worst creature so brave So glad to see this on front page with 12k upvotes.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHow the fuck is centuries old religion still mainsteain in 2020, after we\\'ve explored space to such an extent and made such scientific advancements, I will never know.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nRemember the Sun was a deity? Oh, that\\'s a \"false\" religion, got it guys. But that noahs ark shit, pretty hardcore. Oh, you don\\'t believe THAT part? Go fuck yourselves. [deleted] Hail Satan. Thank you for saying this. This was beautiful, thank you. wow very brave! I am not religious but I have to disagree with you. There are a lot of people who need a religion to function. They just go with the rules because they are afraid of their gods but not of other people. They would turn into criminals if they accept that religion is completely made up. Other people need it so they don\\'t feel lonely in this world. Religion can be a beautiful thing but sadly it\\'s used mostly for bad things. Please let other be believers and mind your own business. I don\\'t believe in anything but don\\'t mind other people having a made up God in their life as long they\\'re being respectful to others. If they are not it\\'s because they are raised badly or have other issues, but not because of religion itself. It was made so people behave, to avoid chaos. And back then they didn\\'t had the answer to certain scientific questions and used \"God\" as a simple answer to everything. Some people don\\'t wanna hear the complicated answers and want to live a simple life. Let them be. >Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. \\n\\nMan, they could start a religion about this! Also fuck Modi You forget religion is the only reason humans coordinated on large scale in the first place, without it we would still be barbarians. Not that I believe in god or anything to that effect, humanity would have been doomed without it, but now that we have scientific basis for our actions we are just now approaching a point in time where we *shouldent* need it, so please don’t bash religion too hard, it has its place in our world even to this day. Once someone told me as a kid all the the Greek gods were fairy tales I stopped believing, why is theirs fake but ours real? Religion is complex, I don\\'t know much, but I know religious people who are exceptional people and I know that most have some good philosophys in them. They\\'re probably not suited to our modern age, but their part of our history and culture, so there isn\\'t a need to push it away; maybe to just see it as it is, a belief, nothing more. I have a genuine question, how many people think the world\\'s wars would just stop if there wasn\\'t religion? Do you think the corruption just ends because the veil it\\'s hidden behind is gone, or do you think it would still go on because in reality it\\'s all about greed and power and control?\\n\\n   My belief is religion is just a tool used to further the end result, and if it wasn\\'t/isn\\'t religion, it\\'s color, or it\\'s geographical location, or it\\'s wealth, or it\\'s because they\\'re shorter, or speak a different language, etc etc there\\'s always going to be some bias that divides people, and there will always be a mask to hide behind to do it. \\n\\n  I\\'m someone who finds comfort in having faith in something because there\\'s a lot left we really don\\'t know, whatever my idea is, but I don\\'t ignore scie xe, and I don\\'t go out of my way to harm people who don\\'t believe, or believe in something I don\\'t. I do agree that the power structure of it should be taken down, and it\\'s disgusting what it causes, but it\\'s the people that hide behind it that are the problem. I tried athiesm but, realized it was also a belief - George carlin Man the edge on this Fuck yeah!! Buddhism actually isn’t a religion that has the “answers” it’s actually about to let go of all the worries in the world like (where u go after u die) and simply quiet the mind  and humble yourself because we simply don’t know!! Insult people in an effort to convince them they\\'re wrong? Solid strategy. Spot on brother man. My “religion” is just treating people like I want to be treated. I know crazy right? Agree on every single points made. Hope more people actually get the message. These man made fairy tales are distracting the masses from progressing together. And instead introducing hatred and twisted views on our own species. Religion has seriously fucked up mankind and its realistic views on the world and created nothing but death and suffering on many levels. And your donation money definitely isn\\'t going to that charity, it\\'s going in father Matthews pocket. As OP said, everyone please wake up. >You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe.\\n\\nif thats true then just let people believe what they want to believe REDDIT MOMENT im satanist Amen brother! Are indians just now realizing this? Religion is the opiate for the masses Religion is an MLM/Pyramid scheme.  Always has been, and always will be.\\n\\nStart taxing religious organizations and things will change instantly. Fuck religion. Amen religion isn\\'t really about religion. it\\'s more like political strategy. unfortunately, it works on most people. 67% upvoted , everyone has entitled to their beliefs and that should be. I read an interesting article which basically explained why science can\\'t make countries adopt secularism. Anyway I\\'ll leave a copypasta here:\\n\\nReligion is like a penis. It\\'s fine to have one, ok to be proud of it, it\\'s even ok to share it with someone if they ask. But it\\'s not ok to shove it down someone\\'s throat against their will!\\n\\n...and keep it away from children! I mean I don’t believe in any religion but these kind of posts just make me uncomfortable, I think the less you worry about other people’s personal lives the better. Idk why this is r/India but I’m here for the drama! As much as I agree with you, how can you say that our legacy should be to better mankind, when in the end no matter how good mankind is everything ends the same? No one will be remembered for long, no one will will remember if you were a good person or not, so all wrong doing is pretty much as justified as doing the “right thing”. And like you said, spec of dust flying through space, a soon to be (in the cosmic scale) desolate spec of dust just like everything else. So in reality there is no “immortality” for us as you say. Wow... I\\'m speechless... Sometimes I wonder if trophies like NFL rings, Oscars, nominations, NBA trophies, etc. are just another object people idolize like how people worshipped cows. Kind of sad seeing it happen right in front of our eyes. \\'Fuck\\' religion that **tells people to go hurt/kill other people.** And \\'fuck\\' **dogmatism.**\\n\\nBut on the other hand, your idea that religion is there simply to provide people comfort against \"death\" is not something I necessarily think is proper. For me, some religious afterlives are worse than just having nothing at all - e.g. Buddhist Hells.\\n\\n>What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe.\\n\\nFrom a really cold empirical science perspective, you can say, it almost surely won\\'t. And if you\\'re going to adopt that stance, you should be honest about that. Everything gets reduced to entropy in the end, photonic gas, and 99.9999% of us will be forgotten in no more than a few generations at the very best, and the few that aren\\'t had a lot of probability work in their favor to get them there.\\n\\nIf you want to argue for a worldview rooted solely and purely in cold, hard empirical science, then you have to go **fully** honest about it and the things that *really* make me pop my head are not so much things filled up wholly with lies but which have a large quantity of truths and then *one little snag*.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m not saying that somehow \"proves\" religion right. I\\'m saying that if you are going to argue it this way, you *should be* honest about it.\\n\\n**Any** kind of *dogmatic ideology*, I find, is poison. It doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s religious or not. What matters is that it does not tolerate dissent. What matters is if you have decided those who refuse it are evil. All political ideologies go the same way, and the toxic effect of treating them dogmatically and intolerantly is every bit as plain as for religion. Interestingly, you have done just that, and said everyone who believes in religion is \"😈evil😈\". Good, I\\'ll keep being 😈evil😈 then. Proud 😈Devil😈 here. Just as I\\'ll keep being \"😈evil😈\" in the view of any other dogmatist who tells people to just suck up their dogma and don\\'t critically evaluate each bit of it with a fine grained comb and I\\'ll almost always find something to disagree with. Including \"religious\" dogmatists, too, of any stripe. Dogma systems are straitjackets for the mind. Any system that one cannot be flexible with or reserve adherence to all its tenets, inflexibly, rigidly, under threat of personal invalidation, is a mental straitjacket and exactly the kind of poison your *legitimate* points rightfully indict.\\n\\nAnd believe it or not, saying \"I *believe\" or* \"I *don\\'t believe*\" in \"God\", are *both* actually equally and more honest than saying \"I *know*\" the answer to this, or asserting it as an absolute fact. There is a hubris in both believing that we can *know* beyond the limits of our sense and empirical experience, as much as there is in believing that actual reality must be coterminous therewith. Neither such statement or confidence can be justified based on reason. We can only justify what we *have* verified empirically, and anything past that is where we must cease to condemn and chastize disagreement. In full honesty, we cannot even *know* the \"laws of physics\" continue forever. Our empirical evidence, our *experience*, gives us no reason to *suspect* they will break, and can give us *confidence* in them, but they just *might*, and maybe there are places they don\\'t apply that we haven\\'t found yet. One can, of course, pull out the Russell tea pot argument and say it\\'s irrelevant, but my point is not to argue its relevance any more than its correctness, but rather to argue against your moralism of people, which is as reprehensible as that which has flowed from the mouth of any authoritarian religious preacher in any religion.\\n\\nPeople should not be considered vile for *whatever* they believe in this matter. I have no problem with you going for atheism, I have a **big** problem with you calling people evil, simply on dint of a *belief*. **That** is what leads to all the horrible things you rightfully indict.  You or someone like you may become the next persecutor. The only way to stop persecution is for everyone to respect disagreement.\\n\\nAnd no, I\\'m not then saying \"persecute the persecutor\" or \"persecute the ones who say people are evil\". I am voicing both my own disagreement and my intent to not be daunted by your taunts. Some thousand years ago, the purpose of religion was not to create chaos as it is today, rather to create a civilisation and induce fear of God so that man may not commit wrong deeds.\\n\\nToday, we have nations and better human development systems like schools and universities and hence we don\\'t need religion.\\n\\nI always say, religion is a tax which we are paying.\\n\\nNow, not having a religion does not mean god does not exist, and if atheism is based on the belief that God does not exist, also give rise to a religion where people believe unequivocally on the non-existence of a non-existent.\\n\\nSo, it is better to have God but no religion. I used to think this was true. But recently I\\'ve realised that religion is just a stick for people to hang their tribalism and prejudice on. \\n\\nYou could remove all religion tomorrow and we\\'d find something else to fight over. In fact you can already see it in politics and things like Brexit. \\n\\nThe troubles in Northern Island were labelled as religious but really they were territorial and tribal. I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s the same in the middle east. \\n\\nReligion just gives you a rule book or some easy way to pit yourself against someone else. Fuck religion I agree with everything this enlightened gentleman said. People need comfort, religion gives them comfort.\\n\\nPeople need to feel good about themselves, and religion makes people feel good about themselves (at the expense of others) Yes. This. Religion is a distraction from any complexity. People hate people because <insert your text here> [religion, caste, race, age, gender, national origin, color, ethnicity, political views... Etc etc] Religion was invented by power hungry elites to control the generally ignorant population. I second this. I\\'m an ex Muslim Indian. Fuck ALL religions. You know what, amen to this! In bible first murder was also to get recognition from god... But they dont see that.. The thing is if the God didn\\'t meddled with Able and Cane\\'s life for getting sacrifice.. the story would have been different... ya, but as the people join atheism, they will use that to oppress the one with religion. Religion is not the problem, people using it to their advantage and manipulating others is. If you think joining atheism may do some good, wait till some atheist goes and beats up religion following people.\\n\\nI don\\'t think any religion serves hate, and those who really practice religion are not goons. \\n\\nsorry for bad English and typos if any. I am gonna come back to this and gain my sanity when I seem to lose it. Thanks! Care about yourselves and the people around you. We build this world, not God or anything else. We don\\'t know all the answers, but we will find them step by step. I’m not a religious person but is this is such a Reddit tier post. Genghis khan didn’t kill millions of Chinese and Iranians out of Tengrism. Tribalism is inherent to humanity, we will always find a reason to divide and hate Humans observe something.\\n\\nHumans try to explain that something. \\n\\nHumans fail to do so.\\n\\nHumans create imaginary power to explain thing they failed to explain previously.\\n\\nBAM religion.\\n\\nNow, humans do science.\\n\\nNow, science succeeds in explaining things that were previously unexplainable.\\n\\nNow, despite having scientific evidence and explanation of stuff, (some) humans still believe in religion instead. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nScience and religion cannot coexist. \\n\\nReligion must be excluded from politics in and shape or form.\\n\\nAnything that has to do with religion should not be supported financially by the state and therefore by taxes. All financial support for anything religious should be shifted to support causes which are based on science.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\neveryone should still be free to believe in whatever he or she wants. No one should get any disadvantages from doing so, but (and that is the important part!): no one should get any benefit from doing so either. And everyone who tries to manipulate anyone else in believing into something that he or she does not yet believe in, should face trial for religious missionary work, which should be illegal to begin with. Being Atheist and being a human is the best thing to be in this world. Amen! EUPHORIC Preach brother! Can\\'t we just use some made up religion for ids like dinkoism or the church of flying spaghetti monster? I applaud you for your courage. Hopefully India breaks free of it\\'s chains and can finally start being a secular nation, or at least, a nation where the separation of Church and State is upheld.\\n\\nGood luck to you and your country friend. I\\'ve been calling myself a Hindu atheist for 3 years now, since the age of 15. I was proud to belong to an ancient culture of tolerance, peace and justice. I was proud of our customs, ways and multiple traditions, hence I called myself a Hindu atheist, even though I rejected all religion and their philosophies including Hinduism. Today, I no longer want to be called a Hindu. I no longer want to associate myself with tribalism. Religion is a threat to life. Religion is organized crime. Religion does not belong in developed societies. Religion is the preamble to barbarism. No religion can take moral high ground. Fuck Religion. I officially denounce hinduism. Those many medals are giving me anxiety .

Glad to see someone vent it out I wish I saw this when I was like 8 I was already a non believer but was to scared to tell anyone Happy that you said it and the kind of response it got.

When the constitution clearly wants us to put aside the religious differences and want common good for everyone, I don\\'t think, we, people are not ready yet to think in such higher terms. After all these years since we said our good byes to British, we only inherited the golden divide and rule policy to keep people invested in their religious sentiments and derive political and economic returns from them. I don\\'t see a near future where people can see through shit and have a true democracy. It\\'s sad, but it\\'s also a painful truth. You\\'re a horrible person for telling people what they can and can\\'t believe in. Religion is one of the reasons this world hasn\\'t completely gone to shit. Keep your horrible opinions to yourself, no one cares what you do or dont have to say about others beliefs. [I like to watch this scene from Mr. Robot every once in a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSQHJXtfpE) Bhai everyone here already knows all this. If your intent of writing this post was to make people \"woke\" then you should post this on family WhatsApp groups. If your intent was just to rant, well, then let me tell you that we already understand this perspective. Yes, by all probablility, God does not exist, and even if He does, it is of no consequence since God doesn\\'t interfere in any way we can see. However, I strongly disagree with your notion that religion is the \\'root of all evil\\'. History proves that religuous societies tend to be more successful, likely because people tend to shy away from crime or disobedience if they feel that \\'a higher power is watching them.\\'\\n\\nMore importantly, religion provides us with hope, something to be happy about and look forward to in grim times. What if there were no Christmas or Diwali or Eid? Life would be rather monotonous and dull. The greatest works of art, literature, music, even science were inspired by religion, be it Sufi ghazals, Rennaissance frescos, or Hindu epics. Yes it is true, communal tension and xenophobia is largely a product of religious extremism, but ultimately, religion has done more good than harm.\\n\\nIn the \\'grand scheme of things\\' religion and humanity itself is undoubtably insignificant. However, by pusuing that train of thought any longer than necessary, you end up living a sorry nihilistic life. Instead, it\\'s much more prudent to enjoy the culture and vibrancy associated with each religion, rather than getting swallowed up by fanatacism or depression. \\n\\nReligious texts are some of the most enlightening philosophical pieces ever written if you take the time to understand them, and if you\\'ve actually read some, you\\'d realize that it\\'s not the crap about a \\'One true God\\' that is meant to be read, but the centuries of moral and ethical teachings poured into them by countless \\'spiritual\\' leader i.e. basically just modern-day philosophers. Buddhism is actually nice bro. Buuut yeah we get your point. >Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion.  \\n   \\nYou do realize that everything is made up bullshit. Including ideas like \\'equality\\', \\'liberty\\', \\'money\\'. Things like equality are fantasy born in some human minds. Just like religion. But we embrace it.   \\n   \\nThe only reality of our species is \\'survival\\'. Thats the only reality. Everything else is fantasy. Equality, religion, discrimination, liberalism, etc. I believe in religion. You can have your own opinion.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t believe it\\'s up to you but claiming that no God exists is more irrational (even mathematically) then saying God does exist.... I understand your sentiments. \\n\\nBut, tell me, if you\\'re so insignificant, why should anyone listen to you? Why do you feel anger? What special rights do you have? Why not cull humans who don\\'t deliver value to society? Why not go killing each other anyway? It\\'s a one time fun.\\n\\nDo you realize that the sense of greater good, a belief in rising higher is what sustains us and religion is a byproduct of that?\\n\\nAnd you\\'re not able to prove, nobody is, that humans are insignificant. Neither are the religions able to prove that there\\'s a heaven or hell after death.\\n\\nBut the mystics of every religion, who have refined their minds, have philosophies that logically convince us that humans are a superior expression of the force that created the supernovae. OH GOD THIS GUY Okay, I understand where you\\'re coming from. But don\\'t shit on other people\\'s belief, that\\'s pretty rude.\\n\\nIf you wanna shit on anyone/anything shit on the people who differentiate and spread hate based on religion, culture etc etc. Religion helped us, Sapiens, shape our world as it is today. It\\'s a fact that we need common beliefs, be it religion, fiction, science or any other imaginary concept, to work our way up together.\\n\\nReligion has played its role in bringing us so much further than we expected.\\n\\nIt\\'s sad to see something that was supposed to help us work together, build and design our future has taken a wrong turn into violent extremism and foolishness. Somebody finally fucking understands me. \\nI am a 15 year old atheist. I hate that God Who created all the trouble between us. He never existed. So what\\'s the meaning of science if he fucking exists.!?\\n\\nFuck you All Religions Well said buddy. This was a good read. Live and let live.. keep thy religion to thy fucking self. Simple fuckin rule. \\n\\nThey have used this card for far too long to stay in Power.\\n\\nI do not believe in karma or a higher power, but to be fair I hope who actually caused this! The hate speech deliverers and the people in power who could\\'ve stopped this would get the justice they deserve. \\n\\nReally shameful to call myself an Indian. religion is the most damaging thing to ever plague humanity. i will never understand why even in 2020 the populace refuse to acknowledge the damage. i want to believe we will someday grow beyond it, but we already should have and the evil might plague us even for another 5000 years. i\\'m sure there were people who understood this 5000 years ago, and they lost hope for this world same as i do now. If there can be a \"prefer not to say\" for gender, why can\\'t we have a religion that can have the same ideology. Excellent....been waiting for this one. 👏👏 Join r/atheismindia Buddhism is not intended to be a religion my friend, but I agree. Still though, the whole part about being insignificant and matter and the universe and all that, that was very Buddhist lol.\\n\\nJust to clarify. Buddhism in its core (without all the religious mumbojumbo) is about accepting that everything ends and chilling the fuck out about it so you can be a nice person whos not driven by the constant need reduce your fear of death by indulging in activities that get you nowhere.\\n\\nBut yeah, fuck religions. I am an Atheist and i made my Whole Sikh Family Atheist, let\\'s change them one at a time. My religion is responsible for less death than yours -Andh bhakt I would like to use this to promote r/atheismindia May I propose creating a new sub called /r/indianatheists?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Looks like it already exists but is restricted.\\n\\nIn that case, I\\'ve created r/atheistsinindia Corona virus in India took 0 life.\\nGuess how many lives the religion virus took? I didn\\'t know there were so many atheists here, lmao. Happy to know that someone knows the truth. I think this belongs here :\\n\\nWhen a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month – that’s fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years – that’s a religion, and we are admonished not to call it ‘fake news’ in order not to hurt the feelings of the faithful (or incur their wrath).\\n          ---Yuval Noah Harari What you are offering is not a solution. But another label that people can put on themselves. And create separate factions with people identifying as this label. Just because you don\\'t pray to a \"made up diety\" does not make it any less religious in a way that truly matters.\\n\\nReligion is far greater, deeper and broader than you can imagine. Religion stems from a need in humans in general that is fundamental to human nature \\n\\n> Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova\\n\\nI am sure you feel superior somehow. When you curse the religions. Or doubt the sanity of people who follow religion. Or quote random scientific facts as moral arguments. You feel good about it. And you feel that you have found the true path. The path that lesser people don\\'t get, and it is your duty to preach this path to these people.\\n\\nSure go ahead. You are free to do so. \\n\\nBut starting by abusing and disregarding the competition is rarely a recipe for a successful business. Just an analogy. Don\\'t mind me. I am just here to read all the comments............ Trust me the only reason of making religion is to limit the thinking power, iq of a common guy\\n\\nThe same reason is with free internet and free surfing, our perception is made to be controlled by someone else.\\n\\nAI will take it to another level. Intelligent people are the most difficult people to   govern Wow, very brave post. Let us rise up, gamers, and overthrow the Religion! While I agree with you on religion, I find it really funny when you said. \\n\\n>the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.  \\n\\nThe reason I find this funny is because the only way you would actually know this is if you died, experienced it, then returned.  Else, you are just taking it on faith that that is what happens when you die.  \\n\\nSure we all know what happens to you body when you die.  But there is literally know way of knowing you stop existing. \\n\\nThis is why I’m agnostic.  I also don’t believe in organized religion personally.  But I don’t judge people (like you are) for their beliefs, I judge them for who they are. \\n\\nThis post is no worse than what you are hating. Been trying so hard to tell this to people but damn, I get heat from religious people. They hold no bars either. \\n\\nI feel like religious people are what is wrong with this world. If there is a God, well he can go fuck himself. Send me to hell. As a Hindu living outside India... this is really sad to see. The only connection I have to India is the fact that I’m a Hindu. Congratulations on throwing away 3000 years of rich history. Fuck this post sounds exactly like my existential crisis and almost had a panic attack reading it The reason why what you wrote lacks validity is that you talk only in great generalities, and that\\'s where the falsehood lies. What you are referring to as \"religion\" could refer to a very wide and complicated range of human behaviors, cultures, ideas. Your conclusion is really the height of arrogance because you think you\\'re the expert in a bunch of things you clearly know very little about, and in spite of your ignorance you want everyone to follow what *you* decree from your own self as an ideal culture, belief system, behavior, etc. The way you wrote your post, you\\'re acting like you\\'re some freaking prophet come to deliver us the Truth. Sit down, son. Try studying and learning more so you don\\'t sound so ignorant in the future.\\n\\nBy the way, how old are you? 15? You seriously think you\\'re justified in telling all humans on Earth to leave their wisdom and value systems just because you know grade-school level science and history?\\n\\n>We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.\\n\\nThis is very easy to disprove.\\n\\n>As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better\\n\\nPractically speaking, this did not happen. Scientific discoveries in history and advances in technology enabled humans to commit the greatest atrocities ever before witnessed.\\n\\n>but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed\\n\\nBaseless assertion, easy to disprove.\\n\\nYou arguments are also hypocritical, because it\\'s just as simple (but equally wrong) to assert that atheism is evil. The greatest instances of mass murder in human history were deliberately carried out by atheists or people following anti-religion ideologies. Fuck religion! RELIGION IS TERRORISM!!!!! This post only shows, how arrogant and actually disgusting atheists can be. i could take my time and dismantle every part of it, but you are definitly a lost cause. >You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe\\n\\nTo main kya job chod dun fir. Important transitions in history are seldom driven  primarily by human wishes. - The Sovereign individual Well, at a certain level, everything is insignificant, which doesn\\'t mean they need to be eradicated. Everybody is entitled to their view, and if that\\'s your view, then so be it. It\\'s an anthropological tendency to form cliques, and humans have evolved this way. It\\'s \"natural\" to not be a pariah. I\\'d like to go one step above and point out that rather than religion, it\\'s any **-ism** that ends up creating an \\'Us vs. Them\\' at scale and ends up creating the same problems as religion. That\\'s more down to human nature. Religion is something a lot of pacifist humans would like to point as increasing human misery. I\\'m not saying OP is wrong, he/she is right, to an extent, just that religion is the low hanging fruit in the 21st century. Even **Greed is as bad as Religion** but rarely do humans write gilded posts about **Greed** on this sub (may be there on other subs).\\n\\nIronically, most world religions advocated harshly against greed but look where we\\'ve all ended up. Is religion the real root of the problem or is it just the **enabler** for flawed humans ?\\n\\nIf it weren\\'t **religion**, it\\'d simply be some other -**ism** instead: Capitalism or Communism or something else. Humans, in general are not wired for contentment - That is our blessing as well as our curse.\\n\\nAlmost all humans are also wired towards some form of **group-ism**. That\\'s what helped us survive and proliferate as a species (i don\\'t mean individual survival but at group level).\\n\\nIn old days, religions (or more of **shared ideas and traditions** than **polarizing religion** as we call it today) actually helped groups (again, not individuals) to exceed the Dunbar number amongst other scientific advances. While this was perfect for handling large groups where a lot of people don\\'t know each other, not so great for peace when 2 different groups encounter each other with different perspectives of life. That is when religion as we know it today becomes - more of a liability and less of an asset.\\n\\nSo what\\'s the solution ?\\n\\n**Change human nature to be less power-hungry and greedy and more pacifist across all cultures** \\\\- Easier said than done. That\\'s actually the reason no-one wants to be the first to become pacifist, if your group is relatively peaceful but the other side doesn\\'t care about peace, just greed & resources, well then your group is history. I\\'m atheist but I think its foolhardy to believe that if we take away religion we\\'ll suddenly be in utopia. It\\'s better to face the fact that life is hard and try to incrementally improve rather than believe there\\'s a magical cure. [removed] Bahut hi badhiya likha gya, badhai ho iske liye.

The problem today isn\\'t religious differences.\\n\\nFree market capitalism and liberalism promised a bright future, which hasn\\'t really materialised. Since the 2008 crisis, there is widespread discontent globally, which is leading to a rise in extremism.\\n\\nYes BJP plays a communal brand of politics and flames the fire whenever it can, but that\\'s not the whole picture here. In our country it is taking shape as a communal issue. Religion is just the top most class in a hierarchy for classification.There will be always something to classify humans,right now it\\'s name is \"religion\". There was a philosopher who argued that mainstream Religion caused less violence, as it brought smaller groups into one large group, rather than smaller groups constantly fighting amongst themselves. Not sure I agree with this, but an interesting viewpoint Dunno have you tried religion without casteism?\\n\\nSeriously tho, there is a south park episode along these lines. Actually it\\'s a 3 or 4 partner where cartman goes into the future to get an x box. It involves talking otters.  “Certain linguistic anthropologists think that religion is a language virus that re-writes pathways in the brain, dulls critical thinking.”  - Rust Cohle (True Detective). Amem brother. Well, TBH, there is a reason why religion works, but people seemed to have taken it beyond that.\\n\\nReligion is an extremely effective way to buil faith in oneself and his work. \\n\\nFaith and belief are Powerful things. It\\'s like a substitute for people who can\\'t believe in themselves. And they\\'ve become so deep in the idea of this God helping us throughout life, that thinking otherwise would be inconceivable. i do not think this has to do with Religion, religion is just a cover for people to form groups. Humans being social animals tend to create groups , we see ants of the same species fighting it out to the death in wars, we see lions killing the young cubs to make the females receptive, and do not even get me started on the closest relatives of ours Chimpanzees, i saw a documentary where they literally beat to death and primate of another troupe just because he entered into their territory and proceeded to canibalize him. \\n\\nIn absence of religion we would just find something else to group  , be it race or region. Is atheism a religion? Buddhism? Come on man, all you\\'re doing is giving thanks for the teachings I used to think like you sometime back. Then I realised we would find reasons to divide ourself and then fight over it. Even in a world without religion there would be something else to divide us by and fight over. Proud atheist here. Absolutely loved reading this on this sub. Ngl, I was expecting a lot of backlash in the replies, but damn, I\\'m surprised to say the least. Feels good to see so many fellow Indian atheists.\\n\\nThanks for the sub recommendation. :) *nidharma vabha* Mahler tho All I\\'m saying is a gun can\\'t kill a person and everyone\\'s always said religion is for interpretation I\\'m personally not religious but to say it\\'s shit is pretty stupid. I think most religious books are pretty well written and give great moral stories Pope\\'s rapes children but that\\'s not the study of Christianity. Well you haven\\'t heard about jedi (the religion)........ Yes its a real recognised religion in new Zealand. Yeah man that is like, your opinion. Cause starting with “fuck you” is a great way to open people’s minds.... What did the Buddhists do? Isn\\'t buddhism about self improvement of ones relationship with self and nature? Honestly, I\\'m atheist and know little about buddhism aside from a religious studies class I took in college but from what I\\'ve seen Buddhists are more about preservation of nature and self which doesn\\'t seem bad (comparatively at least) to me. The sun isn\\'t big enough to supernova though You guys are clueless. Religion automatically declines with increase in wealth, as it has in the West. \\n\\nThe solution is to focus on improving the economy, which our government is also clueless about I totally get where you are coming from and I agree that most of religion is outdated, but I do not believe that it is pointless. My grandma is 70. She has nothing in life remaining other than religion. She would be sitting at home right now just letting her body go to waste but instead she goes to the temple every single day. It gives her purpose. Does that make her weak or a coward afraid of death? I think not. You might have come to terms with the fact that this life goes nowhere and just comes to an end, but it is not an easy concept to grasp. And it gets more and more horrible of a thought the closer you get to death when your body is in pain and your friends and family are withering away. \\n\\nReligion provides two things: community and a moral code. Community in the sense that even if you go somewhere where you are out of place, you will find a small group of like minded individuals through the local church or temple or mosque. It is kind of a support system, an extended family. And most importantly, it provides a moral code. Not everyone is born a genius with a perfectly set line on what is good or bad. It is taught. Which is why you can see certain traits throughout religions communities. \\n\\nThe problem with religion stems in two things: outdated logic-less rituals and religious supremacy. For the first point, there are outdated rituals like not letting females cook or go to the temple during periods that need to be understood and shut down. In the past, when people did not have an understanding of periods and females speaking up was taboo, this \"rule\" made them exempt from their most important daily duties- cooking and going to the temple. It is of course not relevant anymore because people actually talk about periods and understand them and husbands aren\\'t going to force their wives to cook when they are in pain and just need to rest for a bit. The second, and more harmful problem, is religious supremacy. Christianity and Islam actually believe that they are the highest form of religion and their path is the only true path. This is obviously a toxic mindset which belittles everyone else and also why there are religious missionaries trying to convert people into their religion. Hinduism is actually a very inclusive religion that says that there are many paths in life and you can be a good person no matter what path you choose. Unfortunately, this concept is getting lost on a lot of people and hence why we have seen a rise of hindutva.\\n\\nAll I\\'m trying to say is that here can be a little more nuance than \"fuck religion\" or \"this religion is the only path to salvation\". Word. I understand how you feel man, but what if, you’re wrong? I’m a Christian, I’ve study the Bible. From my point of view, there’s lessons and a lot, and I mean a lot of symbolism. I believe in science too. But sometimes I think about how did the universe start. That’s something I think people have no idea or have a clue on how to think about. They’re all theory’s. The universe is so vast and to think of it as 3 dimensional is pretty incomprehensible. But with my understanding of the Bible, it’s humanity that greatly distorts the underlying message of it.\\n\\nBut if everything is blank after death, I’m fine with that too because there’s versus in the Bible taking about getting some rest and I’m fine with that too lol Friendly reminder- there is still a large number of jews living in Germany today, but it was Hitler who shot himself to death I\\'m agnostic, but saying that if there was no religion, everyone would be happy and peaceful is plain wrong. Unfortunately we are social beings and so we tend to form groups, be it religion, colour, language, class, culture etc. And sooner or later groups will start fighting with each other. It just so happened that religion became a major cause of conflict You need to take some psychedelics and afterwards you’ll sound silly to yourself saying there is no afterlife/soul. I’m not saying it exists, I’m saying that we as ‘smart’ primates are too stupid to know and as you said we are so insignificant that how can we as a disease to our planet know what happens after death. We cannot and will never know. Just a thought :) > We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.\\n\\nThis is not really true. Ethnic and class identities also divide us. They are probably far more serious than religious differences. How is this post not about a \"religion\" you guys calls \"atheism\"?\\nYou are calling all the religions stupid and people believing in it are childish. But on the other hand you are so intolerant to all religions and wants everyone to believe in your beliefs that you were an early man then learned basic skills and tools.\\nWhy you want every religious person to believe in this and not in their scriptures?\\nAtheism is the most intolerant belief.\\nHumanity is not about stopping everyone to believe in their beliefs it\\'s about coexisting with tolerance, caring, and respecting each other\\'s opinions, beliefs, actions as far as they are not harming the others. Lots of things divide us that aren\\'t religion. Intelect, socioeconomic status, working class and white collar, sex, politics. Religion is definitely not the only thing. The problem comes with religious institutions being too big and having too much influence over people, not the specific religion in and of itself. I can see though why people wouldn\\'t want it and how there are definitely some religious people that need to wake up to sone sense of reality. Just want to point out that Buddhism wasn\\'t supposed to be a religion, but more a way of life (or a way to get through the suffering that is life)\\n\\nAdmittedly that isn\\'t always the case now, but please don\\'t go hating on all Buddhists.\\n\\nAlso, Buddhism is frequently mixed up with Taoism, which most definitely is a religion. No thx We aren\\'t sure yet whether early religion lead to urbanization (towns and cities), or if those communities lead to religion. It appears that religion came first and actually helped bring us together. \\n\\nI get your anger at religion. Except religion is just a tool. Would you blame the knife or the one that wields it. \\n\\nObviously that\\'s an oversimplification of a more complicated issue. \\n\\nAttacking people angrily whether verbally or physically isn\\'t go to make them change their beliefs. They\\'re going to dig in and fight back. \\n\\nIf you really want things to change do it peacefully. I seem to remember a man from India doing just that, and he happened to be religious. What happened that got OP mad? But you know, this is just ur opinion man ok Don’t tell me what to do Well bro, you might want to read Sapiens by Noah Hararj.. explains exactly the need for religion. How it is has been important throughout human history as a way to band people together behind a myth. I myself honestly don\\'t need a religion to respect another human and work with him/her. For me, I sometimes feel that the need for religion has run out its time. But reality is often different and you need to respect every religion and the people who get behind it. Why is it that when a black person gets offended, they try to involve more of their black friends to help gang up on you and leave you no room to talk by being loud and obnoxious? Can they not fight their own battles? Religion can be considered uncessecary, but I feel it\\'s a decent way to teach basic morals that sometimes parents fail to do. Growing up around in a city full of mormons, that\\'s probably the one thing I appreciate from their cult. Not to mention religion is a good outlet to experience and understand a lot of cultures. But yeah the beliefs are fucked Amen!!  Preach brother!! I loled hard when I saw the link to the atheism subreddit in the end. Kinda out of place I felt. I know you\\'re angry because of whats going on but this an emotional argument against religion, not an objective one. You\\'ve claimed many things, and several are without proof. You\\'ve claimed other things, some with truth. You are entitled to your opinion to hate religion but the reality is we are an insignificant spec in the universe and you don\\'t have all the answers to many of the points you have said so you say \"fuck all\" to it. That isn\\'t a logical solution.\\n\\nWhat is logical is to understand why they hate and to fix that. You say religion is whats wrong with the world but you also fail to mention at lack of religion. Look at athiest China and Soviet era and see what they\\'ve done. And no this isn\\'t an argument against athiesm, but it is the same point people make when they say thiests kill people over thiests. Besides that, lets be honest, I doubt that the hindu or Islamic scriptures incite people to actively go fight and kill people unjustly and I sincerely believe you don\\'t believe it does either. Many of these hardliner terrorists are uneducated in their own religions and common education, selfish, and just plain pieces of shits that need to die. u/motapi Buddhism isn’t a religion, it’s a path and doesn’t believe in any god. Buddhist can believe what they want but at the core the only thing that makes someone a Buddhist is if they follow the 8 fold path and strive to attain enlightenment Nothing like telling us to open our minds by telling us how to think.\\n\\n>Religion is evil and makes all its followers evil by extension. \\n\\nObjectively evil? I think you get a good idea about religion and beliefs when you watch the ending of Bhool Bhulaiya. Pretty good watch. Will recommend >\"be loyal to your species\" . What about other animals & beings dwelling this planet? Isn\\\\`t that the root cause of the problem, serving and taking care only for ones \"believed or look  like our own?  The foundation of all the evil you had pointed out above in the world religion, the selective goodness?\\n\\n A person with \"**kindness**\" as a dominant trait would shower it for everyone alike,  as a flower cant be selective in spreading its fragrance to  the audience of its choosing.\\n\\nHumans are consciously evolved beings, powered by probably the universes most sophisticated nervous system, & backed by a vast database of genome & cellular memories. \\n\\nThey can discern, choose consciously,  exert intent, they posses great will power, have the ability to introspect and make discoveries. \\n\\nThat innate power or toolkit is granted to almost every being born of the human womb. No matter the prevailing economic condition, race, geography, or any other external circumstances, this set of toolkit with optimum functioning is available to everyone by birth.\\n\\nExample, ever ask a child or toddler to kill a bird or conduct this act in-front of her, and it  would not matter which race or religion this child belongs to, they all will show a similar reaction, and express themselves similarly.\\n\\nThat\\\\`s the natures **\"inner toolkit**\" working providing hints to \"**right direction /Choices**\" \\n\\nYou see that every human is in possession of this toolkit, though a lot of us choose to forget using these over the time under the societal conditioning.\\n\\nWhich is sadly driven by the selfish principles like \"acting in pure self interest\" and taking care of those who look like us or believed to be of our own kind\"...\\n\\nThen why do you assert my friend,  that onus of all the wrong in the world is on the **religion(s)** and \"**historical humans**\" who said some words, or asked people like you and me to follow  a certain path.\\n\\nWhy not try and apply all these gifts of chromosomes inbuilt in us, to evaluate & choose for ourselves. Running their discourse on the logic, historical and geographical evidences, experiences and other tools available. - Scientific discovery essentially.\\n\\nAs far as all the misery of the world is concerned, root cause of it everywhere would be the individuals selfishness, and ignoring the hints provided by this inner toolkit. *aka, that faded voice from heart*\\n\\nWe under the influence of **selfishness enticed by greed** , ignored these hints from our innate toolkit, for so long that sadly it has stopped coming anymore for most part...\\n\\nSo, now we are left on the mercy of **\"Books\"**, **\" scriptures\"** and self proclaimed gurus... \\n\\nThere was a time when there were no books or written scriptures, everyone was relying on the **hints provided by this innate toolkit..**\\n\\nand then greed and selfishness flashed and some one, at some point, for the first time, must have dared to ignore the hints from inner toolkit and decided to chose otherwise.. That\\\\`s how it begin!\\n\\nRest copied, the trend followed and it took us all here... those opposed were ignored or crushed! This is what modern history tells us.\\n\\nThat\\\\`s how & (why must have )  written religious scriptures,  avatars, gurus,  happened on different point of this timeline of deliberate corruption  & suppression of **\"inner hints\"**\\n\\nThe scriptures and avatars are there to just to remind us humans that we possess a unique toolkit but we are forgetting to use it, and it is not good for us in the long term....\\n\\nYou see, all the religions on this planet in their depths have only pointed us humans to listen to  \"**this inner toolkit**\", where real knowledge happens.\\n\\nEventually, some day in the future, a majority of humans will find a way to pay attention to the hints coming from this inner toolkit. \\n\\nAnd all fake knowledge and religions creating illusion of different paths will collapse. As everyone would have the access to the truth and one end. \\n\\nIn nutshell, all the religion in their current format are serving a purpose, which is to guide humans to somewhere, point them in some direction, and alluring them to walk a path of their choosing...\\n\\nApparently, those who were entrusted with the authority to continue poke and remind humans about this core stuff  got corrupted themselves /Stopped listing to their inner toolkit..Some got hijacked (influence of greed / Self interest ) \\n\\nIn present format majority of these custodians of the original message are only disclosing what suits their interest.\\n\\nWhich is,  taking people to the different extended recursive paths while smartly hiding the essence.  Fitting their vested interests. \\n\\nAnd that\\\\`s causing all the confusion & creating this massive illusion that end destination is also a different place at the end of every path. \\n\\nYou would see...\\n\\nyet, IMO, every individual  still has got some access left to this toolkit. We all agree that everyone who lived in the end has to die. All path must converge to one. As all rivers of the world become one water in the vast ocean. \\n\\nThere are everyday experiences we chose to ignore. \\n\\nThose who would continue to ignore \"this hint from the inner toolkit\"  will continue to be confused and disillusioned... \\n\\n Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. \\n\\nEvil = Bad, and Right = Good  today are mere a label we put to our action based on its outcome. if they suit our interest, label it as good act, otherwise a bad one., isn\\\\`t so!\\n\\nDoes any other animal labels any of their act as a good or a evil ? \\n\\nAs evident from the above, all the labels of evil and good are inside us, this hint coming from \"**inner toolkit**\"  had always picked up the right label without a fail. Or else majority of humans would have been murderers, thieves,  and humanity would not have made this far!\\n\\nPoint is, that nothing is that bad externally, we have chose to ignore the majority of these inner hints as they contradict with our modern definition of good and bad. (Selective / always in self interest ) \\n\\nRecent population explosion across the globe has added mostly this \"type(s) of human\"  one heavily conditioned  with no support of this **\"inner toolkit\"** and hence all the chaos we see in the world, as no one has got a clue about what is right or wrong. It is pure selfishness and greed. \\n\\nIt is us as individuals, who need a fix. \\n\\nStart with giving importance to the hints originating from **\"Inner toolkit\"** which is far more superior and work of millennium of evolution. Sir, so how many pills did you say you have left? Sir...? I believe in Buddhism, not for the myths and legends, but for what it teaches and for its values. Do you think I\\'m \"stupid\" for believing so? No body else gonna mention how he said fuck Buddhism? But then proceeds to say that all that matters is lovong life in the moment on this earth?? THATS WHAT BUDDHISM IS ABOUT! Making the life you live HERE on EARTH as powerful and meaningful as possible. Do research before you spew hate filled shit all over things you dont even understand. Yeah I still believe in a rebirth sorry Religion is control “Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny.“\\n\\nSo free will? As it was written in the Bible.\\nAnd no one where in the Bible did it say we can’t advance as a species? \\n\\nAnd religion doesn’t divide us. It’s sin. Not being left, right, colored, poor, rich. It’s the sinful nature of mankind that fucks up the world. I don\\'t believe in religion, but I respect it, a good person is judged on how you treat others imo, I don\\'t need to believe in religion to accomplish that. Try to live your life as happy as possible, as a kid once said if you can\\'t be happy due to a disability, there is thousands of other things that can make you happy. RIP Sam Berns. Your thoughts are no different from those believing in a certain religion and is much closer to those which believe every other one is wrong. Being here in the now is pretty much the basis of all religion. Chill. Agree. You are kind if summarizing the teachings of Buddhism. K Fuck Prayer rooms. \\n\\nFuck Vaastu. \\n\\nFuck Beef Brigade. Tell me how did the universe start Why are you so mad I don’t understand why you are so upset. You’re kind of doing the same thing as religions would do which is telling people to leave their belief and join yours. Chill Religion =\\\\= spirituality. One can believe there is some higher power or energy without succumbing to an organized religion, and should not be judged or discriminated for doing so. Your first three paragraphs are just an angry version of the core teachings of Buddhism.\\n\\nNot sure what Buddhists your familiar with, but impermanence and understanding your connection to the universe is literally the closest thing to enlightenment words can describe.\\n\\nJust so you\\'re aware. People will find a way to divide without religion and I say that as an atheist. If you destroyed religion it would be race, if you destroyed race it would be nationalism, if you destroyed nationalism it would be ethnicity, then language, and so and so forth.\\n\\nHumans hate.  Religion didn\\'t make us do that.  Hell, many religions are actively trying to get us to stop.\\n\\nThe Nazis didn\\'t need religion to cause the holocaust, or Stalin the holodomor, or the Chinese the cultural revolution.\\n\\nHumans are the key shitty factor here, not religion. Religion doesn\\'t divide. It depends on who is using it for what ends. \\n\\nDon\\'t forget that the largest mass murders were committed by atheists: Mao and Lenin.\\n\\nAtheist governments can also manipulate humans to murder and hate others because of race, class, etc... Fuck i hope this coronavirus kills all the fucking oldies with their fortified faith in religion potentially bringing in better generation adults into play. Uhm ok? Yep. Couldn\\'t have said it better myself\\n\\nCheers I hope I am not too late.\\n\\nYou sure it\\'s just the religion?\\n\\nGod is dead by Nietzsche led to Nazism.\\n\\nFuck Nationalism https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=yq4uCWtQE24 lol just let people believe what they want But have you ever tried DMT? Be careful of making progress your religion No. There are SPECIFIC countries causing world unrest. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUSA (Christian)\\n\\nRussia (Christian)\\n\\nChina (Atheists) Does religion corrupt people or do people corrupt religion?\\n\\nI think people will find an excuse to be ignorant and shitty regardless of religion. If it wasn’t Jesus or Allah it would just be something else.\\n\\nLook at celebrities, famous youtubers, Trump, Bernie, Reddit, corporations, brands, computers, literally anything. People are willing to argue, preach, fight, and die for these with or without conventional organized “religion”.\\n\\nWho’s to say anything and everything isn’t already some form of “religion”.\\n\\nPeople created religion, not the other way around. Even if religion were to magically disappear today, I guarantee it would all start up again in a matter of days with essentially the same shit, just different names.\\n\\n“Religion” isn’t the problem, it’s people. ?????...... Who hurt you? While I dont disagree with the issues you speak of with religion and who believe it in, I dont believe anyone knows for sure what happens after death. So you really shouldnt say what happens after you die, cause you know...you don\\'t know either. I\\'d upvote for visibility but downvote for not realizing something simple. So no vote. Shouldnt this be on r/confessions I don’t believe in any god or have a religion but man, this post was just really edgy and kinda sad, just let people believe in stuff, as long as they aren’t hurting people Weird flex my atheist friend, people are gonna believe what they want to believe in. No ones certain where the soul/ conciseness goes when we die, so let us be creative, let us use some imagination. Is it really harming anyone, if it brings peace of mind to people of faith I don\\'t want to sound ironic but, you do know that atheism is technically a religion right?  this sounds like of a closed minded person who\\'s Seriously angry and can\\'t keep it to himself. I resent atheists but I don\\'t go around screaming it at the top of my lungs. 90% of adult life is learning how to bite your tongue and sit on your emotions, And this person sounds like he seriously failed at that. Reddit moment Religion is not perfect. People are not perfect.\\n\\n>If religion, instead of being the manifestation of a  spiritual ideal, gives prominence to scriptures and external rites, then  does it disturb the peace more than anything else.”\\n\\n– Rabindranath Tagore This ideology could be a religion in and of itself 0.0\\n\\nThe religion of non-religion. You have as much proof that God doesn\\'t exist then a religious person has that he does. That means zero. You have the right to believe whatever you want, and the right to not believe in anything. But your way of thinking isn\\'t superior to that of one who thinks God exists. This post is very condescending, narcissistic, and shows lack of open-mindedness rather than the intended open-mindedness. It\\'s very little and shows lack of character and a superiority complex. You\\'re not special, and neither are religious people. But what you are that most religious people are not, is disrespectful. I don\\'t it\\'s possible for our star to die in a supernova explosion. It\\'s too small. NOW WHAT!? You and your ilk have a warped concept of what religion is and its purpose. Religion does not establish a nation, it establishes an individual. It is the foundational practice of philosophies that is keeping you alive and making this shit post. All your plights about the history\\'s problems are a result of politics and the absence of religion. I predict your argument: \"look at all the nations and historical events predicated on religion\". Proceed to make that argument and make a fool of all yourselves. They way you spoke about religion was childish. I have to remind myself these are your beliefs or views that you are expressing here and good luck with that. Beautiful It’s crazy but Buddhists Christians Hindus and Jews all life in peace with one another. Didn\\'t read lol\\n\\nAre you one of those fedora-wearing neckbeards fighting fUnDiEs on the internet? Now that\\'s a sad, pointless waste of time Grumpy bear just joined the chat. *CRAWLIIIIIING INNN  MY SKIIIIIN* Coming from a religious guy, I feel like I’d rather be believing in something that isn’t true and spend my life optimistic for the future with no fear of death than to believe this is it and I’m just destined to be lifeless dust floating in space and who I am will be irrelevant when I die. Just seems depressing to live like that imo. Euphoric I believe in the New Game + Did anyone else read this as Eminem from  the movie 8-Mile\\n\\nFuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer,\\nfuck everybody\\nFuck y\\'all if you doubt me\\nI\\'m a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly\\n\\nAnd fuck this battle, I don\\'t wanna win, I\\'m outty,\\n\\nHere, tell these people something they don\\'t know about me. This website claims to be so accepting and then a post makes the front of Reddit that is basically straight up shitting on a large some of people that don’t live how the poster wants them to.\\n\\nYeah, you fuck off. Fucking hypocrites. We get it dude but seriously... /cringe Not religions fault if followers are idiots to begin with! What is your aim with this post? Any argument that starts with telling people to fuck themselves is going to create nothing but hatred. That\\'s not how you start a constructive conversation. Religion is a powerful thing created by geniuses among us use it wisely it can unit people of different cultures,Color,ideology etc but it can also can cause downfall of a civilisation . ok there goes reddit with its childish anti-religion atheistic boner. Seriously how many brains cell does one need to understand that its humans that are the fucking problem, that if there was no religion i guarantee we would FIND something else to muder each other over? Religion isn\\'t a bad thing. Religion doesn\\'t kill people. People kills people. Religion is just an excuse. Anyway, it\\'s not possible to say if gods exist or not. Just because they don\\'t interfere directly doesn\\'t mean that they don\\'t exist. I agree. But also, fuck India. What a terrible place Sorry I don\\'t have any condoms I agree religion shouldn\\'t be a thing, but you\\'re pushing your own beliefs onto others, saying that what they believe in is dangerous and wrong so they should change to your way of thinking instead. Which is what most religions out there do right now. Just saying. so answer why and how we exist? for what reason People like this act as though religion is the root of all evil. Even religion didn\\'t exist, we\\'d still fight and kill each other over race, sex, politics, sexuality, and money. \\n\\nBut sure, act as though we\\'d be a perfect society if it weren\\'t for one thing. Happy 14th birthday! I mean technically Buddhism is fine with atheism but go off. If it were not for various religions, people as a whole would have difficulty grasping concepts larger than their own life. If your life is being ruined by someone\\'s interpretation of a religion, blame them, not the religion. Ok 😐 Ok I don’t know OP sounds a little closed minded to me. Not advocating for blind faith without critical analysis. Just saying, sometimes there’s valuable information in things we don’t agree with or that don’t sit comfortably with us. edgy I\\'m amused that this is labeled as politics.\\n\\nNo it fucking isn\\'t. Religion is fiction. Ironic. If there is no God, why does anything you\\'ve said even matter? By who\\'s definition is any of it wrong or evil? I’m not up for extremism or violence through religion, but the amount of nihilism resonating from this post is way too much. You can’t lump all the followers with the ones who want to bring about viol and suffering Relax... You seem like a big fan of Ash Wednesday yes sir im on it Nah people are just terrible you don’t need a religion to do that That’s a nice belief you have.. Yo lmfao Religion is not the only things that divides us. So many other things like the color of our skin, sexuality, politics etc. Insults are never the way to convert people. That’s fine we are living in a simulation, so maybe after we “die” on Earth we’ll go to simulated heaven and see all our loved ones. You anti-religion people need to move on to simulation and higher powers in the universe - not a religious god - a higher evolved power that makes us look like amoeba. I don\\'t believe in any God but I respect the people who believe and have faith in supernatural powers. I know you want to say something good but you just sound like a toxic atheist that thinks that everyone who believe in higher powers are stupid. And religion in a lot of cases try to help people, christianism has some teachings, like helping the poor or to not judge others. I think that if people are happy thinking in a way no one should try to force their own beliefs into that person, you believe that there is no God, then be happy with it but don\\'t try to shame others for their religions. Science has given us comfortability and quality of living. It has not given us happiness. \\n\\nReligion, the realization and renunciation of the transient nature of our physical enjoyments will give us happiness. \\n\\nIt is no religion that takes from others, wants to change others, and hate others. There is no religion in blind faith. If it does not lead to love and charity it is not religion. \\n\\nThere are many organizations across the world that are sincere. Get to know these religions, not the humans who have perverted them. For starters, many Sikhs are beautiful. And I\\'d love to see you test your atheistic mettle against the Swamis of the Order of Ramakrishna. Some people are religious because of the off chance there is a god, and the eternity in heaven is worth being religious for. If there is a god, I’d be willing to tell him straight up to his face with no guilt, how shit a job he’s doing and that he should be ashamed of himself ! I am of the opinion that religion is a means to control the masses Fuck all atheists who claim to know the answers to the universe. \\n\\nYou are nothing more than claiming to be a secular prophet who “knows the truth of the universe”. Fuck outta here with your bullshit. Ah, Indian just like American, just pretending that the bad religious people you see on your street reflect all religious people worldwide, while it is just in specific countries where religious become violent. Imagine you are living in a world where no religious person ever had influence on your life and you have never ever seen any criminal or anti social act done by a religious person in the name of his religion. Guess what: I don\\'t hate religion. You know who I hate? People who do wrong, no matter if they are religious or not.\\n\\nI am atheist, but my mother is not, but she doesn\\'t believe in any religious bullshit, she is just a normal person who is by herself sure that there is a god, but she never wanted anything from me cause of that or others. Every time I see those hate posts about religions, I think about my mother, and question why people would wanna hate her? She is the most loving and caring person I ever met in my life, and my friends and visitors i get all approve that, especially her food ;). Can you imagine how that feel if someone says what your mother does is bad, although it isn\\'t? That is the key problem here, you are saying ALL religion, while you should be angry about the ACTIONS, hating religions means that you are not particular being angry about the ACTIONS that they have done to you, it means that you hate EVERYBODY of them, it means that you hate those WHO NEVER had harmed anybody, who never had imposed their religion on others.\\n\\nYou say to fuck a group of people where there are a majority who have never done anything wrong. And now those people can use that as argument against you, cause you are not particular pointing those things out that are missing in your country WHICH EXIST IN OTHER COUNTRIES, like CLEAR splitting of religion and government. You have practical no idea how life is in a country with splitting of religion and government, AND STILL, you want to hate _ALL RELIGION_, which means you are also hate those people here in Germany who follow a religion that never influenced their life or the life of others. This is despicable and actually helps those people who are really wrong, who abuse religion to get into power who abuse religion to stay in power, cause they just can point to the harmless people an d say \"Why you hate those?\"\\n\\nYou are literally hating people for the actions of others, which is the same as racist do. You are like a racist cause you are not pointing to those who did wrong, you point to ALL and say they are all wrong, cause of the actions of other people. All this hate in the world is just disgusting. Be ashamed, inform yourself about the world, and start liking the good parts and pointing to the bad parts, and not point to parts which are used for good and bad in the world just because you are too stupid to open your eyes.\\n\\nI also want to point out: Isn\\'t it funny how you describe how people should be living together and reflect in those sentences the way religion is used in modern civilization, in those countries which split religion from government. It is kinda disturbing that you have no idea how the world rotates and believe everybody is living in a shithole where religious people take action in the society. Just disturbing and totally stupid to fire up broadsword against people you do not even know, you have no experience with, you just know those in your shithole, but want to condemn those in other countries without even knowing how they are doing in other countries.\\n\\nI hope you get the hate you spread. Fuck you. It\\'s like blaming on the gun and not the shooter. People (most of them) follow religions as a discipline. However, there are some those who create division and unrest. Best thing is to avoid them. How the fuk do you know pal ? I don’t think religion is the problem, it is humanity that is messed up. Getting mad at religion can be easy, but if you want to be more accurate the issue lies a mother step wider, namely our tribalistic tendencies and power struggles. It just so happens that religion is one form that had been more visible, but more recently blaming religion just sounds like going backwards into more tribalism which is the real issue. Intriguing!! In this entire barb, it is about \"you\" and \"your\". \\nBro, are you the next enlightened one, lookout for followers??\\nAnyhow, for the rest, this video should be helpful:\\n\\n[Why religious beliefs are not silly?](https://youtu.be/pLj4iwa0__8) You dont know anything son! Let people believe what they want to believe. Atheism are for the weak, lazy and nihilism that wants to justify their depression, hatred for life, antinatalism and laziness on the fact that we don\\\\`t matter, we are just matter and that nothing matters. It is the coward way to rationalize one\\'s own failure. Wants proof? Atheists have the highest suicide rate than any religious group by far. Failing to coping with depression leads to atheism. It is short-sighted to be so sure in what happens beyond death. We know nothing of our consciousness and it\\'s impossible to say what happens when we die. I am against all religions, but the way that you are so sure of something that science knows nothing about comes close to just another form of religion to me. Agnosticism might be a better way. *claps in american* Fuck India Try some dmt.\\n\\nYou\\'ll eat your views on what you think \"the big picture\" is.\\n\\nAll in all, your view that there\\'s nothing else out there, is just as arrogant and \"silly\" as all those organized religions put together.\\n\\nIt\\'s comical, the irony... Fuckkkk religion they should all burn anyways. A very uninformed understanding of what religion is, although I agree with and empathize with all of your sentiments. Thank you for this! Couldn\\'t agree more\\n\\nThe only reason I can think of for believing in religion is hope. (Old people and the fear of dying, drug addicts that need something to hold onto or people that have had a bad time) Religion is the main cause of unrest worldwide*\\n\\nFixed Man, your life truly sounds like it sucks. If someone believes in something and it gives them a better quality of life, then fuck you for saying they can’t. You suck. >Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism.\\n\\nThank God I\\'m a Pagan I\\'m definitely not religious, but we should let people believe in what they want. Maybe the reason they hold on to their beliefs is because they are scared of dying or it makes them feel safe, cause fuck man death is scary. I know people say they aren\\'t afraid of death, but I find that to be bullshit because I bet when you are sitting right in front of death then we will all be shitting our pants. \\n\\nI definitely don\\'t agree with religious people who push their beliefs on us, but it doesn\\'t mean I should tell them their beliefs are dumb because it\\'s what comforts them. I mean who are we to take others comfort and safety away. \\n\\nReligion can be evil if used by the wrong people, but for many they only use it to do better. \\n\\nAlso, if we are all insignificant in the grand scheme of things then why give a fuck about anything at all especially something like religion. Just let people live their lives and do your own thing. Hahaha, what a sad edge-lord. I’ll pray for you even though you’re one of those radical atheists who are as equally stupid as their radically religious counterparts.\\n\\nAtheists are always full of themselves claiming an open mind and being woke, when really they are just as oblivious. You’re pathetic at the moment, but hopefully you will find some clarity soon.\\n\\nYou can learn from anything. It really isn’t a big deal. People mostly do it because of the chance that there is god. If there isn’t then oh well. r/copypasta What a bunch of terrible and hateful logic by a young teen, people are actually at their most evil without religion, recourse, or law. 150+ million dead to atheistic ideologies by Pol Pot, Stalin, and Mao. Edgy. Cool to know you hold all the answers of the universe. It’s ok to have faith. It’s ok to be afraid of death. It’s ok to congregate with your community. It’s ok to celebrate your culture. It’s religion and it’s rules and outdated beliefs that you do not need. Fuck Reditism Atheists are weak willed people and immoral people that thinks that just because the universe is big it means sentient life doesn\\'t matter. Atheism is the first step to sociopathy and later to psychopathy. I am glad i saw the light and converted from atheism to christianity some time ago Religion, much like various cultures, are constructed based on the reigning norms and values of that society. However much like various cultures, they eventually obscelesse. I just hope the whole world one day will say this Calm down, my friend. Technically being atheist is also a religiou Breaking news as /r/India suddenly becomes /r/atheism from 10 years ago Yeah, I remember when I was 14 Lmao if I said that my parents they would whoop my ass, I somewhat do agree with you tho. I agree but also believe that money is a big contributor to what\\'s holding back humanity. Because it creates greed. If we could just worked together as one people we could contribute so much more to the world and the future of humanity as a whole. You should join my cult. You know what I figured out? Gods are that imaginary friend you need support from when you\\'re going through hard times. \\nThat\\'s it. The whole thing is based around this Says the curry eater It’s been about a decade since I’ve become non-religious, but this type of stuff gets on my nerves. You explain how little value human life has and proceed to make the argument that religion has ended countless lives. I promise you, we are just as clueless, our actions just as arbitrary, and our minds are just as closed, if not more, than the most religious people on Earth. Sir this is a Wendy’s\\n\\n\\n(also what’s up with reddit and religion hating neck beards?) You can\\'t force someone to leave their religion. I see a lot of anger in your post. You say God is not real. I understand where you\\'re coming from. A lot of people use religion as justification or reasons for doing something or not doing something. The real answer is this: life is empty and meaningless. Does this mean God isn\\'t in your life? Maybe. Religion doesn\\'t start violence. Interpretation of religion does.\\n\\nYou say with full conviction that there is nothing after death.\\n\\nHave you ever died before???\\n\\nWhat you wrote is just your opinion not fact and a total bulshit.\\n\\nRead Bible, Kuran, Gita. Hopefully, it will open your mind. [removed] There’s really nothing wrong with Buddhism, They don’t even believe in a god, it’s a nice religion( more of just a way of life tho), it doesn’t really belong in this category with the others lol On which premise we base morality? Why not suicide and bring it all with you? >Awww so badass\\nAbe Facebook pe post kar na dum hai toh lmao\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n>He got gold, silver and all that too\\nHe\\'s preaching to people who already do that\\n\\n>That\\'s like me telling you not follow modi\\nIf he was discussing religion like we do then it would have been okay.\\n\\n\\n>But preaching to them ki \"fuck your religion\"\\nArey Reddit pe vaise he naastik baithe hain\\n\\nYe sab aap apne relatives se boliye na If you think the religionists have fucked up the most, wait till you read what the godless (read communists) have heaped on the world. At the end of the day, humans are bad for humanity. The conventional wisdom of bad vs good and evil vs good are blase. The politics of religion (or its absence) is the root cause of all these evils. Forget about religion, forget about spirituality, enjoy your moment under the sun as the only continuum, then you are safe from all fears and fearmongering. I would argue that religion is not what causes problems, stagnant civilizations, wars and murders. Bigotry is. People kill each other because of the unwillingness to accept that the other guy has just as much right to believe what they believe. Silence stagnates when people are unwilling to be open to new ideas. Cultures divide when we can\\'t accept differences. Bigotry is not unique to religion. So I would argue, let\\'s address the real enemy or else it will perpetuate even if all religions die off. Dude, you tell me to open your mind and \"come back to the real world\". Your real world sucks ass. It\\'s a fallen world. This isn\\'t the true world. It\\'s apparent you need to open your mind. \\n\\nAlso, isn\\'t this an abuse of rule 3? This is literally hate mongering. WORD!!! Some people literally need religion because they have nothing else and wouldn\\'t be able to cope with their reality otherwise. Well, you\\'re going to be foaming out the mouth when you learn about Baha\\'i.\\n\\nNot Indian, just saw this on r/popular, but: fuck you. Scapegoating is wrong. Very mature and elegant. wow you are so cool retard You make atheism sounds so twatish though. Not a coincidence that [most psychopaths are atheist](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/health/atheists-religion-study.amp.html) \\n\\nKeep your science fairy tale to yourself. Your weak theory (which is what it is, a theory) of the Big Bang is from a cult leader. But have yall ever tried DMT tho? Looks like somebody just finished reading Sapiens I was once an aethist, now agnostic. \\nYou cannot blame religion based on what people do. Want to know what Islam is? Read Quaran, want to know what Hindusim is? Read Vedas, Gita, and scriptures. Read Bible to know what Christianity preaches.\\nPeople are trash, they never go beyond their ignorance. \\nReligion is not a set of rules, it\\'s a lifestyle. Non religion preaches hate and bigotry. \\nIt\\'s people who use religion as a weapon. \\nAs far as I have studied hinduism it goes way beyond life and death. From Ayurveda to astronomy from philosophy to physiology every aspect is covered regarding human life and death and beyond. We need to clear the fog. Religion is a set of rules and a moral compass to follow when you feel like you can\\'t handle a situation alone. What you see on TV isnt religion. What you see people murder each other over isn\\'t religion. It\\'s sad and I hate it. Religion is something personal between you and the world we live in. You speak too much for a person who knows too little. /r/im14andthisisdeep Lol some kind of a fucking pathetic simp got mad when he lost a game of fortnite. Go fuck urself 14 yrs old kid I\\'m literally scrolling through Popular and came across this. Dafuq is going on in India? You can disagree but....damn dude, chill Fuck you. Cringe. Couldn\\'t have said it better Imagine having.your wife burned because you.died before her Yea let people have their thing but leave me out of it.  I know but i don’t care. Fuck people who don\\'t believe in a higher power. Amen! Hello from America, I feel the exact same way. Really no need to come at religion with you uninformed opinion because your insecure about yourself. Pledge your hearts to Satan my fellow heathens. If you think like that why even keep living? This post did not make me leave my religion. Islam teaches good manners, its brought me love and respect. Contentment without jealousy. Even if you don\\'t believe in the afterlife (which you can\\'t disprove either) the teachings alone are worth passing down. I think my favorite part is “nothing divides us expect religion” except ya know politics, cultures, personal beliefs on how to live, shall I go on this is a really poor argument on your part. Read The Law of One. \"Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.\"\\n\\nHow do you know that\\'s what happens? The old “I don’t agree so fuck you argument”. Why does crap like this get so many likes? Edgy and soypilled Raised in the church, left the church tne slowly re read the bible after a bunch of philosophers (athiests) quoted certain bits.   \\n\\n\\nCertainly dont think its all great but many good tales and lessons in there with god excluded. & i would add suicide rates are much higher amongst athiest communities than not. You forgot to fuck judism. Edit ur post. Buddhism actually isnt a religion. Side note it’s been conferred by scientist many times that theirs a grand being responsible for our creation on top of thousands of other arguments that just completely invalidates you argument, better luck next time.  The only reason I can think of for believing in religion is hope. very reddit of you Ok mr athiest r/im14andthisisdeep I\\'m waiting for this to become a copypasta. Let me remind you that Zionism was founded by an atheist ((Theodor Herzl) and this same ideology uses religion in many context to justify its relevance! Spare us your BS and start advocating for atheism when atheists come up with something constructive, not an ideology that created the most twisted society and an apartheid entity! \\n\\nYour use of science to promote atheism is just but a trick to give your idea some credibility! It works with some but not with all! Let’s go Judaism >Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species.\\n\\nWHITE POWER! My biggest problem with religion is how so many of them clearly push the message across that we are all equal/treat others how you wish to be treated. But the majority case is, we are all equal, unless you\\'re a woman, non-hetrosexual, from a foreign country or believe in a different religion. Religion is the main cause for division in the world, Christians hating muslims, jews fighting islamics, and so much more. On top of this the catholic and Christian churchs(maybe others too?) have been massive door stops in the evolution of scientific research. I support the peace religion tries to express, but the methods are far too skewed. Fuck buddhism ?\\n\\nFor what ? I\\'m an occultist Wow very well written and I couldn’t have said it better myself! It makes me angry that I’m in my 20s and my mom still tries to force religion on me saying that I got the good job I have now because of god...no mother I got it because of ME because I worked hard and got it.  Stop giving god all the credit and understand I made it happen.  The way she talks about god and religion would shock you.  Its as if she’s convinced everything in the Bible is the truth and she even said no one’s going to convince her otherwise.  But it’s sad because she’s been abused by different people nearly her whole life, doesn’t like where she is now and that’s why she needs to hold on to religion.  She just wants somewhere to belong and to hold onto.  I just can’t wait until the day we all die and realize there’s nothing.  I wish I’d be able to see the look on her face. Imagine thinking you know anything The word religion. There are so many interpretations of that word. There is the Catholic religion, the Christian, the Protestant and the innumerable divisions of Protestantism, and there is Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhs and so on. So many religions in the world, organised, some are brutal, the Islamic world and so on. So what do you consider is religion, the word? Is it the search for human beings something outside of their own daily life, something other than their petty self-centred activity, beyond their cruelty, bestiality and their vulgarity and all the rest of that? Is it that human beings have always sought from the most ancient of times something beyond themselves? If we consider that, something beyond themselves, beyond their daily life, then that becomes a religion of escape, which probably most religions are, as they are now. It is not connected with their daily existence. It is based on belief, on a book, or on faith, or on some dogma, rituals, the repetition of daily rituals which goes on practically all over the world - incense, dressing up, fancy dress and all that. All that, prayer included, is called leading a religious life, going, as they do in India at one time three times a day to the temple, and the Islamic world five times prayer, and the Sunday mass and so on. So this is considered religious, or rather a religious attitude. We are questioning that.\\n\\nI would like rather to question the whole nature and the structure of present day religion. There are so many sects. They have found that Christianity is very limited, so they go off to Buddhism, or to some kind of sectarian gurus and so on, the multiplication of this search for something other than the daily boredom, daily loneliness, the constant conflict and so on. This has been the pattern. - Jiddu Krishnamurti \\n\\n\\nhttps://jkrishnamurti.org/content/what-religion-you/Religion%20 Amen! God isn’t your imaginary friend, he’s your imaginary enemy.\\n\\nAn Imaginary Friend is a friend who will listen to your troubles, and are the only kind of friends I have. Oh, it wouldn\\'t feel like r/popular if there wasn\\'t at least one post bashing on religion. I’ve noticed most non religious or anti religious people I’ve met have one thing in common: they are not okay with the idea of having no control of their lives. They want to have full control and refuse to give that up. \\n\\nBut we don’t... and that’s just how life is. God (or whoever/whatever you believe in) forbid you or I or anyone experiences the loss of someone and we really can’t do much to ABSOLUTELY avoid Or prevent it. \\n\\nWe have to think more positively. You don’t have to believe, but you can at least respect the fact that others do. \\n\\nWe can’t control what happens in life, but we are given full control of how to react to it. I wish I could upvote this 5000 times! Seems to me like you speak the language of your colonizers. Look deeper, think deeper. When did these problems begin? Don’t look for scapegoats. What messed you up isn’t religion, it is an agenda that was put in place before you ever graced this planet. Religion can bring good of it is used properly, look at Martin Luther King Junior or Malcolm X. Faith gave strength to people long before you, but you spout what your colonizers brainwashed you with. Wake up. Don’t think you are better than anyone else or that you have it all figured out. Atheism is also a religion, don’t delude yourself, because you read a few books or watched some TedTalks meant to influence people into leaving their creed and the only thing that comforts them. It is the settler/colonial system that makes us hate one another, because it’s easier to divide us to conquer us. k Like it or not, freedom of speech and freedom of thought is a double edged sword. I understand where your frustration stems from. I want to rid this country of divisive thoughts as much as you do. But we have to be better than them. We cannot speak in the same tone as they do. We have to stand up for our rights and rights of people that we don\\'t agree with. That is the price of democracy. imo religion has always been a \\'law\\' of sorts to govern the poor and uneducated back when it was established. \\n\\nI don\\'t mind ppl who feel the need to find a belief or escape. it becomes a problem when it\\'s an obsession, or wrong interpretation of the overall meanings or forcing an interpretation onto others. \\n\\nreligion should not be more than 10% of your life. Ok mom Interesting... \"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism.\" but you failed to mention Judaism... Seems like just an advertisement for another sub. Some of you guys make religion sound like the root of all evil, while terrible things have been done in the name of religion in the past there are plenty of good religious people who have helped society in a literally uncountable amount of ways lol the sun won\\'t blow into a super nova. Religion was more powerful in the past. It\\'s more about money now. Wealth is the divider these days. Humanism is it’s own religion. Buddhism is not a religion As if humans needed Religion to commit atrocity in the name of a \"cause\"...for all your scientific theory you seem to understand very little about human nature.\\n\\nReligion isn\\'t the \"cause\" of anything it\\'s a *tool* occasionally used by w/e \"powers\" as a convienent form of manipulation based in fear. Religion is factually nothing but a set of beliefs...general beliefs can and do exist outside of such constructions & would easily take it\\'s place manifest in some other form.\\n\\nI\\'m not religious but this seems (objectively) to be little more than an emotionally rooted kneejerk to pin the tail on a target for some personal pain. There is no god and I am his prophet right? In the name of religion a lot of people were killed agreed.\\n\\nThe epitome of scientific advancement contributed by the best scientists of the time, led to the invention of Nuclear weapons that killed a lot too.\\n\\nSo now are you going to say science is bad because people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were killed? No, you would tell , science was used for the wrong purpose.\\n\\nSame way, it\\'s simple. When religion is used for wrong reasons, wrong things can happen.\\n\\nBeautiful communities are formed through religion too, there is unity too.. it\\'s not always fight between religions or for a religion.\\n\\nMy opinion is we should look at a bigger picture and be more considerate.\\n\\nHave a good day. “Fuck Buddhism”\\n\\n“You are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is bigger than you could fathom”\\n\\n[???](https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/46407983/Nick-Young) question, what drives your morality if you believe all will be dust in the end? Religion and it’s values, belief and fear in a higher power are what have brought society to where it is today. I’m non religious myself but you sound like an angsty teenager who thinks he’s found the solution to world peace. Spoiler alert, it’s not that simple and you’re not that smart or original for thinking it All religion will fuck you in return. People believe because idea of life being just this and that we are only one responsible for what we are doing scare the shit out of them. They rather believe in higher plan and some almighty overseer. I remember when I was 12. Weeb Wow so euphoric. Well to be fair buddhism isn\\'t really a religion... It\\'s really about just being more in tune with yourself and your community. It\\'s more of a philosophy like taoism or confucianism. Edgy Fuck all religion. All hail economic ideologies 100% Cool story bro. So edgy. Religion isn’t bad *per se*. It’s been a thing since the primitive man was thinking. Modern religion is not the same as it was in the beginning; it was a way to ascend man to a cosmic level, to live forever, and many more things. Nowadays it’s just a vestige of that, stopping progress and shit. \\nI would not call them “childish beliefs”, true religion is a beautiful and interesting thing as seen from a anthropological and psychological perspective. \\n\\nReligion as economics and imposition is another thing. >A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa.\\n\\nNo. The fossil record has been updated more than once.\\n\\nhttps://www.natureasia.com/en/nmiddleeast/article/10.1038/nmiddleeast.2018.15 Religion does suck. I don\\'t believe in \"God\" but I don\\'t hate on others for it. Live and let live type of thing. When it encroaches on my space I make it very clear that I would like no part of it. Mainly because nobody knows and therefore they are talking out of their ass. Hoes mad Let people believe what they want, if they’re not hurting anyone then why does it matter? This is exactly why I detest atheists. I don’t have a religion, I follow my own belief. But by far this absolutely harsh ideology is forcing your own beliefs just as others forced theirs on you. It makes you no better than them, and to be honest everyone needs to understand it’s not okay to force your beliefs on others.\\n\\nThat’s all that needed to be said, not this rant that slams and insults people that have done nothing to you. I can counter argue that those in some religions would likely have a less brute force approach and not be so callous and reckless with their words. Words hurt others, words start wars, words are like the bullets that provide ammo for evil and tyrannical agendas. \\n\\nTake a step back and realize you have no control, this shout into the void is useless. You’re doing it for comfort or recognition which is only temporary in the grand scheme of things. Applause fades, the curtains close, and you’re left standing there feeling good about yourself for the wrong reasons. \\n\\nThe best way to detest religion is not to recognize them at all or give the energy you have up in an attempt to put them “on blast” so to speak. You don’t believe, good for you, many others are like you. But just because you don’t believe doesn’t mean others CAN’T believe. Stop trying to cause a stir in such a rude and disrespectful way out in the open and instead find a way to put that energy into something that will actually make a difference.\\n\\n\\nHave a great day. I think you got the date wrong about when we left Africa Good on you for you opinion. I\\'m no motherfucking devout religious sanyasi but hey atleast I don\\'t write conceited posts shitting on other people\\'s beliefs. Everyone\\'s opinion is just as valid as yours. You\\'re an atheist? Great. Good on you. Some people are Christians, some Hindus. Good on them too. Having different opinions doesn\\'t make you superior to anyone. Fuck buddhism? I have always believed and always will that humans are meant to work together and the only legacy that matters is the one where you\\'ve ensured some kind of positive change for the future of our species. If nothing matters and we’re all going to die anyway who cares if some people are religious. shut up cracker You are free to believe or not believe in whatever you want, but this is such a boiled down to nothing take. You act like being a good Samaritan and advancing society is not possible while being religious, which is super dumb. You arent that smart for throwing out human history and the way u frame it makes you sound like a 13 year old white kid who doesnt have a lot to offer besides condescending snide comments; that and you come off as zelous and insane as the preachers and religious leaders of older times that ostracised and killed others for following their own practice( in your case lack of practice). Again you are free to put your time and faith in anything u want, religion or science, but you make non religious science praising athiests sound real dumb. Could use with a touch of less unnecessary nihilism and a \"nothing matters i a cog in the machine of the universe\" air to your ideas, cuz you are defintely not keeping an open mind. Based Live and let live. That is why we has this beautiful thing called freedom of religion in America. If someone\\'s beliefs do not directly impact you, live at peace with them. Just as vehement as you are atheist, there are the same who are religious. You are not entitled to be right just because you are upset that people think differently. Grow up, and realize that people have the right to believe what they want, despite how upset it makes you. You are not preaching love, you are preaching hate of people who view the world differently. We are not all the same (genetics will tell you that). Religion is the real world, as it is ingrained within cultures throughout the world. People have believed in a creator for thousands of years. If it makes you feel better to be an atheist, more power to you. But do not tell me (or anyone else) how to live their lives, because in effect, you are doing EXACTLY that which you are criticizing. My 2 cents\\n\\nI don\\'t even know where to begin. Further more, I think that most don\\'t realise the kind of argument you guys are putting forth.\\n\\nI kinda understand where this thought begins but tbh it is just as good as any other scapegoat. We are so desperate to find a solution out of the misery and problems we are surrounded by that we make another scapegoat. The way in which responses are written in this thread shows the other bitter side of the coin.\\n\\nFrom a completely neutral point of view, advocating for the removal of religion is as radical of an idea as some religion advocating for the banishment of the other religion (like what you see in the events unfolding). BUT wait... you could say, I as a non-religious \"unbiased person\" am seeking betterment for the society (I will overlook the way everyone on this thread places moral anchorage as if something like that even exists in this viewpoint - \"good and bad?\" What are those terms?), anyway, back to the point, you have done the same by placing yourself on a false pedestal dictating the terms and the way you present them as absolute.\\n\\nSo...\\n\\nWhat is the true solution if you want to dismantle any , and I mean any false beliefs?\\nSimple - Engage in discussion and do not throw some belief out of the window or portray it as radical just because you don\\'t like it. This way, we can have a society that actually progresses by engaging with the other and not by \"marginalising\" the other. Calling our groups to hate and laugh on the ideas of the other can also not lead to a harmonious society. Remember, you can come to similar terms on many issues by talking and listening to the other with an intent to understand\\n\\nPEACE and I\\'m out Bruh for an ideology that doesn\\'t belive in something they sure also hate it a lot. Nice opinion bruh. Don’t forget the most common modern religion to take over; Scientism. People think science will save humanity as much as a Omnipotent being will. You could easily replace the views of former generations of “don’t worry god will save us” with the modern view of “don’t worry science will save us”. Most people don’t realize the concepts are exactly the same. Also the same as UFO believers. “Don’t worry aliens will save us”. \\n\\nWe’ve not grown spiritually at all in the last 1k years and I would argue we have digressed. You can see even you the op have your bias toward science in your post. Belief in science can be just as dangerous and honestly are exactly the same as belief in religion.\\n\\nThere’s nothing wrong with any of the views to be honest though. You don’t really hate religion, as they all serve a purpose. You hate peoples need to push their views on others and the childish behavior of always having to be right no matter the logic. Fuck that immature view instead! Well said. Show me on this teddy bear where the priest touched you Hey i hate religion and think it should be totally abolished. But you don’t know what happens when we die and it’s annoying when atheists say shit like “you know happens when we die, we just black out and that’s it”.\\n\\nYes we know what will happen to your body but no one knows what does it could happen when we die. It’s the one question we may or may never get answered. I\\'m not a believer myself, but shitting on someone else\\'s belief is not cool man, not cool. You think you sound reasonable, but your tone mirrors that of an extremist in a religious sect. Sounds like a budding daoist to me. For all we have is reality, cast aside everything but reality. This is what I believe in!! I absolutely despise religious beliefs for the sole reason that in a country like India , in today\\'s time, people go around wearing this tag of \\' I am a ___\\' and ask others about their religious beliefs...and like in my family being atheist is like being arrogant like wtf?! My mom is a hardcore religious person and I am a hardcore atheist Bec of all the madness that goes around in the house under the name of this so called fucked up religion. \\nI believe in Energy that thrives in the universe and of course KARMA ;-) Lol yo chill Fuck religion. Nice post Most religions that exist today (100s of them) don\\'t even believe in the afterlife, so their point has nothing to do with death or immortality. Religions are made because the humans needed hope. The hope, that all of this has a meaning. They needed a guide how to behavior in life, to find peace in the death. But greed corrupted it, the humans themself did it, and if there is a god or more, humans wouldn‘t be able to life by their wills without corrupting it. Today, it‘s a tool to control the masses. But how do you know that you blackout and cease to exist after death? Calling all religion childish for what they believe of the afterlife and then imposing you know exactly what happens after death is arrogance. You\\'re no better than the very thing you\\'re complaining about.\\n\\nUltimately no one knows what happens after death and no one will ever be able to know until you die yourself. So what\\'s wrong with hoping for something peaceful, especially when the entire concept of non existence is an unknown and scary thought to the vast majority. A good friend of mine who I care for has anxiety attacks from just thinking of this concept of unending blackness of nothingness. So what\\'s wrong with finding peace in thinking of something different?\\n\\nPersonally I\\'m agnostic. Because theres no way to know, I dont think its logical to claim anything with certainty solely based off what anyone believes is true. But I dont think theres anything wrong with hoping for peace in the afterlife especially if it gives you peace of mind while you\\'re alive.\\n\\nEdit: After reading through the rest of your post I agree with mostly everything else, but i still dont think it\\'s right to generalize religion like that. I agree the extreme side of religion is bad. There is a problem with anything when it turns into tribalism. Or when it makes people ignorant and unable to live in reality. But if people are keeping to themselves and helping others find peace in some way, then I see nothing wrong. Especially when there are a lot of good churches who help those in need with their personal problems, somewhat in the same way as therapy. Not only that but there are a lot of good messages that some churches preach, that dont necessarily even have anything to do with religion but are just simple messages of be a good person and love one another. Add caste to the list too.. That bullshit needed to be banished long ago... At this point it\\'s more dangerous than a bad of heroin Post this on r/theydidthefuckyou What if I told you figuring out how to behave is way harder than knowing how from the start I am 31 and still recovering from the damage Christianity has done to me since I was a child.  One of the most unfortunate parts of religion is that it allows people to not take responsibility for the bad AND the good things that happen in life. It becomes a problem when you attribute all of your successful decisions in life as “the hand of god” because you never quite feel powerful enough to reach your fullest potential and happy self.   Like you couldn’t possibly have done well without help from some external force that’s smarter and braver than you.  They literally take children, break down their self esteem and make it so that the only people who can understand you are the other people in their loony bin called the church.  I once told my mother that using religion to raise your children is cowardly and lazy.  She didn’t take that very well.  \\n        When you get out of religion like I did, initially you are free and relieved. But then you struggle immensely dealing with reality.  No one ever taught you how to deal with your emotions properly and it takes a long time to appreciate living in doubt and uncertainty.  You spent all of your important developing years being brainwashed.   Religion is fucking evil.  It is for the weak and mentally ill.  Don’t let anyone tell you any differently. hey fuck you too As an atheist I agree with much of what you have written, though your grammar needs a bit of work. \\nBut many of your statements are inaccurate: just because some aspects of this life and death are unknown at this time does not mean we will not discover their underlying truths in the future.\\nHowever, your self-righteous attitude is not one that will succeed. Calling to religious believers\\' attention the myriad wrongs of religion will not convince them to seriously consider your argument.\\nAnd why should they?\\nPlease think about this: most humans who have lived, or are now living, have an overriding goal in life to live as long and as happily as possible. \\nSo there you stand on a street corner waiting for the walk signal with an elderly person. When the two of you begin to cross the street, are you going to take away your fellow traveler\\'s crutches and state they should not be used because you don\\'t need them?\\nThough certainly far from perfect, religion helps millions of good people get along in this world. Who are we to deny them their peaceful and often kind and thoughtful way of living? 100 % agree. why do u guys send unwanted dick pics to everyone Copypasta Trump visits India.\\n\\nReddit: fUcK iNdIa AnD yOuR rElIgIoN! I use to believe exactly the same shit you do...use to...and now that I know the truth, I feel bad for you I don\\'t believe in religion but everyone believes in something.\\nSome believe in money, some believe in science and some in religion.\\nThe issue is not in believing something but imposing your beliefs on others. The expectation that everyone around you should believe in the same thing is what\\'s causing the unrest in India. AND FUCK ATHEISM. Just live and let live. Wow! You have it all figured out. You should write about your wisdom, share it and gather followers. Temper temper. Religion or not, man is evil, does evil. Sure, people are good and do good too but left unchecked, without the God(s), Man will revert to bestiality. The common law and government only work when everybody buys into it.  Which is why we need schools, to ensure everybody buys into it from an early age.\\n\\nOtherwise the idea that one can own property is meaningless fiction. But we strive toward that fiction and it is the basis for our society. More property, more status, more wealth, more police to safeguard it, more military to ensure outsiders don\\'t claim it, and more religion to propagate the myth that God wants this.\\n\\nBut whether there is a God or not, whether it cares or not, is up for debate. What is not is that people left unchecked will always result in them exploiting others in whatever form s/he can for their own benefit. God, as we commonly imagine, possibly is an Alien. Wow.  Breakin new ground there..... Ok streetshitter Cringe atheist Gonna cut yourself on all that edge u/koalakitty84 Ok I don’t believe in religion. But I believe there were civilization on our planet about 12-15k years ago. We were advanced enough to build pyramids and many other megalithic things. \\n\\nWe were a global civilization, but some natural disaster happened. 90% of the population got wiped out. We started from ground zero being cave man again. All the amazing technology became stories, and stores became legends and some became religions today The first perpetrator of religion has blood of millions soaked in his hands. Dude. I say this shit all the time. It’s all made up bullshit. Except I don’t get a thousand rewards for it. > Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.\\n\\n\\nMy only serious question for you is this:\\n\\nHow do you know? Preach man I strongly disagree, but respect your right to hold that opinion; and see no reason why we couldn’t get along. \\n\\nSee? We’re not so bad :p 100% agree edgy teenager alert H.P. Lovecraft\\'s entire horror is based on the idea that human existence is insignificant. Why do atheists love to trot this idea out like its a good thing? Not sure if religion is bad in its entirety.But, what I\\'m sure about is that it\\'s being misused for gains. That\\'s the real issue. Education might be one of the potent solutions. Christian here, I have a couple of questions.\\n\\nWhy does religion mean close minded?\\n\\nWhy does religion mean evil?\\n\\nYou say that after we die nothing happens. Have you experienced death before to back up your claim? Just because a religion is responsible for a war doesn\\'t mean all religious people deserve to be hated. How can you be so sure there is no afterlife when you haven\\'t experienced death yourself?\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I believe the same as you, but you can\\'t just say you\\'re right just because you think it is the most logical answer. All I see when I read this is arrogance and nonacceptance of a societal norm that isn\\'t going to go away if you insult it. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  said :\\n\\n“If religion becomes a cause of dislike, hatred and division, it were better to be without it, and to withdraw from such a religion would be a truly religious act”. Angry Redditor is angry at religion. Then again what do you know? Fuck nationalism! This dude would be in nazi germany and say fuck you to the jews Damn, I\\'m an Atheist but let people believe in what they want bro. Sounds like OP read the book \\'Sapiens\\' You couldn’t be more right. I agree but Buddhism shouldn’t be grouped with any of those. Especially Abraham if religions. Buddhism is more of a mindset than a religion. I trust in God. Still. Hey, if you are feeling this way reach out to like minded people. You\\'ll feel just slightly better I promise. > [DISCOVER YOUR TRUE IDENTITY](https://youtu.be/Rf3HR6bAd4Y)\\n\\n[Breaking India](https://youtu.be/mTCMRRotCA4) [Forces](https://youtu.be/LLZeGNPVJNc): [the Abrahamic](https://youtu.be/UI2tRm7cf8U) [LW & RW](https://youtu.be/YMR6lM7tTNc) [dichotomy](https://youtu.be/HKKFMo89QgM) [rooted in](https://youtu.be/iDbH3QomBmg) [an authoritarian-totalitarian](https://youtu.be/IX-s0evYaLs) [history-centric](https://youtu.be/_0TwOogvMWA) [exclusivity](https://youtu.be/u6zlq0WhlvU) [claim of](https://youtu.be/-HMgaToaEac) [Truth](https://youtu.be/6KYqo4v9kK4). [Be like 🦋](https://youtu.be/crPfz52a32c), [fly with both wings](https://youtu.be/7zY9A28YmFE). People should be able to believe what they want. Insulting one’s religion could be in equivalence to insulting one’s political opinion. Some people pursue religion to seek a purpose in life. Others interpret their religion’s scriptures wrong and it stains the reputation of these religions. Preach Buddhism doesn’t really have a concept of life after death, at least not at its core. I have this exact same mind set, I fucking detest religion it has been the source of most wars, murders, rapes and tortures. It has been the source of corruption and inequality I mean “Divine Right of Kings” anybody?\\n\\nIt’s still a fucking source of those things now! \\n\\nI let people do what they want, because realistically I can’t stop people doing what they want. But it’s sad that some people are utterly brainwashed and pressured by families and communities and it’s awful seeing the way religion dictates how you should live your life. \\n\\nThere is no ultimate goal in this universe, no watchful god to tell us our destiny it’s just ramblings in books. We have no purpose, we have to make our own purpose in life for what little time we have and I think religion greatly hinders that. Another reason reason why I hate it. It\\'s not religion, it\\'s ideas. Communism and other political idealogies are responsible for more deaths than religion. No matter what people believe about the afterlife and the divine, they will always find a reason to kill each other Ugh, rubbish post I fucked Religion before a year and I am happy now George said it best.\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/8r-e2NDSTuE Who hurt you? You know you can not believe in the organization of any religion but still be a moral & ethical person as an individual... right? \\n\\nYou can inspire others to do right on a spiritual level by setting a good example. Leader or show others what you think/believe is the best way to live life and exist. \\n\\nHowever, what business is it of yours if others use their own spirituality or religion to give themselves hope or to have faith... a motivation or purpose for their own existence.  \\n\\nSpirituality & Faith regardless of a specific religion can, in certain individual cases, be a lifestyle someone of their own free will chooses to just get by and live as best they can.  \\n\\nWhy leave any faith and \"come back to the real world\" if someone\\'s faith and spirituality is their own personal motivation for being a good person, and just being good in general. \\n\\nIn my personal point of view maybe you should calm down and think about what you wrote down. We are not all the same and we all can be divided by anything not just religion. Are you going to use someone\\'s religion as a way to scapegoat and discriminate against someone as an individual just because of their religion? \\n\\nLearning and Science is important and crucial to humanity as a whole but so are moral, ethics, and basic human decency... how can this be learned if not by example. Judge someone as an individual by getting to know them & not just making blanket assumptions based on something so superficial as what religion an individual chooses to believe in. \\n\\nMaybe open your own mind and try considering life from another perspective. What if peoples\\' rights to believe & worship as they choose is taken away for absolutely everyone one day... and science and logic are the only options. In World War 2 the Nazis did this. Now, I.S.S.L  is also trying this as well. \\n\\nDo the phrases \"Never Again\" and \"Those who don\\'t learn from the mistakes of history are bound to repeat those same mistakes\" are either ones you\\'ve heard before? This is not helpful. The zeal of atheism adds, in the eyes of the religious, yet another religious perspective...namely that there is no religion. \\n\\nYes, world conflict can be caused by religion. But banishing it all together isn\\'t going to solve anything.\\n\\nIn the secularized West, politics took the place of religion and we can see the effects of that in America. \\n\\nReligion or not, there will always be human conflict. It is the nature of our condition. Might I suggest sir. Why I am an atheist by Bhagat Singh. I\\'m guessing you dont like the pope huh? Religions are cults with a lot of money Nah it\\'s not religion that causes problems, it\\'s people\\'s fucked up agendas and desires that get in the way Man, what did Buddhism do to deserve its spot on your shit list? the problem is people people will always be shitty in an area you find them in Lord Almighty, as I pray today for those that do not know Jesus I ask that You can break whatever it is that has control over their heart that takes them away from knowing You. Psalm 119:67 says, “Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I obey your word.” It is true that many have to fall to their lowest points in life before they turn their life over to You. It often takes painful circumstances to drive us to Christ. Addiction, lust, materialism, and other deadly sins are false gods that are stealing the hearts of those who need You the most. I pray for those who are unsaved that You will be able to rip the bondage of what is holding them back. May they seek You! Amen. As people do we not also have the same right to believe in whatever we want, I am an atheist but I have nothing against religion only what most people believe religion entails... being religious does not mean that you have to go to church or spread your religion it is simply to have faith in something, this something does not have to be a god, it can also be an ideal. You should  be less concerned with believing religion is crap and more concerned with what *you* believe in, what *you* put you’re faith in. There is no need to separate yourself by what or who you are, what makes us who we are is our beliefs. do not separate yourself from everyone else because of this, that is what is wrong with the idea of religion in its current state. That does not mean, however, that believing in something is inconsequential, it could never be more the opposite. Reddit moment To believe in any religion in any capacity you have to actually be stupid. If there’s an afterlife we are in a simulation I believe its misinterpretation of religion/ religious texts, false beliefs and narrow mindset of people that causes unrest, rather than religion. \\nThe broad teachings of most religions uplift the moral values and teach people to live a peaceful life. Fuck you for flipping off my religion! Do you feel better now that you\\'re done having a humiliating temper tantrum? My personal opinion: It is not a religion\\'s fault that there is unrest in many religious countries. It is the fault of the people. They take extreme measures and start making up new rules that serve their goals in the name of the religion. A religion\\'s purpose is to guide people through life and to it easier, but corrupted people have changed that concept. Thus, people will start hating their religion because its idea has been deformed. Nice Reddit moment Wow you’re so enlightened! And edgy too! Preach man You\\'re beating a dead horse here dude. This should be on r/notliketheothergirls Yep yep yep Quit shitting in the streets. AMEN! Agree with the first paragraph, religion is retarded. But it\\'s very possible there is an afterlife. Fuck all of India What drives people to act like this? We understand, you think sky man is bad, but you don’t have to be a complete asshole religion was meant to be proxy for law and order - however a lot of people were too soft in the head to make up their own minds about right and wrong and stuck to the teats of drug-addled story tellers. Then we gave these idiots the right to vote and the invitation to fuck up everything we worked so hard to create-medical aids,education, law and order. I don\\'t think blaming the majority party playing on religious lines is of any use. These hate-filled people are our neighbors,colleagues and acquaintances and currently are ravishing every moment of delhi burning-it warms their heart . If you want to be of any use, remember till the very end who these people are and why they don\\'t deserve an inch of space next to a human. See the contrast. Earth\\'s most intelligent species- Humans creating all sorts of crazy stuff with science.\\nAlso, humans believing their god created everything with some superpowers and that god can punish you and end your problems. Fuck you all, you stupid shits! Believe what you want but don\\'t kill people if they disagree with you and don\\'t brainwash people to join your beliefs. I agree with the reactionary sentiment but religion wasn\\'t another hocus pocus idea coined out of nowhere by a selected group of evil people. Religion and God as a concept grew organically as we evolved, and anything that grows out of human nature and necessity isn\\'t something to be discarded without second thought. Of course any high school student with a functioning brain can tell that most religious concepts are fictional and outright bullshit. But because something is not real doesn\\'t make it invalid and irrelevant. Human nature like that of any animal on earth is filled with hate, violence and raw evil as abundantly as the good side of humanity. We are capable of things far far worse than what we are led to believe in this overly protected and privileged life that we lead. Without any rules for morality or shackling our need to present our shadow to the world, we would have destroyed ourselves long ago. Religion just happened to be the best model we have for working at this. Even as of now we haven\\'t found any sustainable alternatives and most literature, from Jung to modern day psychologists, agrees with this. Yes it sucks that people believe in fairy tales and kill each other to defend their stories, but for now our civilization isn\\'t grown enough to handle no religion on a global scale. As an atheist it makes me extremely sad but that\\'s the way things are. As for the bright side of things, some stuff off top of my head. For now we can try distancing state and religion as much as we can, and elect law makers who support making policies for this cause. We can also try bettering our education system to develop empathy in children as they grow up. May be for starters not elect someone who\\'s entire agenda was divisional politics from the beginning. We can work on initiatives in raising awareness and communal harmony. List goes on. > Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.\\nYou are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.\\nBut, you are here in the now\\n\\nThats probably one of the best descriptions of BUDDHISM I\\'ve ever read :D Has anyone sat back and thought.\\n\"Hey maybe because of the fact I\\'m so incredibly small in this vast infinite universe, maybe just maybe I have no fucking clue of the forces that exist beyond us and the grand scheme of things. People just because your a spec of sand in this universe doesn\\'t mean you don\\'t matter. It just means you can\\'t possibly hope to grasp the gravity of events that are going on at least in this lifetime And with that fuck capitalism and the state too! Bravo. Couldn’t have said it better myself. I cannot fathom how people believe in religion or a god. I really hopes this opens more people eyes. Funny how you sound exactly like a crazy religious zealot but with the opposite message Thank God I’m atheist!! Amen :( Atheism is a Religion. It\\'s ok. It\\'s the time of shadows now. No need to shout it from the rooftops. yikes\\U0001f7e9 I\\'m praying for you, OP. It\\'s said that those with a seared conscious will never fully understand the concept of God the same way others with a strong faith can. The Holy Spirit is within you, OP. You just have to keep searching and the answers will be revealed. But you dont know what happens after death so ur just saying ur rather agressive opinion No gods, no masters. What about sikhi Personally, I\\'ve come to hypothesize that religion was born to quench man\\'s greed to take control over others and their wealth by invoking the fear of the *unknown*. In fact, the concept of a \"God\" itself seems to be a rather genius invention which allowed someone in the very early days to control other people and to set them do their deeds—a few good and *mostly* to crush their opposition. At some point soon after, more people wanted this power over the populace and started their own groups with their own gods and thus, religions were born.\\n\\nIt\\'s my personal belief that one can unlock their true potentials by freeing themselves of the ridicules imposed by their religions and gods and work for the greater good of humanity. But I would also be at peace with people following their beliefs if it didn\\'t lead to abhorrent violence like the one we\\'re witnessing right now.\\n\\nWe don\\'t stand to gain anything by repeating the mistakes of our ancestors and murdering each other. We only stand to gain by working towards the future collectively. Religion is a necessary part of humanity. It is something that brings out the best in some people, and the worst in others, but religion gives people purpose and meaning because it is hard to understand that one day you will just black out of existance. Atheist until the plane crashes Rick Sanchez is tired of your bullshit guys. Pakistani atheist here and WHOLE HEARTEDLY FUCKING AGREE I mostly agree with you. But the tone I am reading is making it sound like a religion lol. \\nFuck religion. But I don\\'t think we should believe on humanity either. We all are stupid and one day we will all die because of our idiocy. Agreed. And we have alcoholics because of jesus/church. (Church made it ok to drink /get drunk). What baffles me is that we still have churches. That people still believe this BS.  How many versions of the bible are there.  How drunk was the guy writing it. The last people on earth to become atheist will be Jews.\\n\\nWhich is why they promote it to everyone else You have quite alot of time to write this popular opinion. Well, that\\'s your belief. Praise jesus Religion was legit just invented by someone who wanted control How is something this close minded so highly upvoted? Yikes I believe that every person can believe what they want, just don\\'t be forcing your views on others. That also goes the other way. don\\'t like religion, no need to announce it, you\\'re opinion isn\\'t an airline flight. Dick. RELIGION POISONS EVERYTHING!!! \\U0001f928 Tbh anybody that thinks they\\'re so certain about what happens after death is just as naive as everyone else claiming they understand this shit. There is literally no proof for either side that there is something or that there is nothing after death, it\\'s all man made speculation. Being a hardcore atheist is no different than being devout to any other faith because you\\'re claiming to know and understand something you very much dont. Until we die, none of us are going to grasp death in a true sense, and any living person that thinks they \"know\" is just as arrogant as the next, regardless of what they claim is out there. Accept that none of us know a fucking thing about death other than the physical process and move on You are almost there... I still choose to follow my religion, but I respect your opinion. To me it\\'s just so empty to live for nothing in the future... to have the present unfulfilling reality and after that, nothing. \\n\\nI fully believe in Christianity... But even for those who don\\'t, isn\\'t there something to be said for having hope in something? Especially for all those people who have nothing to live for? Religion gives us value. \\n\\nIn Christianity specifically, we believe in a God who cares deeply for us and has given us a future after death. Our lives mean something and we have a purpose now, and that carries on after death. To just get rid of that would leave life so empty. \\n\\nSure, we can spend our time making our lives better. Helping others, bettering our lives and the lives of our families. But if that\\'s it, what\\'s the point? \\nIt just seems like a shallow, empty way to live... I\\'m not religious, but I wish I was. I understand why people are religious, it gives purpose to their lives, and I have none. Still some people try to play No True Scotsman, but seriously, that changes absolutely nothing. If it\\'s prone to get violent and has gotten violent multiple times then that also *is*  a potential part of its \"nature\". Better reduce it\\'s radius to just personal preferences. \\n\\nAnd I don\\'t understand why they see you as moral-less degenerate like a dark moist mossy corner untouched by light if they hear you\\'re an atheist. Like, wth is even moral? If you need a book, teachings, blind belief, and a supposed sky daddy just to be nice to others (which you absolutely don\\'t either and rather find a way to justify your wrongdoings) then I can claim myself to be more self dependant than you ever will be. Man should be owned by his own thinking, not enslaved by what he\\'s made entitled to believe. End of story. This nigga really out here believing the only uncreated creation is humans and space dust and nothing came before them. Problem are the \"Hindu atheists\" who are liberal but conflicted and play both sides. They indirectly enable these fascists. \\n\\nAnd Hinduism==Hindutva. Religion did not come first, Politics did. Ganesha was a satanic deity in the purana but his followers gained political power and made him benevolent. Whoever wrote Puranas obviously hated those followers and made their god satanic. It was only the pan-Indian empires who needed secularism(smhartists) who wrote differently but most kingdoms were monotheistic(Shiavist, Vaishnavist etc.), as far apart as Sunni and Shia. Nothing like what it is today.\\n\\nThink about it, who would name their son Duryodhan(originally Suryodan). That\\'s like naming someone Alakshmi. Whichever dynasty Mahabharat is based on obviously demonised them. Victors have been making the \"truth\" forever. Hinduism is not a religion. It\\'s a way of living. I agree on the bit about religion but you couldn’t be more wrong when it comes to the history of mankind and you shouldn’t portray like you do. I just read all that thinking the person typing it was in rage, screaming with a red face. Which he/she probably was lol TLDR \\U0001f971 What an angry little child. I mean... you could just believe and follow a religion and not be a radical... The super atheist Bullshit, I just saw God on Supernatural yesterday.  Likes to be called Chuck. Well said! Brother!!!! very classy reddit Fuck you too lmao. Nobody gives a shit for your nihilism. Also is you think religion is inherently evil you\\'re an idiot PREACH! Belief is good when it\\'s pure. It\\'s bad now because violence apologists use religion as their sword. Religion bad please upvote I see your point but you are one angry person. Relax and let people live. People will come around on their own terms if they so choose. So little words, so many lies It’s funny how ignorant some people are Propaghandi Wow you couldn\\'t be farther from the truth. Christianity has all those answers yet you choose not to consider them because of your lusts (this is not just referring to sexual lusts.) Take some time to actually study Christianity. I know you won\\'t because you don\\'t want there to be a God that can judge you. You want to do what you want thinking that will improve your life. If you only knew and saw the actual movement of God now a days you\\'d be surprised and then afraid of your eternal pathway you\\'ll be on after death. Agzina saglik kardes It’s a scam to get you to waste your very real time on this earth for a promise of more time that doesn’t come. Just enjoy the time you have here and now, it’s finite. AGREE 100% “You do not matter... but matter itself is being part of this universe.”\\n\\nThat’s an oxymoron. You just said it. Under your worldview, we do not matter. In fact, under your worldview you can not tell me why murder is wrong, rape, etc. Because we are cells together to form consciousness. \\n\\nYour worldview is incoherent. Your worldview leads to nihilism and death. Your worldview is the childish one, sounding Incredibly arrogant and edgy. Your worldview is incompatible with reason itself. You cannot even use rationale without borrowing from the religious, because the laws of logic themselves are immaterial.\\n\\nGrow up, learn that the world isn’t black and white and that every human is capable of great evil and is indeed evil, whether religious or atheist. Stop blaming others (religion) for your problems. Man up. Try to do good. And stop following a contradictory worldview that says life has purpose because it has no purpose. Euh atheist movements caused massive exterminations, think Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, wtf this is so stupid. What if I chose to believe in what I want. You chose to believe in or have a lack of belief in what you want. We respect each other’s decision and move on? I think the problem in India is not your religion. It\\'s india Speaking of childish, this rant.  Are you 14 and this is deep?  Religion is the reason we know how to read, how do you know what happens after death?  Have you died?  The catholic church has massive amounts of hospitals and medical care.  So you believe that nothing became something for no reason?  How can you say what is good and evil?  Isnt is all relative if there is no transcendent truth?  Faith in a God of truth and lawfulness is the source of science.  This post seems like the temper tantrum of a small child. I mean, you kind of just explained Buddhism honestly I think religion does have its purposes. It’s gives people hope, teaches good morals, and attempts to scare those people into following those morals. Most of those morals are good, but it also backfires with a lot of hate like you said. Such as Christians and their hatred for lgbt etc. Those words are exactly what I think of humans and religion. each and every word! Oh look another atheist that just has to tell people he’s an atheist. You guys do more spreading your word than all religions combined. Fuckin’ amen!!! Dude chill.... Lol. sorry but low IQ people need some kind of behavioral philosophy to follow or they\\'ll all rage against their existence. I am not particularly religious. I enjoy some of the stories and agree religion causes a lot of damage but it can be helpful to some e.g the lonley. Being part of a community is good. It sounds a bit like you think war etc would end if religion did but I dont think it wouldb there would still be greed etc. You dont really know what happens after death so you can\\'t really expect people to accept your beliefs over thiers. This came out of nowhere Your post indicates that you don’t have a true understanding of Buddhism, and because of that I have to believe that you most likely have a misunderstanding of all religions. To me it seems like your post is one led by emotion rather than of fact. So with all this open mindedness and being insignificant. Why would leaving religion  behind matter? Seems like you put a lot of effort into what is ultimately meaningless.\\n\\nAlso, the 20th century when God was proclaimed dead has been the bloodiest century more so than the past 19 combined. Thanks for that.\\n\\nYou say religion divides. And well I don\\'t disagree with that. The major factors for war have always been greed, power and lust. \\n\\nShalom shalom. God bless. Seems strange to not believe in religion but to be certain that nothing happens after you die.\\n\\nI understand the absolute disbelief of man made religions but it seems just as arrogant to say that you are certain nothing happens after death as it does to say X or Y god is real. Don’t forget Judaism Fuck all atheism\\n\\nAtheism is stupid and fucking useless. This is because I say so. Leave your atheistic beliefs. The Chinese are atheist and kill millions, you are a murderer as well.\\n\\n\\n- sounds pretty fucking retarded when you think with your brain Has this person not heard of communism. That alone has caused just about 100 million deaths in less than 100 years. Thank Stalin and mao for that. Very anti religious people. Before religion there was the \"eye for an eye\" and even before that, if you harmed someone, they were entitled to murder your entire family. Religion shows one way to deal with human urges instead of pouring them into the world. Wa wa cry Jeez, what\\'s worse? A religious figure shoving scriptures down an atheist\\'s throat or an athiest griping at a religious figure about the religion they worship? Why cant people just let others believe/not believe what they want? This post is honestly pretty toxic, I dont know why people cant just do what they want as long as it doesn\\'t harm others Go back to tumblr No doubt religion has been used for violent wars and mass control of the masses but that doesn’t mean religion is inherently evil, only that people have manipulated it for their own selfish ends. TEEHEE at leaST YOU LoVe ThE jEWs. OP said Fuck Islam. Good bye OP. It was nice to read your last post. no On this same topic how about religions that don’t have a defining deity? I have quite a few buddhist friends and Wiccan friends who sure, “believe in fairy tales” according to me and a lot of other people around me, but they are some of the nicest folks I know and none of them pledge to any gods, sure Buddha is a figure head, but I haven’t my found a single person who worships Buddha, only the occasional person who follows the path of the Buddha, and only one of the wiccans I know actually “worships” the moon, the other two just hold a hefty respect for nature. What are some opinions on that line of thought?\\n\\nNot trying to say these religions haven’t caused violence because any belief, hell fuck that, any difference that any human has ever had with another human has caused bloodshed at some point, but I have always found these religions more interesting to talk about then typical “I give my life and soul to god” religions. Full disclosure: I\\'m currently a Christian, but I have serious doubts about my faith. I appreciate the skepticism of your post, but there are some things I disagree with.\\n\\n>You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.\\n\\nSo what? Even if people are only religious because they\\'re scared of death, this wouldn\\'t make religion false. \\n\\n>Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe. What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.\\n\\nWhy do you support \"faith in people\", but not religious faith? Isn\\'t faith the very thing you are trying to eradicate? If you\\'re against believing things without evidence, then both kinds of faith should be wrong. Also, your claim that we control our destiny seems incompatible with materialism(I assume you don\\'t believe in souls), as then we would be subject to physical laws.\\n\\n>Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.\\n\\nI disagree with your second sentence there. Many of the great scientists of the past were religious. George Lemaitre, who developed the Big Bang theory, was a Catholic priest. The monk Gregor Mendel\\'s work on heredity is crucial for our modern understanding of evolution. Those are just two examples. However, I\\'ll be the first to admit that religion and science haven\\'t always been harmonious, but I don\\'t think they\\'re entirely incompatible either. \\n\\nAdditionally, why do you think \"nothing divides us except religion\"? Unless you\\'re defining religion super broadly, I\\'m unconvinced of this. In my experience, politics is just as, if not more, divisive. Also, religion can unite people by giving them a common purpose and meaning.\\n\\nI sincerely don\\'t mean to downplay the religious violence going on in India. It is absolutely terrible and there is no justifying it. However, I would challenge the idea that religion itself is entirely to blame. If religion were to be wiped off the earth tomorrow, I doubt that evil people would go away, and the regimes of Stalin and Pol Pot are evidence of this. The real problem, in my view, is ideological extremism and the gullibility of people to go along with it. These problems can occur whether religion exists or not.\\n\\nOne final point: Throughout your post you say that humans have an obligation to make the world better. My question is: What is the evidence that this obligation exists, and why should anyone follow it? I\\'m not a moral relativist, but I have been struggling lately with justifying my own belief in objective moral values. 👀 Damn who hurt you bro I know no one will read it, but anyway.\\nAuthor, you are super childish and maximalist. I had same ideas about religion when I was 18, but now I actually understand, how stupid I was back then. Yes, blind faith and all the violence, to which some religions and some people, acting religious, lead, is a bad part.\\nBut religion also helps people to cope, for example with a loss of loved ones. Religion helps people to unite together in a community and help each other. Religion is set to promote kindness and prevent violence. Religion helps to achieve an inner peace and solve an existential crisis for some people.\\nReligion (and discussing particular ones) is a hard topic but your outlook on it, as I already said, is absolutely childish and wrong, only looking at one part of it. This is the most reddit post ive seen in months Agree Hey man I’m atheist as well but you really are mad, (I didn’t read through the whole thing so if there is a personal reason sry) OP is a pompous douche bag. >Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion.\\n\\nProve its made up. Im not defending religion, but you do not know either way, or apparently have the ability to critically think. What was the point of this anyways? Looking for validation? Someone piss you off? \\n\\nYou\\'ll get over it. After taking enough fungi and such, religion is trying to describe an essence that it can\\'t be spoken about really, and it isn\\'t a power held above you as Christianity may describe a god as. What it tries to describe is really just the whole picture and each living thing from a microbe to a giant whale is apart of this whole. There is benefit to spiritualism I think, and for each person that path can be different or even non existent. It\\'s just always better, I find, to keep it to yourself and not involve other people. Science has proved that there has to be a creator. You seem to have a lot of hate built up inside you. Stay positive. By saying fuck all religion you are just spreading hate as an atheist. War is inevitable with or without religion. [George Carlin’s take on this](https://youtu.be/8r-e2NDSTuE) This is the best post I have ever read!  Finally a sensible person speaking sensibly. Agreed in every way! Religion ruins us. Can someone explain? Sorry I’m out of the loop a few of your arguments do make sense at a microscopic level..but look\\n\\nlet people do whatever the fuck they want to do\\n\\nhowever if you still insist on digging your nose in these matters, god as a concept rather than a rightful entity could be encouraged instead of going all the way and proposing atheism\\n\\nalso, religion to some is a source of reason/purpose so don\\'t tread on it I would rather choose to believe and in the end be wrong, than live a life believing in nothing and in the end be right.  You are entitled to your opinion, just as anyone else, and I completely support that. But for you to say that what we believe in is \"wrong\" when you have absolutely no proof that there is no higher power, is the same as me saying that you are wrong because there is a higher power. There is no proof either way, that\\'s why they call it faith.  I have friends of all walks of life, hindu, christian, muslim, atheist, and so-forth. None are wrong and none are right. Atheist governments commit mass killings as well. [Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes)  genocide isn’t exclusive to religion, in fact countless people throughout history (and modern day) have been and continue to be killed for simply having a religion. [cheers](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O35Dxb_V2Sc) Maybe if you had some religion you wouldn’t be such an angry bitter person with a potty mouth. Religion is just a tool used by the powerful to stay in power. If it wasn\\'t for religion, it would be immigration, social status, education literally anything.\\n\\nThe problem isn\\'t religion. The problem is the us vs them mentality. Religion is just the means to end. I am always surprised at the Indians inability to work together. Ethnically you are the same. THe english came raped your nation and your people. They left you divided because the wanted to return as your masters. That did not happen, but The west is till your master. You all bleed the same. You are all Indian. Become the power you are meant to be abandon religion and bath in the blood of people like modhi who would promote it. join $DCLT! When you have nothing, religion sounds pretty good. Organized religion is mostly shit.\\n\\nBut that doesn\\'t mean god isnt real. The New Testament is hostile to religion. Yeah, but get rid of the cast system first. Haha OP didn\\'t point Jainism, Sikhism in his post, Jainism and Sikhism are the best religions!! /s Okay but if our existence is indeed pointless, why do scientists then proceed to do all they can to unlock the secrets to the universe and our planet, and to rationalise everything? Simply put, they fear the idea of being a tiny speck in the grand scheme, the same is said for the general public, and of the general public; religious people. Everyone has there own way of coping with insignificance, some people even like to be assholes, and take a lot minutes and even hours out of their miniscule time of existence to do just that, those people are you. If you can\\'t respect other people\\'s decisions and choices, how do you expect your own to be respected in return? Should people even take your opinion seriously if you continue like this? Remember that respecting someone\\'s opinion is different to agreeing with it, if you disagree with their opinion, it doesn\\'t meant you have to disrespect them. Just let people be, instead of creating a negative and depressing energy for everyone around you. After all, your existence is pointless and you can\\'t do anything significant to change how the universe works, so why not just live out that existence in peace and happiness? Honestly I think religion is just a tool, like knife or gun and stuff. It will be just replaced to something else if we somehow erase it completely.\\n\\nI really do understand religion\\'s doing more bad than good nowadays, (our country\\'s Coronavirus infectee\\'s almost tripled thanks to one trashy believer) maybe it\\'s just human nature to have conflict and discriminate. Obviously I do not think both are good, but seeing the world made me think that way. You just started another one! Well, that\\'s just, like, your opinion, man...\\n\\nThe Big Lebowski The Way I see religion is it’s a way to follow life even if it means nothing in the end it’s part of our species at this point and I think it’s just nice to follow somthing in life kinda like a government you specifically address supernatural religions in this rant / well-put point. what about naturalistic religions? Modern Satanism for example  \\\\- Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. \\n\\nI am actually really looking forward to the opportunity to be part of a supernova. Seriously though look at the Catholic church and the Vatican i keep reading reports about these sick fucks molesting children and they think once they die THEY are going to heaven? HAHAHA The pope is such a farce get fucked you sick child molesting ass clowns.\\n#FUCKALLRELIGION I mean I don’t believe in any religion either, but the people who do aren’t hurting anybody by believing in something more, and it makes them feel better. Atheism is a religion just like other religions. Religion poisons everything You sure do have a strong distaste for something you don\\'t believe in. Interesting. Tell me more about how or what I should believe. Thanks. I discovered this when I was 8. Fuck you too :). If heaven exists, a Muslim might go to heaven. A Christian might go to heaven. A jew might go to heaven. But a Atheist is forever in the grave r/atheism is leaking This sounds like the “talk” every religion has right before trying out that mass murder thing you speak of. Maybe human nature is more to blame join a group>become fanatical>fuck shit up. It’s the rinse and repeat of mankind acting super special cause you have the answer. Not wanting to start anything just know that one search and word replace and you become the people you’re bitching about. The biggest problem with religion has always been the people. They try to twist the words to fit their world view and when they need to do that it is never about their god anymore. Let us blame everything on religion, and absolutely not on humans lust, greed, wrath, envy, pride, gluttony and avarice. Sure it is easy for you to hate on religion when you feel abandoned by the entity that we call god. \\n\\nDo you really believe that we advanced in technology because we \"worked together\" or is it who can dominate who first? \\n\\nHumans are a spectrum that goes from evil to good and people are spread out in that spectrum, and very few people are really fking pure and are good but alot of people are fking evil. We manipulate, we decieve, we conspire and we kill for our gain. Religion is a trend that nations use to motivate if there was no religion there would be something else to motivate people to kill and rape. Don\\'t put it on religion because you are so fking arrogant and ignorant to your leaders and humanity.  \\n\\nYou say religion is a fairy tail but what you are talking about is the biggest fairytail there is, people working together, holding hands and dancing to we are the world. Sit your fking ass down you clown. Let me ask you this how the fk do you know that there is nothing after death, the very argument you use to \"put religius people in place\" is a two edged sword, how the fk do you know that there is nothing after death? \\n\\nLet people believe what they want to believe, jesus we have people that thing there are billions of genders, and media is fking supporting them and condemming religion. You are a puppet my friend we all are so stop acting like you know whos behind the scene nobody knows in the end we all will die and by then will figure out whos right and whos wrong, id rather be religius and die if there is something after death il be doing fine and if there is nothing il be fine too, but guess if there is something after death and it is one of those religius beliefs that is \"right\" and you are an athiest who shittalked people for being religius guess where you are going my friend... hell or being reincarneted as you again you cunt. Christians in America especially. I love to read about ancient history and one thing I\\'ve learned is that most Christians don\\'t have a clue how the bible was written or how it was rewritten. I highly suggest Misquoting Jesus if anyone wants a deep dive. Most Christians just blindly follow and believe whatever they are told, and that imo is a cult lead by false prophets. Christians are such ignorant children. I agree.\\nBut i think when christianity first got invented it might have had some actually good things to say.\\nThe sad thing is emperors used religion to control people rewriting the bible while doing so.\\nAnd now it\\'s full of random stuff that is only there because it was useful to some person in a high position. Chill bhai What you are all referring to is organised religion. Organised religion is a huge cause of death and unrestbut normal religion is fine. Chill. Not to seem like that guy, but our sun will not go supernova, rather it will expand as a red giant and then shrink to a white dwarf where it will remain dominant with the earth added to it. Also you cant just rudely tell people to abandon religion and expect them to listen.\\n\\nEdit- I am a retard and cannot spell Yea same Religion can be a source of evil, but most of the values they teach give guidence and hope to people to live good lives, I believe that many people have realized religion is bullshit and any creation story for fables are made up. But the message they teach can help those in their darkest hour\\n\\nYou never hear about people leading good lives from religion but only the horrors of greed and power hungry corrupt members. To smear the brush wide you forget the benefits that these organizations create too. So personally, fucking them all isn\\'t a fair assessment of the situation to be honest Religion is opium for the masses. I can joke about Jesus without fear of being killed. Lol at people arguing over which country is the least worst. If anyone here thinks religion is worthless or that we are better off without it, you haven’t engaged with religion on a serious, academic level, which means you don’t understand a crucial aspect of humanity. You don’t understand human culture. Every religion offers vital insights into the collective unconscious of human cultures. Highly recommend reading Nietzsche’s “Thus Spoke Zarathustra” or honestly any work by Carl Jung. Wanting to get rid of religion is like throwing the baby out with the bath water. How many wars do not have their roots in religion?  A retired general once told me he had studied it during his time in the forces and he couldn\\'t find any.  Is this true? Damn son, who hurt you? Big mood [deleted] A fitting song\\n\\n[Propagandhi - Haille Sellasse, Up Your Ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPpXY1aWKgI) I think it was Jaggi Vasudev who said something along the line of “to believe in god is ignorance, to not believe in god is ignorance “ in relation to observation perception and fundamental human growth. Basically stay in our own lane but don’t act haughty. While what they believe in may be fiction, they still believe in it. Even if you want to believe otherwise, religion has a very prominent impact on our society, and we have to understand and accept that. To say “fuck Religion” on Reddit isn’t exactly a means to an end. \"I think it\\'s a waste of time\" cool, and you\\'re allowed to, just like I\\'m allowed to be a christian. Stop going out of your way to shit on things that bring people peace just because you\\'re bitter and unhappy Would be cool if people cited their rants more often. The Middle East is living proof that Religion is cancer. Especially when it takes control of the government. Go owfff Wow this started a whole war in the comments 😂 Probably not* the best way to start that claim. Preach it brother! Not takings sides here but let’s call any religion what it truly is ... an organized belief system.  Since we live in a world where things create other things, there must be something (aka God, Buddha, Allah etc?) to help explain the creation of man in order to convince, control, and organize the vulnerable believers. More people have been killed on this earth over religion than any other means ... we need to stop the madness!!!! I haven’t read all this. But about 2 years ago I felt exactly the same way. I absolutely DESPISED religion with a burning passion as well as 99% of the people who believe in it.\\n\\nI’m not a practicing religious person by any means, but I know now there is more out there, outside of what we can touch. I had a spiritual awakening similar to when people take DMT but I didn’t take any drugs and it lasted about 6 months before I realised what was going on. Thought I was going insane at first. Either way, calm down lol. You’re showing your age. We ourselves are more to blame rather than \"religion\".\\nFuck all of us! The reason that I am not an atheist, is because it is entirely unhelpful. I gain nothing from it whereas from christianity I gain happiness and companionship. \\nAnother way I have always looked at it is:\\n\\nAtheism:\\n                Best case scenario: nothing |\\n                Worst case scenario: hell\\n\\nReligion:\\n               best case scenario: heaven |\\n               Worst case scenario: nothing\\n\\nEdit: formatting Let me change \"Fuck all Religion\" to \"Fuck all conservative religion\". If your religion makes you close your mind then yes fuck your religion. Fuck India and all the awful assholes that answer phones for American companies there... I know the negative impact of the religious sentiments but its not all bad, it does give a answer to questions like why is it wrong to commit suicide or murder. While undoubtedly everyone should form their own belief system instead of believing in anyone but i think we are quite far away from there, cause if you reject religion that can descend into nihilism and that is not exactly a good belief system if your life is going downhill, that is basically like flirting with suicide, so i the bleakest of moment religion can be a ray of light and its all empowering when it concern only the individual but lets be honest here religion always end up becoming institutionalized. My reply: (deep breath) I know it\\'s funny to be an edgy 13 year old that trashed on religion and then point out others are meaningless since you know you\\'re life is meaningless but here\\'s a fact. The biggest removal of religion in the USSR killed hundreds of times more than religion did in history. Ugh fuck off shit dude, let people live their lives. i’m not even religious but chill 🤣 Penis. South park is !y religion Here’s the big problem with what you are saying. We all don’t know for sure if God or gods are real. But a lot of people choose to believe because there sad and depressed and need love. So think about what your gonna say before you say it. Also scientists still have not found concrete proof that we evolved from something in the water. And there is the fact they can’t replicate fossilization. Look it up!!! I believe in God, not religion. Genuinely asking but why do a lot of you hate religion? Saying that their is no greater Being or after life eventually leads to nihilism. If we\\'re just a speck in space and in the end I get nothing and the world just implodes, why not kill myself and everyone else off? Why even live? It doesn\\'t matter in the end does it?\\n\\nI\\'m not a religious fanatic myself, but their is value in religion and it\\'s teachings. Morals eventually derive from some form of religion. Just because there was bad done by people claiming to be religious, doesn\\'t mean all religion is bad does it?\\n\\nScience has created the atomic bomb. Science has led to guns and mustard gas. But not all science is bad is it? Science has made medical advancements and has  increased life expectancy.\\n\\nReligion has given a lot of people a sense of direction and morality. I gurantee there are more Christian\\'s helping those starving in Africa than atheists. Gurantee it.\\n\\nI hope all of you understand where I\\'m coming from and I understand where a lot of you are coming from. There have been a lot of religious assholes. But it has also help guide us in terms of science and morality. It\\'s not all bad. You can choose what to believe but don\\'t shit on all religion because it had some bad eggs. \\n\\nBest to all of you! \\n\\nThe problem doesn\\'t lie in religion itself but the institutionalization happed after they were formed. I am a Hindu and I like to read different school of thoughts in  sanatan dharma. The main problem of today\\'s religion and their followers is they have very institutionalized thought processes. India is the land of seekers. We have embraced atheism long before it was \"Cool\". You can look for Charvaka school of philosophy which is basically seeking truth in the form of materialism and atheism. I partly agree that religion is root cause of major problems in world today but that is not because of religion it self but what humans did with it. We pitted each religion against each other to justify our war mongering nature. If you closely observe historical timeline you\\'ll observe that majority of wars that were fought on basis of religion, were in times when there were very few advances in philosophies of each religion. Religion is meant to serve personal values but unfortunately we humans have used it to justify our actions. \\n\\nFor the fellow atheists here, I respect your choice of atheism. But we are the part devil of this world as well. And lastly why don\\'t we blame Science for creation of nuclear weapons which can annihilate world in matter of minutes? We can\\'t, cause we know that it\\'s devil that we created ourselves out of nuclear science just like we did with religion and created intolerance, terrorism etc. Science and religion are two very powerful philosophies but their right use depends on us. Lmao ok boomer There\\'s a difference. I do have some faith that there is a God, I just don\\'t believe in religion. Religion is run like a business... For someone who hates religion you sure do talk about it a lot ha ha. Honestly you just sound angry, and hurt. HOLLA! yea religion is not the reason people kill and hate eachother. Its a human nature. Lots of animals kill eachother as well,even their own species and they are not religious as far as I know Boedhism ain\\'t a religion per se. This post is wildly hateful. Tread carefully India. I say we just exterminate the human race. Please donate to my cause You left out Judaism.  Slicing baby\\'s dicks apart is the ultimate violation of human rights. To say something came from nothing is insanity. Are you insane? The desperation in trying to push your own beliefs on others suggest you are. Bro just live your life. When you die you will know for sure what is on the other side. Leave me out of it. I will can contest you on your claim that we evolved. Okay doomer The tipping is strong with this one. Religion is like a teddy bear. It was useful for our species in our infancy, when our ignorance needed some psychological crutch to calm us down in this scary universe. However, as we are about to enter our adult phase, it\\'s past time we leave our psychological-comfort teddy bears behind. I think Indian societal norms are from that of the Stone Age. There’s hundreds of sexual assault cases there that don’t even get heard. Child abuse does not even faze the Indian public nor apparently does child trafficking nor child marriages. You try to make a fair argument, but the basic idea of religion is the shared belief on being moral.\\n\\nIt may sound like stating the obvious but there is a difference with being moral and in believing it.\\n\\nTo some it may be a small difference to others not.\\n\\n(For example filtering the world in our conscience to have a good inner voice. What ever we think, we try to think in a certain positive way. \\n\\nRather than not necessarily believing, and just see how we feel about the situation. How we process the world is Thus different. The filter is of our own making and random.\\n\\nAnd it might affect a person in the sense they feel less empathy or care less especially when no one is watching.\\n\\nThey might forget to process things in a certain way, and their language might also change and their emotions as a result as well.)\\n\\nBut also to make things more obscure we are dealing with a world that is religious, so how can you say that people not believing in being good is going to make them better especially when no one is watching?\\n\\nWe are also dealing with a lot of benefits and welfare, what will happen to the morality of people in a moment of crisis if they don’t have the custom of believing in being good?\\n\\nI can understand The want to make the world a better place, but freedom of religion is the best to hope for. Trying to change the dynamics too much is another uncertainty.\\n\\nFor example can you guarantee security and wealth so people are not dealing with circumstances that may be ‘believing’ morality will have more benefits than not (presumably).\\n\\nI think if people want to make the world a better place it comes from those things in improving people’s lives. That is with technology. And I think we don’t quite have that level of technology to quite easily say that abandoning a belief system will be better. Since even being just moral, implies some kind of belief in a constitution to make it work in tough times, when no one is watching. For example almost every country is dealing with a significant amount of corruption, will them having less faith, or not having to pretend to be ‘faithful’ have more positive effects on corruption or not?\\n\\nOna global scale religion is different than before. The conversation regarding religion in public generally involves people being and ‘acting’ good. At least they have to ‘act’ good which is still important imo. There is a net benefit not just how it translate to a certain culture of caring, or good action but also the psychological impact it can have to be an inclusive society rather than one that is more capitalistic and is a dog eat dogs world.\\n\\nI think by rejecting the belief in being good, rather than just common sense or common interests Of being good, can quickly shift human behavior to be more unhealthy. We can also look at humans being savage without laws and instructions. Their natural state is quite barbaric, which is why the point of technology and being a utopia is important. The barbaric humans of the past did not have a belief system and even if they did, their lives were too extreme to have a use for it. It took humans a long time to reach this level of society and religion was their crutch for good or bad. Which is why it is a big uncertainty due to their basic nature and their dependence on religion, to say wether they would be good without religion.\\n\\nJust like philosophers of the past have studied human behavior and some will say humans need to be taught to be good to be good. \"Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSame statement as believing in God, the fuck you know about post-death, how the fuck you can prove it. Religion isn’t meant to be a collection of stories, but an easier interpretation of complex morals and values.  Hinduism, specifically, is not a religion as Western Philosophy has deemed, but more so a lifestyle, a way of living.  It truly is a beautiful conception of our reality, in which each god is a symbol for humanly needs (Lakshmi for wealth, Hanuman for strength, Ganesha for perseverance, etc). And in turn, we use prayer to each God as a way to ease the mind and focus on one entity.  Hinduism says that we are all one, and oneness is derived from ultimately dissolving the ego.\\n\\nReligion isn’t supposed to be a collection of fiction and stories, but a teaching of what life is.  It is a collection of teachings from many different individuals, who place these teachings in the format of stories so it is easier to understand. Disbelief in a god is also a belief itself. You cannot claim to know the universal truth when it is not possible. Thank the universe someone finally said it! Its not religion its confessions that harms humanity. You can try to think of an religion that simply believes in the power of love and set love above all other things. \\nIt would not harm humanity. By definition it cant harm humanity.\\nYou get the point?\\nI think there was a guy called jesus. Might be he had an similar idea...\\nPoint is the biggest utopies (e.g. Religions, communism) will always be most likely abused by people not believing in anything and harm humanity. Only a sith deals in absolutes Why you so mad ? 😟 Didn\\'t know I was on r/cringe Op probably wouldn’t be so angry about what other people think if he found peace in religion, just saying. Lol eat a dick Religion is a crutch that was once required and helped greatly in the structure of societies, the problem is, like with anything, when it came time to move on from it, the people involved were earning too much money and garnered more respect and power than they ever could have on their own so they abused their power to stifle progress that would have made them obsolete.\\n\\n The problem now is indoctrination through repetition, and, although I understand your anger, arguments are seldom won by the person telling everyone else how stupid they are, especially when we (humanity/science) have only answered some of lifes questions and their religion offers all the answers, albeit wrong ones. Woah guys we have an edgy atheist here ok cool Religion is not a problem, people having different beliefs and values than you is not a problem. You are so blind to your hatred of people who believes differently than you to see your attitude is the problem. Your attitude is shared by people of religion about other religions, non-believers, and people who scare them because their different. Everyone wants to fit every body into their own box, instead of accepting the fact that people are going to believe how they choose to believe. I am a proud Christian and I love people, I have views that differ from the rest of the world I know that. I will never force my beliefs or views on others, but I expect the same respect from others. You have the right to feel the way you do, that’s ok, but to belittle people and a destructive and aggressive way is not the best way to address our differences. Learn to have respect for your fellow humans that believe differently than you, don’t box yourself in to a small area. Just my opinion take it for what you will /r/copypasta Religion isn\\'t the problem it\\'s the idiots that don\\'t know how to follow religious values/rules. Yeah I’ll never get over how call culty organized religion is I will continue to be religious and not become a miserable prick like yourself. Enjoy your pessimistic lifestyle and tell me again about how my life beliefs make me as miserable and incorrigible as yourself! Believe what you want to believe but if it makes you this down on life I would think into other options my friend. Lol you clown Well said. Shut the fuck up. You don\\'t know anything for a fact, just the same as a theist. Nobody knows what happens after death, nobody knows whether there\\'s a God. Plenty of things divide us, not just religion. r/enlightenedcentrism This is so beautiful omg. \\nThanks for proving words can be breathtaking Wow so woke cause religion bad Yep all religion. Fuck your cross and for head burka shits. Amen. Fuck any God! Nah I\\'m good bruh r/EdgyAthiest Fuch ewe. have you died ? how do you know theres nothing after? energy never dies? oh waits its just YOUR belives. > You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter.  \\n\\nThis is a subjective claim, but I would argue that this is very wrong. As far as we know there is no other life in this universe except on Earth. Also, as far as we know there is no other form of life in the universe as intelligent as a human. The Earth may be a (giant to us) tiny speck floating in the vast expanse, but that expanse is speckled  with unliving and unintelligent stuff. As far as significance, the human race may be the most amazing product of the universe so far. Yarr this dude is going to HELL¡! Well that’s just like, your pinion man. Yes yes and fucking yes. Religion is the worst of all evils I\\'ll  never understand why someone is so angry with something they dont have to be a part of  idgaf if you dont believe in what I believe in. That\\'s your decision and I\\'m happy you have the right to believe what you want to believe.\\nEdit: typo This is bs.\\n\\n1- He  stated facts that are not facts at all, like we coming from Africa 300k years ago, we dont know for sure.\\n\\n2- He is against religion but then speak about we are nothing on the big schemes of things? This is actually paraphrasing many religions out there.\\n\\n3- No one gives a shit about religion, wars are not made on religion, the people who creates wars, they just put a catchy name to it to force people to move but they themselves dont give two fucks about a war because of religion or resources.\\n\\n3.1- Atheist also make as many wars as they please\\n\\n4-Atheism is just another bs as well as religion you people are the opposite faces of the same coin. Everything u talk as well as deeply religious guys is pure trash. Dont you fucking think u are outside the bubble of human beings and think you are being objective, like that would be actually laughable.\\n\\n5- Religious people as well as agnostics or atheists follow the same bs, thinking the have the reason and that they know it all. Lmao you guys give me a break. There is religion yes, but there is also a connection to the Universe that we all have. A connection that doesn’t require you to be religious. Religion has set us back so far it’s hilarious. I thought 18 was the minimum age for reddit No thanks As I was reading this post, I could only think of the Quote from \"Pale Blue Dot\" by Carl Sagan \\n\\n\"  hat\\'s home. That\\'s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \"superstar,\" every \"supreme leader,\" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.\\n\\nThe Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.\\n\\nOur posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.\\n\\nThe Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.\\n\\nIt has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we\\'ve ever known.   \"\\n\\nWe are nothing but mote of dust suspended in a sun beam. And here we are fighting in the name of the unknown. You can have your religions AND be loyal to your species. Don\\'t worry about religion if you don\\'t want a part in it. Every person is an individual autonomous person, so why are you going to spend so much time being against their decisions? Just enjoy your own way, and if these are your complaints, then be, in your character, the way  you want to see others in your world act. Just because some people are, of my personal opinion, stupid and warlike, doesn\\'t really mean that Religion is the primary cause. Sure, religion is easy to blame, because people like to use it as a way to justify their aggression and transgressions by \"Invoking the law of the lord\" or some other mindless and willful reason.\\n\\nPeople are afraid to change their ways of life, and religious discrimination has been the main cause of unrest in India, usually not religion in and of itself. Religion is a positive thing, you can\\'t just stop something from existing because you hate it. How about nurturing it into something that can actually be positive and helpful to the world?\\n\\nAvoiding conflict is often as simple as moving forward. When you put down your weapons and abandon your conflicts, progress happens. Happy lives can happen. Simple as that.\\n\\nEDIT: After sifting through some comments, I think what OP may be expressing is the lack of an outlet for those who are not interested in religion whatsoever. And that\\'s fine. I think that non-religious culture greatly benefits the interests of everyone. Just a matter of waiting for people to wake the fuck up. Amen brother. A-fukken-men. Interesting Post detailing you opinion. I don\\'t want to start an debate because God knows its been done before by men/women more better versed than myself. \\n\\nAs a scientist, I am left with evidence that points to the existence of an all powerful all knowing God. \\n\\nMatter and Energy Exists: Where did it come from? Another universe? Maybe but where did that come from? Our universe requires causality but what caused the first cause? Perhaps something without a cause, without beginning nor end. \\n\\nMatter and Energy Behaves in a constant manner: We know there are attractive and repulsive forces which dictate bonding and energy levels but we have no idea why this is the case. Its like a universal \"settings\" tab running the background keeping the laws that govern this universe constant. \\n\\nAlso, saying F\\\\*ck all religious doesn\\'t make you sound too smart. cheers, ill drink to that Ummmmm ya Amen. Talk about tolerance of other beliefs eh?\\nOne of the main reasons India will never thrive because it\\'s people don\\'t have tolerance so you can Hindus in charge the country will be a shithole, you can have Atheists in charge the country in charge but until you develop tolerance for other beliefs you will be stuck in the stone age. Actually religion has brought peace to me. Fuck modi and his cronies. He’s a top class chutiya. He’s the hitler of the brownies. Let’s be honest. That’s what this post should have been about. For thousands of year people have co-existed and also they had their fair share of wars. So much hatred is out there😓 I can\\'t believe it still exists in 2020. Glad the trends say it\\'s going away Fuck people who try to push their beliefs onto others. That includes you. Yikes. I disagree. Wait, not Jainism. Right? Sir this is a mcdonalds Fuck you Fuck you! Imagine if people got into wars over whether or not Santa was real. As an Indian, I approve of this sentiment. I will gladly vote for a politician who runs on a policy of abolishing religion from our country and from the face of this world. Any plans of running? i was born in a muslim family, same here, i think religions are nothing but some kind of culture. Let the enlightenment spread.  It is time. We are alone on a rock floating through space, we have invented everything on this planet and “gods” are for people who cannot hang with the idea of the endlessness of the universe.  It’s time to move on to space. PRAISE r/cornbible I do not belive in God or ANY religion.\\n\\nBUT\\n\\nYou have to be an even bigger moron than the biggest religious zealot to say, WITHOUT A DOUBT, that there is nothing after death. Simply saying to yourself that there 100% cannot be anything makes you look like an idiot. Can you time travel? Can you travel to the beginning of time? No? Then stop acting like you can. Nobody knows. There is probably nothing but nobody knows except people that have died. Fanatism and lack of education go hand-in-hand. Every time I hear about religion riots in India, inevitably follows another report with lives lost. Reminds me of the \"holy wars\" of medieval Europe. Amen! y’all are so pathetic it’s sad i actually believe in a dimension where all dead people go, but i aint believing in a zombie On an unrelated note, I felt like playing DOOM 2016 after reading this. I don\\'t think Buddhism counts here, especially Zen. While I don\\'t agree with religion in alot of context especially when used hypocritically or to cause harm , there is alot of truth in myth , in archetypes , consciousness and practices especially in buddhism. Take rebirth for example, from a scientific standpoint if the universe created life why cant it decompose it then create a new stucture from it. Your Belief isn\\'t going to replace certain truths and reality especially in things like consciousness. However in terms of childish belief people are more unreasonable and unreliable than any religious teachings lol. See your statement of you do not matter but matter exist is contradictory in nature, & even things like immortality isn\\'t such a far-fetched concept as technology progresses so are we suppose to abandon science when that becomes religion and then passes into myth. I remember my fifteenth birthday too, good times. >Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism.  \\n>  \\n>Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.  \\n>  \\n>You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.\\n\\nYou just described Buddhism. Amén! Ok Better to be a non-organized spiritualist then be a member of any kinda specific religion. Your points are highly valid tho. Can\\'t saying this kind of thing get you in trouble in your country? Ironically, in trying to stop divisions your anger and hostility may create them, people are more receptive to calm and well-argued people. \\n\\nI\\'m religious, the only thing i oppose in your argument is that religion is made up. That is it. Yes we die. Yes there may not be anything beyond this. Yes violence is bad. Yes religion is very divisive. Yes your legacy should be based on being good to mankind. \\n\\nYou\\'re angry, that\\'s fine. But in the end people will always believe in religion, your anger only seeks to do the thing you don\\'t want, make divisions. Calm down. What do you say to the people who\\'s religion helped them become a better person? But you go to the moon before clean water and sanitation. Have fun shitting in rivers... the Roman’s had fucking sewers but India says fuck it let’s go to the moon. Because our brains create problems, I can see how religion seems like a problem. But, on the other hand, because our brains will religify just about anything, I can see how not having any at all would make them all that more difficult to trace, and therefore dangerous to battle. We all tend towards the worship and zealotry of something, the religious are just surprisingly less delusional on this point than the non-religious. All cultures have had three things in common since time immemorial \\n\\nArt\\n\\nMusic\\n\\nReligion \\n\\nReligion is hardwired into us for some reason. Plus there are so many mysteries in this world that really can’t be explained. Look up reincarnated children on YouTube. Not that reincarnation has anything to do with religion. Religions have adopted reincarnation as a perk, however. I feel the same way about reality shows like Nach Baliye and Dance Plus. Fuck all ya\\'ll for watching crap TV and encouraging them to make more, you\\'re just filling your minds with pointless crap.\\n\\nBoredom is good for your mental health. Saying that there is no experience after death is just as flawed as saying that there is experience after death. It is true they religion has caused many problems in the world, but you don’t know any better than anyone else does. By acting like you do, you are just as toxic as a close minded religious person. It’s funny someone can believe so wholeheartedly something so specific happened 300,000 years ago but completely dismiss something else. What u believe doesn\\'t matter 👹👹😾😾 I hate that people are allowed to be taught religion by their parents. Especially Islam. Islam is designed only for the purpose of oppressing women, but even the women don\\'t realize it because they\\'re taught that it\\'s okay essentially from birth. Lol you sound young. *grabs popcorn* If anyone commits violence in the name of religion, it\\'s settled; they\\'re a massive Mcfucknugget. Yo who didn\\'t fuck their mans right Amen. \"Open your mind\" 😂. And yet they\\'re telling people what to believe. [deleted] Atheistic Anarchism will be the real salvation of humanity. Whot is this india The main cause of strife in the world is jackasses trying to tell everybody else what to do.\\n\\n  \\n\\nSit down, shut up and chill TFO. So much hate in this post. :( Darwin Award tl:dr Fuck freedom of choice, fuck culture, fuck age, fuck gender, fuck me hating cheese, fuck you hating me hating cheese, fuck ducks, fuck kids, fuck moms, fuck language,  duck you, fuck me, fuck everybody\\n\\nWelcome to the divided world\\nBy design\\nNot my design\\n\\nIt reminds me of the second renassaince, animatrix \"....and for a time, it was good...\" Just putting it out here that atheists are just as idiotic/smart as the people who believe in religion. If you want to \"Fuck\" religion, try being agnostic. You go nowhere with a closed ideology of atheism. WORD My faith makes me happy, i don\\'t push it onto anyone, i just practise it myself. I don\\'t see why i should leave that, your post is grossly generalizing.\\n\\nIt also brings me and my local community togther, which is nice for the many who aren\\'t equipped with stable social lives. Jesus loves you Woah there This is some real Cosmicism thinking. 10s of thousands of years of theology? Obliterated, reduced to mere atoms. Christards? Owned 😎 It really just depends on what we really believe in. If you believe in God then just believe. Then there are others that might be making up beliefs then calling it \"religion.\"\\n\\nGod may be true to some but Religions are definitely man-made beliefs. Coming from r/all. If it’s forced or violent like it is in India of course. But you need to be able to believe what you believe in. some people just need it for hope. So fuck the religion that is inciting violence in India. I think we all secretly know this, but it\\'s a nice distraction to believe in it instead of just believing that we\\'re all gonna just die and become nothing. At least that\\'s why I believe in religion. Religion isn’t evil, people are.\\n\\nSorry to burst your bubble love, but you seem a lot more childish with your little temper tantrum then any random religious person just minding their own business. \\n\\nI understand where you’re coming from, to atheists people of faith may easily appear as delusional fools who pray to a god to make themselves feel better about their existence...but who are we to take that from them? Who are we to snatch away their hope so cruelly? If it makes them happy, and indeed, encourages them to live a more moral lifestyle for fear of god’s wrath or the afterlife, then what is the harm? \\n\\nYou accuse them of being foolish to believe in man made stories, but science is the same in that regard...in my eyes, the latter has far more credibility, but it is still just another concept manning has come up with in a desperate attempt to explain the word around us. \\n\\nIt is, with all due respect, simply idiotic to say religion is the only thing that divides us...mankind is capable of deep kindness and empathy, but we are also capable of mindless hatred and violence. It is not religion to blame, but us. We allow any and all differences to divide us, be they religion, economic status, race, nationally, gender, sexual identity, or even age...it is foolish to try and blame religion for the endless bloodshed we cause. \\nIndeed, it could easily be argued that, using your vehement rant as an example, it is also the very lack of religion that divides people.\\n\\nI am not claiming religion is a force for good, but it is not a force for evil either. Merely a tool, used and twisted by humans for their own purposes. Some use it for good, spreading love and support, others use it to pit people against each other. Attack the people misusing it, not the religion itself. Do not give those people the excuse of blaming their religion. Their actions are their own.\\n\\nBeing an atheist does not mean you have to hate religion, or people who follow one. We pride ourselves on our oh so great logic, and then go around mindlessly mocking and hating people of faith, for what? Because it provides an easy scapegoat for us to take our frustrations with the world out on? If it helps them live a happier life, so be it! \\n\\nLive and let live!\\n\\nSorry for the long and drawn out response everyone, but I cannot understand why atheists insist on such a harsh attitude towards religion. \\n\\nJust because someone of some religion may have hurt you, doesn’t make religion inherently bad. Indeed, there are elements of religions that anyone could benefit from, e.g. meditiation\\n\\nI’d highly recommend Alain de Botton’s ‘Religion for Atheists’ to anyone who’s interested :) Damn dude, you sound so certain. I’ll pray for you. lol Happy birthday! Seems unfair to lump in Buddhism with the others, it’s really more of a philosophy or way of thinking than a true religion. Soooo edgy. Regardless of how you feel about religion, its hard to deny that having a belief system and being forced to believe you have accountability for your actions in this life is not a bad thing for most people. This rant sounds reads like an adolescent emotional outburst. Chances are something in your past with religion has you stuck in an angry place. There certainly is value in discussing the worth of religion in general or just one in particular, but this is off the mark. Come back at it after you figure out what\\'s really hurting you so bad. I mean we really don\\'t know though, let people live. Those who try to force you to live or act some certain way can surely get fucked. I am not religious at all, but you talk about death like you died and came back to tell us what happened. You don\\'t know that there is no rebirth or what happens after death. Get off your non-religious pedestal. You could make a religon out of this! Is it that time of the month? Many prayers needed here for many lost souls! I pray you learn and accept the truth before it’s too late! God sent us his only Son to be sacrificed so we can enter the kingdom of heaven. He died to save us as we are all sinners. Yes I am a Christian but I don’t believe in any specific religion. All you\\'re doing with this post is isolating every religious person from your cause and contributing to the stereotype that atheists are unreasonable Tldr... but i agree. That\\'s one opinion Whoever you are i love u! “The only that happens is you blackout and stop existing” \\n\\nPlease prove that.\\n\\nY’all atheists have so much fucking hate You preaching the fact there is no god is the same as someone shoving religion down your fucking throat. You are as much of a cunt as the Pope. You\\'re also a pussy if you\\'re wondering. Ive recently been coming to terms with how ridiculous I think it is that everyone blames god for their success.  God didn\\'t create modern technology, or scientific breakthroughs, or medical breakthroughs..\\n\\nWe did.  Human beings did all of it.  Everyone says how amazing God is, but they\\'re all wrong.  Its not God who is amazing.  It is us that is amazing. bruh chill the fuck out, check out nihilism btw. Preach brother! Who is God to a non believer. I don’t like any religion. I’d rather have a simple life without thinking who i’m offending by not doing things by their bullshit superstitious sense.\\nI don’t know if religion is the problem or not. But i will say this: people have forgotten the faith that comes with the religion. They forgot that the biggest thing they need to do while worshipping their god is believing in him no matter what others say. If you get offended when someone questions or makes fun of your religion, then i’m sorry to say, its not having faith, its just being a fan of something and defending it just for selfish reasons (to prove that you can never be or choose something wrong). There’s no reason to be physical or offensive by other’s remarks, because what religion is only an agnostic’s benefit of doubt. Not sure I\\'d class Buddhism a religion. It can be if you want to believe all the made up magical shit. But it\\'s more of a self help guide. someone needs to get laid The only part I disagree with is what happens when you die.. no fade to nothingness. Instead we’ll all be trippin our balls off on DMT. You’ve lost. You can make a religion out of this. You need Jesus You are going to be very surprised when you die.  I would not take the chance.  Besides, we all have to believe in something.\\n\\n\\nIts OK..I k ow you are made, but. Don\\'t be made at religion..that\\'s just crazy.\\n\\nSo, what is really the PROBLEM? oof To “blackout” is difficult to grasp if there is nothing further. If mind does not go further it cannot know “blackout”. Well written piece. I do have some questions. \\n\\n\\nLeave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. \\n- Does this involve not caring about other species? Because religion does involve loyalty, to a point it’s blind. \\n\\n\\nWe are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. \\n-yeah, no on that. If you have a darker skin colour it doesn’t matter to some, who or what you believe in. Also, let’s learn from a war that is now known as the Second World War. Any suggestions how to go about these differences? \\n\\nAs we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. \\n- Not always: ask anti-vaccine people among others\\n\\n\\nReligion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.\\n- I don’t agree with this statement, but holy cow, does history and recent events make it hard to disprove. Nothing divides us except religion? LOOL talk about someone not living in the real world. Now your are starting to get it.. God would not want to restrict his children but let them have their own free will. Name one religion where they preach free will over what they tell you are their standards.. Sir, this is a Wendy\\'s. Sjw think its a unpopular opinion and they can go fuck themselves Amen. This is some good shit right here. I\\'m glad you said it man because this is shit i want to tell people every single day. The world would be immensely better without religion. Im underage and my parents force me to Go to church every Sunday morning i fins It a waste of time too >A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals and started making clay potteries, we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. **The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age.**\\n\\nYou\\'re full of shit, buddy. All those discoveries Man found and made use of also facilitated murder, genocide, and invasions. This was done *eons* before the concept of religion was ever a thing, yet you don\\'t point that out.\\n\\n>Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.\\n\\nExcept genetic research have discovered many biological nuances in different ethnicities. So no, we are not the same.\\n\\n>As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed.\\n\\nThe same science that created the atomic bomb? The same science that is behind mass surveillance threatening our privacy?\\n\\n>Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.\\n\\nAbsolutely brilliant analysis, Lord Edge. yeah fuck god for making us suffer because some bitch ass took a bite from an apple It’s all nice saying all this but the fact of the matter is that the world you’ll I’ve in now has been shaped by religion, from the laws we have to infrastructures and landmarks so it can be said that religion is very much integrated into our society and it ain’t budging. As long as you practice your chosen faith and it isn’t affecting anyone else then yeah you be you. But religion ain’t going anywhere anytime soon soooooooooooooo..... deal with it I guess. \\n\\nAlso don’t think religion is a bad thing, it’s given meaning to many peoples lives and this is where people comment of all the terrorism and wars....\\n\\nListen I don’t deny them but all throughout history there have been humans that do atrocious things, not religion. A philosophy can’t force you to do anything, it’s man that has committed those crimes. E.g Ghent is Khan, hitler - was denounced from Christianity, tried to create his own sect. Etc... Average redditor Sir, this is a Wendy\\'s Amen to that :D no seriously totally agree I believe religions are a for of social psychology I only know that I don’t know Why no rebirth?? We were born already once right?? You\\'re saying that cant happen again?? Goddamn there\\'s so much hatred in this post? Did a priest put something in your butt? Did a Muslim bang your sister? It must suck to have that much negativity and hate you your mind all the time holy shit lol. And yet, at the end of the day, the epistemology of OP is exactly the same as a person of faith. There’s a lot of anger/pain in this post, but ultimately who truly knows with 100% certainty? No one. Humans divide thrmselves among many other factots aside from religion such as politics, race, income and even miniscules things like liking a band or if you\\'re even a \\'real fan\\'. The danger of religion is that not only do not a lot of people respect the authority which is God but people don\\'t even believe in him as you cannot see or hear him and as a result logically it\\'s fuckin stupid to believe in such a ridiculous  notion as God. If religion were to dissappear from this world would the world be a better place-probably not. As humans we will divide and fight with each other over other factors which will cause new problems. At the core of it as humans we always fight and divide ourselves with political and philosophical ideologies that aren\\'t even extreme in nature as well as the ones that are naturally violent and call for violence. Buddhism’s pretty cool but, not really a profit machine just like an intrinsic sorta thing. Idk I’ve always respected it How about Rastafarianism? Ngl India is the most wretched place on this planet. Then life would be pointless. Bet op deals with constant mental issues and isn\\'t far from suicidal. ...on the other hand, imagine how frighteningly overpopulated our planet would now be without the endless centuries of Divinely Deferential human slaughter.\\n\"Attention Please: Converts, brunch is now being served in the dining hall; Blasphemers, report at once to the Client Intake window located in the East Concourse beside Death Pit 47-B.\" I feel like this post is as likely to convince a religious person to drop religion as it is to try and convert OP to whatever religion Funny thing here about the writer of this rant regarding F*** all Religions.. Wonder if he/she in anytime in their lifes had prayed to God for anything.. I believe in a God...I don\\'t have to hear him or see him to know something is responsible for the making of us for better or worse As much as I agree with this statement, it seems you have some historical facts wrong. I may be wrong too, but I\\'m pretty sure we didn\\'t make tools from obsidian (at least that early), homo sapiens migrated out of Africa around 70 000 years ago, we started farming around 11 000 years ago, bricks were invented around 7500 BC and pottery around 30 000 BC, iron melts at 1500°C and was found around 6000 BC. Also I\\'ve never heard of a religion that\\'s trying to take us back to the stone age.\\n\\n\\nAnd yes, I am fun at parties. How can you claim to know what happens after death? You have just as much or less proof for your atheistic, nihilistic, scientific world-view as any religious person does for theirs. Here are some fun facts about Equador. Im not from there but i talked to a girl from there that is a police officer and she told me about some laws and punishments they have for breaking them. The city she lives in is almost entirely atheist. If you get married in a church or you baptise your child in a church you will face 40 years of jail time. I know it sounds ridiculous but for example punishment for killing an animal or even abusing it is 35 years in jail, so i guess it could make sense. In my country on the other habd you got massive protests and religious walks about some law that gives the state right to take tax from churches and its property. Property in question are hotels, beaches, and so on that belong to church and that isnt paying any tax because it belongs ti the church. Dozens of millions of euros goes over those properties and nothing is taxed until now and people are mad because \\'goverment is stealing the holy property to themselves\\'. Like wtf, those priests drive most expensive cars in my country, and yet people that barely even goes to church are defending them blindly like church stands above the state and ni laws apply to it. They want to drag us back couple of hundreds years in the past. So yes. Religion is the biggest problem in the world, and world woukd be much better and more peaceful if there wasn\\'t any religions. Most wars were started because of religion, and all those beliefs in The Bible are pure mythology and fantasy, and it involves a lot if gore and sacrificing of people. Like yeah Noah lived over 300 years and people believe that. If you think this is about religion, you\\'re very sorely wrong. \\nIt\\'s tribalism; My group vs your group\\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with religion and you know it. \\n\\nReligion is God\\'s elicudiation of the proper lifestyle for man. What was best for him.\\n\\nYou\\'re as delusional to believe in evolution (not all evolution) as the reason for humanity existing as it. Is today. You nor any scientist has EVER OBSERVED this type of change in a species over time. \\nWhen you DO LET ME KNOW,  CAUSE IT\\'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.\\n\\nThe people who don\\'t have values and respect for each other are often born into religion. Then they don\\'t care for it so they mold it into something for their own devices. Hence the people who can\\'t understand when to fight and when not to. \\n\\nIslam is around 15% of India. If you expect them to do nothing and not defend themselves you lack as much empathy as the people fightning now. The Catholic church did get on Galileo’s case about his findings back then. I find it ridiculous that the Pope hasn’t condemned the ignorance of the early days of the church on its stance on astronomy and science. But it helps the needy and poor. It also teaches you good morals. /s Tbh youre right but I know that theyre so many bad things threw religion, which also even god hated he hated that we were killing people and then because of the bad things they did he punished them. But still I\\'m a believer I do understand your perspective tho which is also kinda mine. Im still kinda thinking tho but Imma still believe cuz the reward is higher in the long run IF its real so imma end it with amen peace bro. u/userleansbot You\\'re  having that kind of bad day huh .\\n\\nHeard about religious factions killing each other in Indians . Better hope you are right.. This is amazing. Thank you. I want to share it with every religious person I know. I don\\'t know why this much hate on religion without actually knowing one. Religion Fandom is the oldest, You know what\\'s current ? Cristiano Ronaldo Vs Messi, XBOX vs PS4, Castes, Region, Race, Color, etc..See I respect your views that Religion is a problem but Religion is not a problem, It became a problem because we are feeding a radical group called RSS and a Political Party name BJP. Who trying there best to highlight this Fandom of people. It\\'s like One African came into your society and That one aunty who slowly told you one news, fact, history or fake information regarding the situation of African in africa, Slowly that one aunty became a group and one day society committee will bring up the issues and soon that family needs to leave the society. Same If you are bachelor. Even If you don\\'t do anything bad some societies eventually kick you out because some so and so aunty feed the ears of society head that you were doing this and that.. Instead of Blaming the religion, We need to tackle this power.\\n\\nWhen a PM said ,\" You can identify them by their clothes \" \\nYes, No religion teach Hate. No atheism or No Humanity taught you to hate on the basis of anything, be it religion or If you are the fan of Messi and I\\'m of Ronaldo. You making comments on reddit, by using your smartphone maybe, Quote what ? That\\'s like last 200 years or so ? You know how easy a human mind distracts from things ? Did you know that, If your father said to you that Ohh boy use that Radio and listen songs, Your reply would be ,\" No dad, I have my smartphone \". You once used a DVD now not, Everything changes so fast. Science, technology etc. \\n\\nDid you know that religion in human history is one of the oldest and that So called Fandom is still going pretty strong. A human brain, who changes so frequently, throughout eras drop various things but why not religion ? Did you ever try to put your thoughts on that ? Why Religion is the Oldest stuff we got with us. Man People came and go, Many years fall apart, Civilizations come and go, technologies and Everything but this religion is still up in Human Life. \\nSo...I\\'m not an atheist but Whatever..I know someone created us and religion and everything going on is what the creater wishes for. We are in a movie which got a start and end. Watches one hitchens video What evidence do you have for this, that racism is being pushed further from core society. Look around you, racism is also integrated into the very structure of our society. Akala explains this very well if you watch a video of his. \\n\\nAnd remember, racism isnt an actively negative act to most. Religion is held in a different respect, like I said it has given meaning to most peoples lives and only small groups have taken advantage of it and become extremes of it. Truth be told if every religious person was “destructive” and dangerous then the whole world would be screwed because there would a civil war in every country. The truth is that, especially on reddit, people create perceptions of religions that deviate from the truth due to confirmation bias. What most on this site call echo chambers. \\nThis isn’t to say there aren’t any problems in religion. Long time ago I learned myself to manage not to fall in this religion dogma\\'s. \\nBelieve it guys, it\\'s really nice to see around. There are lot to see. Do you realise that by fucking all religions you become an atheist? Do you also realise that even atheists are kafirs? So unless you a paedophilic Mohammed follower, your life will be fucked up anyway. Better fuck Islam. Well said, well said! Agree with most of the comments here. Religions is the main root cause of unsettlements like wars, etc. We cannot deny that it is the inevitable result of our imaginations, the driving force that distinguishes us from other animals. It has contribute towards the advancement of human history.\\nPlease refer to the book Sapiens: brief history of makind. Gives a more insightful and less biased view on religion. I don\\'t particularly like the ideological references in response to violence, I do enjoy their message of peace,harmony and humanity as a brotherhood of one rather then a nation of many. \\n\\nThe Nacaals never taught religion but they did mention the Grand Architect who is also referred to as \"Yahweh, God, etc. \\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate individuals used that knowledge to pursue goals of greed and profit, to turn a coin off information of wealth. \\n\\nWhen we noticed your hearts weren\\'t ready, we rescinded and left, in hopes in the future you could reach ascension and reach a higher vibrational attunement with the cosmos and the Grand Architect. \\n\\nYou humans are so clueless as to what you are and as to why your DNA was programmed in such a manner to exist as a tangible organism and as a energetic electro-magnetic essence which travels through the galaxy using the ambient energy as highways through \"space-time\". \\n\\nKeep searching for answers, keep questioning the obvious, their are forces out their trying to supress your ascension and the consul suggests we not interfere untill you reach your \"pinnacle\". FUCK JUDAISM! Bravo Sooooo... Religion bad... But the industrial age good?\\n\\nHumans have done more damage to the Earth in the past century than all the tens of thousands of years prior combined--and it\\'s not because of religion that we\\'ve desecrated the world. That\\'s for sure. That’s just one article instead of running your keyboard perhaps you should do some research .

SMH. Im sorry for what you have experienced, but not all religion is the same. Some are misinterpretations of Gods word, and many are meant to manipulate.\\nPersonally i have witnessed miracles, and the existance of God is irrefutable to me, but i know that not all have that luxury.\\n\\nAnyone who judges you for non-belief when you havent seen the work of God is mislead, as you are only responsible for what you know. Mike you behind most violence and instigation you\\'ll find atheist who would sometime claim that they follow a certain religion As a christian, cool i respect your religion of no religion. Ew Religious riots like this just continue to fuel my atheism. I sometimes feel this entire world is simulation.  \\n\\nCheck the digital world , we all are communicating in digital form , not physical.  \\n\\n\\nSo what\\'s before physical form? \\n\\nSpiritual form maybe just my guess . well, bro fuck atheist China and North Korea too. (i mean mao kill count is higher than Ashoka Hindu ruler with maximum kill count).\\n\\nalso, our sun may not go supernova (and become white dwarf).   I believe people should follow a religion but not let it define it as what they are. Zzzzzz boring rehashed opinion. People have been saying this forever, it\\'s not revolutionary, just a boring old take. Get some new material. Religion only reflects the true nature of most humans .....weak and gullible....unable to accept death, or for others, life itself..as stupid as it sounds. \"Which is more likely: that all natural order is suspended, or that a Jewish minx should tell a lie? There has to be an answer to this.\" - Christopher Hitchens You sound like a fundamentalist. preach my brother *Sorts by controversial* Preach So you believe a world without religion would be better? What you wrote gives a sense of misinformation. Maybe you\\'re too young to know. \\n\\n\\nAnyway, religion itself is a non-issue, humans themselves are vile and exclusive. If you think atheism would solve anything, you\\'re wrong. Look at China, they are atheists. \\n\\n\\nMany of the idiotic things that we do are driven by religion but if religion were to cease existing, we will latch onto something else. \\n\\n\\nReligion isn\\'t the problem it has never been. Extremism is the problem. People reach these extreme conclusions without proper research or thought process. Facts Sounds like OP is about to lead the atheist religion against all other religions in an non-holy war. How bout people just believe what they want and everyone stops trying to tell/force others what to believe. You sound like someone told you something that you don’t like 😬😂 Religion should never have had ties with worldly powers but in the course of time, it has. In my view, power bestowed to man must not be muddled with religious beliefs. \\n\\nReligion got its bad reputation because of the dominance of religious men in power over the masses. \\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter what religion you are, if you are trying to tie in power with your beliefs then you\\'re most likely not doing it right. >\"Reflect that the dead suffer no evils, that all those stories which make  us dread the nether world are mere fables, that he who dies need fear  no darkness, no prison, no blazing streams of fire, no river of Lethe,  no judgment seat before which he must appear, and that Death is such  utter freedom that he need fear no more despots. All that is a phantasy  of the poets, who have terrified us without a cause. Death is a release  from and an end of all pains: beyond it our sufferings cannot extend: it  restores us to the peaceful rest in which we lay before we were born. \"\\n\\n\\\\- Seneca, Consolation of Marcia\\n\\n[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of\\\\_Consolation:\\\\_To\\\\_Marcia](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of_Consolation:_To_Marcia) Reading this makes me wonder how even more fucked up an atheist country the size of India would be. [deleted] Religion by itself is not a problem but religious extremism or any kind of extremism for that matter is. \\n\\nSimilar to capitalism is not bad but crony capitalism is or socialism is not bad but communist dictatorship is or Patriotism is not bad but nationalism is. Currently reading remembrance of earth\\'s past trilogy. It really seems that we need trisolaris level threat and the proof of existence of a dark forest to finally unite as humans and forget all religions. My man :) Well you are close but forgot one thing, fuck humanity. There is no need to do this bs of making world a better place or whatever that means. This earth, science, climate change and all doesn’t really matter. It is a just biological instinct to think we need to save our species, progress and other bs, overall nothing really matters (atleast there is no evidence it does). Humans have propagated this idea that human life is valuable, we should continue reproducing and then try to keep creating societal and economic structures to live comfortably for no reason whatsoever. What about Pascal’s Wager?\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/BlfX9LNrl6E You can\\'t say 💯 percent surely that God doesn\\'t exist..the probability isn\\'t 0 after all.. Faith is not bad. Religion/institution is Just maybe fuck all religion is not the answer? Be an atheist, believe in a God, whatever makes you happy. But be a good human being first. Do no harm as stated by OP. \\n\\nThe problem with attacking religion so blatantly is that most of the world still believes in something. This is bound to change over time but till then, we can\\'t just say fuck religion and all our problems will be solved. So...ok. What about spirituality? You don\\'t know for sure that everything goes black and we cease to exist. I\\'m not defending a belief in the afterlife at all, just stating a fact. I had the same feelings as you at one point, I still struggle with it tbh. Yes there has been a lot of blood spilled over religions, but there has also been a lot of good things that came from it as well. A good moral code for ppl at the least. I have my doubts about religion but spirituality is a different thing all together. You are judging this life on tangible things in a world we still don\\'t fully understand. Religion could have helped those sheep herders thousands of years ago to fill the gaps of what they don\\'t understand and as far as we have come since then, there is still so much to be explained through science. No one on this plane of existence right now knows what happens for sure after death. Why be another one that says they know what does or doesn\\'t happen then? That\\'s a little hypocritical. One of those gaps in what we understand could explain what will happen to us spirituality (not religiously)  after what we think is life in this reality is over. I don\\'t think there are definite answers to it, so no one can truly say we go here or there or we cease to be. I notice you left out Scientology. Interesting.  hes a little confused but hes got the spirit You bealive in a lot of nonsense why I can\\'t bealive in God. Actually some of the mass genocide weren\\'t made cuz religion. Socialism have killed more people in the last century. If fuck all religion, then what is the purpose of life?\\n\\nWhy do religigion keep appearing?\\n\\nWhy when people are helpless they’re looking for some being to help them? If you are thinking religion is the root cause for all kind of wars you are WRONG. \\n\\nHumans are chaotic in nature just like animals. Humans shed blood even before religion exists. Its just our sixth sense stopping us to do so but its still uncontrollable, in the end human love to war, love to slave others, love to destroy others not belong to their group/race/religion/country/continent/language/direction etc etc etc. all these are just a reason for war, if there is no religion am pretty much sure humans will kill each other for whatever the other reason they can think off. \\n\\nIn the end it doesn’t matter, who are all died are going to get replaced by new births, its not like humans are going to get extinct, i only see it as a way of population control.\\n\\nIf you are smart enough... like me...\\nLet them fight and kill each other.\\nDont get emotional, dont pick side and ioin the war. Just watch them kill each other.

TL, DR Thing is Sikhism is amazing. It just teaches you how to be the strongest version of yourself. Women are queens Men are Kings. Sikhs have been screwed so many times because it’s just a religion that makes you a successful and strong person. Others religions don’t want it to rise. Sikhs don’t attack first there has to be a BIG reason for them to attack.

[deleted] Ok one thing is not believing in religion which I also don’t , but you fucking fuck head who are you to feed people this bullshit ? I have always been against religion and all the problems it brought us , but one thing I know , and if you had hallucionogetics before you would know better , life it’s not just this , bro/sister if you are not religious it doesn’t mean you have to think that life is just this , make your own mind take your own perspective because atheist is another religion for me and another group of fuck heads trying to act like they know the truth of life lol peace I agree but i think Agnosticism  is more of the solution at least in my case because I do believe in God but that nigga don\\'t give a fuck fr so... and we don\\'t understand that meaning in itself so religion makes not sense cause you cant tell anybody shit about God cause we all know the same amount . P.S. In DBZ King Kai is a God and that nigga lets people die on the daily so it makes no sense to the they care. And i speak about caring cause we are selfish beings so if someone don\\'t care about us we no care bout dem. I bet you think you\\'re a genius for writing this. Like really, what a revelation you are bringing us here I am Christian and I used to believe in the same thing as you, but one thing got in my way:\\n\\nIf we die and that\\'s it, were dead how do we remember now? It\\'s hard to even wrap my own head around, but hear me out, if we just die and that\\'s it how can I remember this moment right now? \\n\\nHonestly just a question, not a statement. NOT RECOMMENDED \\n\\nMost atheistic society like soviet union who were anti religion as marx said \"reliong is opioid for masses\"\\nKILLED 40-60 MILLION mostly by fast track courts, starvation. \\n\\nNAZI\\'s absolutely hated orthodox narratives and set out to eradicate suffering endedup killing 40-50 MILLION. Lol I really disagree with the ‘supernova’ part of your comment. The fate of our sun is to become a red dwarf, its not big enough to supernova. The rest seems reasonable. My religion is rajma chawal. It is totally okay if you don\\'t believe in god but why do you have to talk bad about religions just because you don\\'t believe in it. Religion means to everyone something else and thats completely fine. I just don’t understand why people can’t accept that there are people who believe in God or believe in nothing. Religion is not only about what happens after your death it’s also about many other things. If you are born, for example in a muslim family you don’t have to be a muslim you can just convert to an other religion or believe in nothing. I just don’t get it why you have to hate or judge people who are religious or believe in nothing you should just accept them. My dad grew up in a very religious household and was very religious himself. But as he got older, moved out and got married he started to lose his belief, so it is possible to change one’s belief. I am an atheist/agnostic, I don’t believe in God (a agnostic doesn’t normally cut out the possibility of there being one God or multiple God’s but I personally don’t believe in God) but I think that there could be something after death. I believe in what I can see or in what is already proven by science. Still I think all religions deserve the get accepted and respected. I still don’t get why people hate and judge others by their religion or/and belief. I am very nearly one hundred percent behind you only there is this tiny little voice that whispers that bit from the Bible \" the fool sayeth in his heart there is no God\" but organised religion? not worth a damn Why can\\'t you allow people to have their own beliefs. Why be a cunt so if i say anything about my religion im pushing to down peoples throats, BUT when atheist come here and say no religion is true because of science its not considered pushing your beliefs down my throat?? thats just hypocrisy. Relax dude. Religion is a belief I have no problem with that but saying that I should believe in it too and forcing the principles of religion on us is so fkin annoying While I am a strict atheist, I still wonder if religion is necessary for society or not? A religion does not always fucks up everyone, at its core it teaches moral code. Why do people pay beggars? Do they not feel morally obliged? Religion even creates jobs. Tourism is the main industry here. A religion also is a great tool to keep the masses in checks. How many politicians make religion their chief propaganda? India has a population of 1.3+ billion. But since the majority here believes in religion, there is a sincere moral code that is followed here even by those in the lowest ranks of society. And their reason is \"god will not forgive us otherwise\". \\n\\nThus I think that religion need reformation and modernization more so. \\nThe main thing that religions need is to burn their texts. Those unscientific teachings completely make every follower irrational. Then it needs to purge the \"dhongis\". There are some very genuine religious heads who teach the right conduct instead of their donation account numbers. And stop mixing politics with religion. That is the worst thing that can happen. Religion is bad in many ways because political leaders will go to any lengths to appease people. \\n\\nAnd frankly, somehow people are always more eager to listen to all irrational things in religions. Remember those glorious tales of Ramayana and Mahabharta. People want to listen to those because it helps them escape reality. \\n\\n\"People believe people but not necessarily ideals or institutions.\"\\n             ~Yang Wen-Li\\n\\nTherefore religions are inevitable. But genuine leaders can make religions good. The masses do not believe facts, they believe what they want to believe. The only thing missing is the scientific revolution only began ~500 years ago...which means there is no science *in* those archaic (and current) texts. \\nNo mention of all that we can see of our universe. You lost me at \"have faith in people\" [deleted] Only in INDIA Money is also evil. Its actually the root of all evil. It power all politician and religious groups, money also divides us. FUCK MONEY I\\'m open to criticism on this. However,\\n\\nReligion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder? I agree thoroughly with a lot of the points you have made (obviously quite passionately), however to sum up the net worth of religion in society as \\'\\' mass murder and hardship\\'\\' is quite juvenile and quite frankly, false. Science and Religion are separate facets in social lives that are personal to each individual. All major world religions base their beliefs on pre existing human morals and either give them a narrative or an incentive to uphold traditional moral values. I personally believe a breakdown in faith and lack of belief in the preexisting religious moral institution led to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s and look where that left us.\\n\\n\\'\\' Leave your religion\\'\\' - I genuinely hope that was passionate rhetoric rather than what you truly believe. Any anti-freedom of religion country would be morally bankrupt. Freedom of expression and freedom of speech are essential to any working democracy. The same passionate rhetoric in reverse would be condemned by the media as crude conversion tactics. \\n\\nObviously the government should be secular and religion should never be checked in government forms nor in college applications. \\n\\nI\\'ve definetly pissed off a few people. But rather than shouting slogans and holding a pseudo-moralistic stance, what we need in genuine discourse. You\\'ll start believing them once you experience real paranormal things. ;) Spirits/Souls are true. As a Canadian, I feel that you have a right to your opinion but you shouldn\\'t be criticising people for believing something you don\\'t agree on.\\n\\nWho cares if this person believes one thing? Accept your differences and move on. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, we\\'re all human. Don\\'t judge by belief. Hmmm When you say there is evil in this world, you assume there\\'s good. By what standard do you different between good and evil? If we\\'re just matter, there is no evil, there is no good. To have an objective moral law, there should be a Moral law giver. Let me just start off by saying that humans are always looking for idols. This idol has to be a representation of a person. It can be a politician, a teacher, or anything. Indian teens often look at Bollywood celebrities and cricketers as their idols. Therefore, it\\'s a human tendency to look out for idols. However, all these idols are human. When these humans make mistakes, their hard-earned idol breaks. In this comparison to this human idol, the idols of God are the best alternative. They represent perfection, and they can never break. This is because Gods are believed to never make mistakes and always provide the best path in life. That\\'s why people so blindly believe in them.\\n\\nNow that clear, I wanna say that if you want to break religion today, then it\\'s possible. You can truly break these idols. However, I can guarantee you that there will be something that will pop up in the next 100-500 years. It doesn\\'t have to be mainstream religion like today. Science can turn out to be a religion possibly when we discover some fundamental truth, and we can become so arrogant that we will forget to look at other perspectives except the laws of physics. \\n\\nThe reason for this permanent existence of religion is not the blind faith of people but the source of order in our society. In the 12 Rules For Life by Jordan Peterson, Peterson brings a compelling argument that in our world, and possibly the universe, there are forms of **order** and **disorder**.  This is the true meaning of the Chinese philosophical concept of Yin and Yang. The popular symbol of the two white and black fishes. The white represents order, hierarchy, cultures, discipline, faith, traditions while the black represents disorder: freedom, innovation, creativity, disorder, chaos, unpredictability, no-rules. What\\'s so interesting is that you can see this duality around you. I definitely recommend you all to read this book. Note that both sides of the model have positive and negative impacts.  So basically, an ideal society is one that has a balance of both. But historically this hasn\\'t been so. You will observe the whole human race making radical shifts from one state to another. When there are too many wars and there is no morality in people, then a new religion arises and attempts to create peace by asserting codes by which people can adhere to. This is a shift towards order. However, with time, the rules only grow and become overpowering to an extent that the religion may appear as oppression or tyranny. Then our society has a rebel who rallies and breaks the religion restoring freedom and free speech. To do this the rebel takes away all the existing rules. But then after some time, with this new freedom, people lose their moral codes.  They take advantage of this freedom and our whole free society turns out to be a blunder. \\n\\nThe point is that religion or anything in the world is not good or bad. In my perspective, if you promote hate against religion, then there is no difference between you and those religious people who convey the same feelings against atheists and heathens. You are equally as ignorant as them. \\n\\nI completely agree that under religion, so many innocents had to suffer. However, I believe that is not true religion. Religion today has become a tool for politicians to sway public support, at least in India. There are riots, arsons, violent crimes, rapes, torture, and so many atrocities committed to defending religion. There are also these so-called spiritual babas that teach ways of ignorance and bigotry.\\n\\nThe problem arises because people feel that religion is told to them. To me, no Godamn retard can tell me what to do, what my religion is! Religious knowledge or spiritual knowledge actually arises from within. You have to sense your soul yourself. A guru only helps you in recognizing yourself. A soul and consciousness may be meaningless to you, and I respect the opinion. To me, the exploration of this soul is aesthetic and worth it.\\n\\nI believe I\\'m a religious person. I\\'m a Hindu. Yet my religion or my own taking of it doesn\\'t force me to hate other religions. Rather I\\'m quite fascinated by Sufism, and it\\'s my dream to go to the Nizamuddin Dargah. Religion does not make me feel that I matter or that God will come and help me from my misery. While being religious, I just admire the beauty of the world. This is my opinion on it. You can have a different one, and I will respect it. Although, religion is what got us here. To civilization. Whether it is useful now or not is a matter of debate, but humans being the dominant species on the planet is largely a contribution of religion. Religion and spirituality are different. Religion can be more elaborately defined as a way of living or what we call in Sanskrit as \\'Dharma\\'. But most times we forget that if religions did not exist, we would not be where we are now. Religion has played a great role in the development of human civilisation. If one doesn\\'t believe in god, that doesn\\'t mean they should criticize religion. \\n\\nWe turned religion and culture into communalism. That wasn\\'t the true aim. Lol, did you notice how sure you are off your theory. Everything blacks out.\\n\\nDo you know that you don\\'t know a lot about yourself and this world.\\n\\nWhat caused the big bang, how did life originate, what is conciousness,why are you concious of this expirience. \\n\\nThat\\'s the problem with atheists,you do not like any religion you just jump to conclusions like others did.\\n\\nScientists themselves say that they do not know a lot of the universe and it\\'s still very much mysterious. I think there is truth in all of it :)\\n\\nAnd you bet your bottom dollar that the people who run the world believe in religion , very very strictly!\\n\\nBut\\n\\nThere must be something more, evil vs good, dark vs light, hero vs villian you can see this with your own eyes and you can feel it in your guts!\\n\\nIn order for there to be light there must be darkness and in order for darkness there must be light ! It\\'s essentially about being prayerful, that\\'s why you can worship anyone & anything in India cuz it\\'s about our well being. God is just a tool. You should fuck whoever you can wherever you can whenever you can, don\\'t qoute me on tha. u/uwutranslator That might be true might not be true but \\nReligion is a string of hope to hold in to when things get tough and worse. It is just hope. something good to think of when things are bad.Kl Gaming is my religion [removed] Relevant - https://i.imgur.com/B3AC3bv.jpg I too was 13 once Wow this has gotta be dumbest shit i have seen this month or something Cringe This is a stupidly non-informed post.

I don\\'t believe it\\'s true, I don\\'t believe in any religion, but what are they really teaching you? aside from the fucked up history, it\\'s only saying be nice, don\\'t kill people. Honestly, please tell me why you hate it so much? If you say it caused wars, bull shit, men cause wars and use religion as an excuse(BTW, if religion wasn\\'t there we\\'d still have wars). I\\'m not on religion\\'s side but hate is the real problem with religion. People hating others due to their religious beliefs is the real problem. YOU are the problem, not religion. Stop the hate and embrace the good principals they teach. I don\\'t see any problem with religious people as long as they don\\'t affect other people in a negative way. We don\\'t know the cause of consciousness and you have no basis to claim the only thing that happens after death is your body decaying. Oblivion might be your belief but shoving it down everyone\\'s throat is your fallacy. We don\\'t know a lot about a lot of things and dismissing age old wisdom is not always the answer. You sound a lot like an edgy kid. Staunch atheism and \\'rationalism\\' isn\\'t the only way to go. There\\'s a lot wrong with a lot of religions but their main shortcoming is the believers thinking this is the one and only way to do things, and ironically you share this trait. Another person talking about something they never bothered to study.  And many people agreeing who also never studied the subject.  Lots of retards on both sides of the fence Lol, OP, does creativity need to abide by logic for you be benefited? If you can\\'t see past the literal to uncover the absurd truth about this existence, then what are you doing criticizing religion? The self righteous woke-ness is strong in this thread Nothing divides us except religion? What a farce. this isn\\'t facebook, go jerk yourself off somewhere else. Wow.  This is the best they could do after reports of anti-Muslim lynchings. No post about human rights just a post about religion being evil. Maybe not kill your minorities first. No offense this is how it starts. the rage. the feeling of powerlessness, that turns good men cruel. when you question one\\'s faith. \\n\\nyou\\'re no different than the people you oppose.\\n\\nall people are dumb, it\\'s the universal truth. be it anyone, believer or a non believer I\\'m not a religious but I pity you for your onedimensional view o religion as a whole.\\n\\nTbh you seem like a guy who never educated himself in any religion.\\nI know the situation in your country is bad but condemning every religion just because of that is wrong man. Religion isn\\'t responsible. It\\'s the people that want their religion to be the best, the only religion. People suck, not religion in itself.\\n\\nand FYI: Stop calling youself atheists when you are not educated in religion. YES. god damn right! Honestly fuck everyone that\\'s not me. Poor guy got rejected at a Baptist single mingle. Edge Super edgy You’re confused. You described religion the way a child would. It’s not about following certain rules and making sure everyone else does the same. It’s more about community and spreading love. Just because you’re exposed to the violence that is brought about by extremists, doesn’t mean the entire idea itself follows the same mentality. \\n\\nAlso, who are you to explain what happens after death? Last time I checked, none of us have a clue. So I agree that we should live in the moment and cherish it, because it’s all we have. Just admit that you know just as much as the religious,  because otherwise you’re lying to yourself Lmao losers like this actually exist.\\n\\nE N L I G H T E N E D. I am not saying that god is real or anything but there are so many things that are unexplained. Like why space exists in the first place, stuff like that. So may be there is a \\'being\\' out there or may be there isn\\'t who is responsible for our creation. They could be some higher dimensional being or whatever. But at the very least they are not bothered enough to make contact with us or may be they don\\'t even exist anymore. Whatever the case may be, to glorify them saying they have a \\'plan\\' for all of us is stupid. People make excuses in the name of religion just to define their own hatred and heinous acts.   \\n\\n\\nReligion is nothing more but an excuse. Going to need less edge on this post. You are all dumb. I would suggest you to do some thoughtful reading before acting as if you know everything. The book is Homo sapiens a history of us. I partly agree, but religion is probably the reason why the world is as it is now. Religion is what United people, made them work together, think together. All ancient empires/countries/civilizations had religion as their cornerstones, and this allowed people to work and build and think in unity. Read the book Sapiens by Yuval Harari, it\\'s a very good book and explains this in deeper depth.\\n  Edit: its also the reason the government exists An observation, I\\'ve never heard a thiest talk like this. It looks like most religious people tend to be pretty happy and here you are pissed at everything.\\n\\nIf believing in \"stories\" has made them happy and you angry, they reap the benefits of a happy life and you get to whine on the internet. If you only get about 80 years of existence, seems like you\\'re spending a lot of time being pissed. Calm down pajeet This is a really passionate anecdotal that immediately loses the idea of what religion is supposed to be. Death to religion! Sir, this is a Wendy\\'s Love this post. Have been wanting to post something of this sort for the longest time, I’m glad someone did. \\nFuck religion. Religion is one of the main reasons the world is going to shit. Ok edgelord if you want to be down with bad boy, then fuck you too 12 years old is a wild time buddy. Hang in there. sounds like it was written by an edgy 12 year old Cringe\\n\\nIndias problems are because of indians God damn this OP is just a tunnel visioned fuck talking about \"open your mind\". Religion is a set of principles, the adaptation and interpretation by said sick religious fucks is the problem. Humans are the problem. OP, by creating this post, you are the problem because you\\'re having to voice a disdain for religious people, just to be a judgmental POS. You too, do not know the answer to anything, so please, stfu and keep your opinions to yourself. I do not believe in your god \"non existant\" god or the next persons \"existing\" god, but you dont have a right to say there is no god. That is quite literally an uneducated statement. You\\'re sitting there saying \"there is no god how can you be so stupid, you dont know anything!\" while you look like the complete ass due to not knowing universal answers to anything as well. Its just your sad shitty pessimistic outlook on your meaningless life. Oh well, cya. You’re not just wrong, you’re retarded I’m trying to figure out where I asked for your opinion You said Hinduism. So, I will write about Hinduism, nothing else. I think you have a very superficial understanding of Hinduism as a religion. I agree with your rant that all religions have done till now is creating rift and disruption amongst the people of the world. But, that\\'s just a commentary on the aspect of religion followed by the majority of the population and not religion in itself. \\n\\nReligion is not going to temples, not eating beef, reciting mantras, singing hymns, making ashrams, subscribing to gurus and holier than thou attitude. Religion is more than that. There\\'s a beauty to it. The philosophies proposed in Hindu scriptures are mesmerizing and intellectually stimulating. The simple rituals prescribed by the scriptures are nourishing to the mind and body. These are some of the beautiful aspects of religion. It\\'s not degrading, discriminatory or condescending towards anyone. Following the crux of a religion requires no violence or any untoward activity. The philosophies outlined in religion basically provides tools and capabilities for better introspection into our existence.\\n\\nThe question of how and why we are here is the essence of all scientific pursuits. Religion/spirituality is just another way to approach the problem. Thousands of years of spiritual research and development has provided us with tools to understand life a little better. This is an alternative to the approach of going with a blank slate or not thinking about it altogether. It\\'s like scientific research, where the knowledge from the past researcher helps to develop our own theories and understanding about a phenomenon. That\\'s what Hindu religion is supposed to mean, at least to me.\\n\\nI am a proud Hindu. I will always be. To me Hinduism doesn\\'t mean heavens, Gods, Godesses, temples or prayers. I am in love with the philosophical nuances of the religion. That stimulates my scientific mind and helps me become a better human being. That\\'s my opinion. How ignorant and ironic. Fool Making a Reddit post saying \"fuck you\" a lot and telling people they\\'re an idiot for being religious isn\\'t going to change anyone\\'s mind. You\\'re not the first person to do this and won\\'t be the last. \\n\\nAre we really going to tolerate such broad generalizations? I\\'m not one for religion either but seriously. Religion is not the only thing dividing us. Tribalism will always exist, religion or no.\\n\\nIf someone made a post going \"fuck all gays,\" then they would be downvoted to hell, and for good reason. \\n\\nSo why is it good for someone to do the same to another large group of people, most of which are ordinary human beings? You might be right and you might be wrong but one thing is for sure, you’re a dick. Isn\\'t *that* a great way to win allies and convert others.\\n\\n\"Share my belief set or Fuck Off.\"\\n\\nSounds almost- I dunno, religious or something. this site has such a hate boner for religion its actually cringe Wow man you\\'re so smart you\\'ve figured it all out by yourself. 5000 years of debating on the existance of the lord and you pking3, obviously the smartest and wisest being in the universe, have found the definite answer in your very insightful fuck all religion post.\\n\\nThank you and fuck you in the ass for being an absolute teenage retard. I hope after life is real, so I can shit in your fucking mouth for all eternity. You\\'re right: religion has created tremendous hatred and division. It has caused a lot of death and pain. It is also one of the largest contributors to charity of all kinds worldwide, and one of the greatest sources of compassion for people whom society leaves behind. Whether someone who believes in a religion is childish is an individual issue; there is no rule.\\n\\nBut you know what is always childish? Saying, as you\\'re for all intents and purposes saying here, that in spite of physicists\\', chemists\\', mathematicians\\', and biologists\\' inability to describe the exact workings of an incredibly complex universe as ours, you alone, one person, understand the exact metaphysical function of life and death. Not only that, but you\\'re so convicted of your unproven premise that you\\'re bombastically contemptuous of anyone who disagrees. \\n\\nYou sound like a 13 year old who just encountered Richard Dawkins for the first time and wants to be edgy. Sit down. \"Open your mind\", \"religion is the source of hate.\" In a post filled with vitriolic language and hatred towards large groups of people.  Sucks to break it to you, but hatred is a part of all human experience, not just religious people and your post is evidence of that. I don’t think saying “fuck all your religions” unites anyone, but ok. Me sO eDgY aNd sMaRT cAuSe mE nO bEliEve sKy DaDdY TIL india has teen edge lords too! Glad that you have it all figured out. That sure is a long winded and overly emotional way to say that nobody matters. So why waste your timing screaming into the universe that doesnt give a crap about how you feel or your views.... Your insignificant, what you think doesnt mean anything. God still loves you though, and we all pray for a change in your blasphemous heart. Because at the end of days is the worst way to find out that all this time you where wrong your whole life, and eternity is a sure long time to burn in hell over an idiotic opinion. I agree misinterpretations of Religion can cause violence , yes it has been used by some to control \\nThe masses .\\n\\nHowever saying that there is no creator ... it’s all physics and science .... is pure bull shit .\\n\\nWe barely know the workings of quantum mechanics , we barely know what relativity is , we barely even know the universe , there are a lot of answers that we don’t have .\\n\\nThere could be a creator , we don’t know what form , it could be a civilisation or a spirit or light . We don’t know \\n\\nYou just can’t say there isn’t a creator , you could instead say we don’t knowwwww if there is one Did you just turn 13? And who the fuck are you to judge what the rest of the world believes in!! Evidently your the one who is dumber than a box of rocks!! Fuck you. Your a piece of garbage I usually just keep my mouth shut and move on on posts like this because it\\'s obvious that this person has no intention of a discussion they just want to state their belief. I am seriously tired of people like this though. No i\\'m not talking about people bashing religion, you do you, i\\'m talking about people who are either slightly smarter than the average person or who found a idea thought of by someone smarter than them running around stating their theories as facts because they have been able to shut down arguments brought to them by people who have not put any major thought into it. Y\\'all are the reason intellectualism has a stigma.\\nOn top of that the whole reason for \"fuck religion\" is the same argument as blaming a weapon for a murder. People are bad, they do bad things and if you remove the tools they are using to do bad things they will just find new ways. Xenophobia hasn\\'t even been solely acted on because of religion, religions just tend to be the largest cultural groups so attacks between them generally have a greater impact. [removed] Who hurt you, OP? Buddhism isn\\'t a religion. Is science your new religion? [deleted] [removed] If you\\'re truly an atheist, a true atheist in word, thought and acts, then for you there should be no concern at all. Because as per your ideology no one has any choice in any matter as the laws of physics and chemistry coupled with the initial conditions of the Big Bang force people to behave exactly as they do. \\n\\nHence, if you inspite of adhering to this ideology try to comment here, fully aware that everyone is genetically determined, so no one should convince anyone, as freewill is non-existent, and hence getting offended or hurt or disagreement are just illusions of a random oscillation. \\n\\nFurther, if someone wants to blame God, then first accept the existence of God. Don\\'t put blame on someone that as per them doesn\\'t even exist, cause then they\\'re just an emotionally induced atheist, with their roots in emotion not logic, creating principles of evil or good when such principles don\\'t exist in nature. \\n\\nIf however, you first accept God and hence you want to blame him then you should ask the question - Why should people not suffer, including a child, a seemingly helpless animal or any other. Why is it that they shouldn\\'t suffer? When the question of evil arises, the actual subliminal question that people ask is - \"Why isn\\'t God behaving as per my desire?\" I want to live forever he makes me die, I want unlimited sex, he creates obstacles, I want unlimited tasty treats, he creates fat, diabetes, I want unlimited intoxication he creates drug trauma, whatever I want to do, he creates problems? Why? It\\'s because a compassionate father not only treats but punishes when you do wrong. And the wrong is not just for one birth, but cyclical, and accumulative, when you keep ignoring it, it grows and one day it just bursts. When the worm is eaten by a cat, then one may think the worm suffered, but scriptually the jeeva soul in that worm got trasmuted into a sperm and then born as a kitten, and so on the cycle continues. \\n\\nThe desire of fools is material pleasure without any sort of disturbance. Disturbance in enjoying such insignificant pleasure is what is regarded as evil by fools. Death, murder, destruction, disease, and suffering of all kinds is the actual evil and all these evils are sent accordingly by God as per your degree of attachment to such material pleasures. The law of karma works in this way - suppose as per some past act you have to die through a head wound, that karma will make someone who wants to beat someone, who has the desire to beat someone, like a gangster come to you, or you go the gangster, the gangster will beat on the head, and then in the future he too will suffer for murdering someone. In this way one being\\'s desire of beating someone and another\\'s beings deservement both are carried out simultaneously. God will fulfill your desire, no matter how evil it is, one day it shall come to pass, in this life or another, but so will it\\'s consequences. Giving up desires or kaama is the basis of liberation or moksha. Kaliyuga is that age when the pending evil desires of beings is heavily unleashed. It\\'s not God making them behave in this fashion, they want to do it themselves. They like killing babies, they like blowing things up, they like raping and looting, and killing the masses, carving their flesh and drinking till they\\'re dead, and birth after birth they keep suffering. \\n\\nOut of all the wars, murders, crimes almost all of them have one or more of these 3 motives - \\nLust, Anger or Greed, all of which are categorically curbed in any bonafide religion. \\n\\nHolocaust, Holodomor, The Cambodian genocide\\xa0of 1975, The Armenian Genocide of 1915, the Zunghar genocide etc. which killed 7 times more people than the two world wars combined have been done by the irreligious. You\\'re doing the same thing which you accuse religion of - Collective hate. \\n\\nAs for the OP, I\\'m not here to convince anyone, but to say that please behave as per the ultimate conclusions of your own ideology, which is Atheism here, like a random oscillation with no friends or enemies, with no concept of good or evil, as such concepts are imaginary as per the same logic applied. Please practice such atheism ardently. Also, yeah I post at a sub that many people here are averse to, and yeah its because atleast I can say my say over there. Thank You. These kind of liberals are a threat to society. Who just call out and say everyone is equal culprit and don\\'t take a side. These are the liberals who will send an apology after a pogrom and genocide is done. These are the one that give intellectual validation to the extreme right wing. Under the soviet and communists who are majority atheists we have seen far more genocides and these people have hidden. it very well from rest of the world. China Russia have killed more people in the name of religion\\n\\nRandia loves these liberals who just wants to put us into the same mess. Will no religion change things for India? Definitely no.\\n\\nIndias problem lies in casteism. Even if you are a atheist you will continue to look down on people who don\\'t follow your ideas or belief. There are atheists in developed countries but there thinking will never match the Indian casteist thinking. Because in European countries a person can work hard defy his status. But in a casteist society people will always find a way to keep there superiority. You a don\\'t have money but you have caste this makes you superior because you are born with the caste. This gives you reason to look down on those who have money and also those who don\\'t have money.\\n\\nThis casteist mentality should go. Today the mentality is to look down at Muslims as the lowest amongst the society. Very soon this will come to haunt you liberals as well. I believe it\\'s the lack of knowledge about a religion not the religion itself which has divided humanity. from what i believe  religion actually tells you how to actually be a good person\\n\\nfor example: respecting your elders ,teachers,your loved ones.\\n\\nwell according to the bhagavad gita krishna is the universe and when krishna gave the divine eyes to arjuna .what he observed that there were infinite forms of krishna indicating that the universe is expanding ( which is true according to the astronomer edwin hubble).\\n\\nnow in terms of living in the society; Religion also tells about different characteristics of a human being-\\n\\n1. mode of goodness\\n2. mode of passion\\n\\n3 mode of ignorance\\n\\nnow following religion also gives you inner piece (eg; chanting \"ohm\" brings inner piece in yourself   and makes you feel more connected and relaxed).\\n\\nyou would actually understand this when you through some books about religion\\n\\nbut yea there are some negative aspects too and i am totally against that (eg: committing fraud and making money through religion). Saying \\'Fuck all religion\\' on Reddit is like saying \\'Nazis suck\\' to a Jew ( or well, anyone with a brain because Nazis do suck, period.)\\n\\nBut you get my point. It\\'s basically preaching to the choir.\\n\\nPersonally, I am spiritual. Not sure if religious but definitely spiritual. I have seen the capacity of religion and spirituality to do good. Yes, a lot of people-in-power use it for their own personal ends and many corrupt their original teachings but that doesn\\'t negate the numerous truly good religious people in the world.\\n\\nFaith is a fickle thing. It truly gives some people purpose. And I\\'m not referring to the ones who corrupt it and use it for violence, no. I\\'m talking about normal, everyday people who wish to go about their lives being decent human beings.\\n\\nNo religion, by itself, promotes violence, murder or hurting your fellow man ( as far as I am aware). It\\'s a tool that was intended to keep people from turning bad. And tools can be used for both good and bad.\\n\\nSaying \\'Fuck all Religion\\' is easy to say to an Atheist-majority community. The same way it\\'s easy to say \\'Fuck all Hindus\\' to a group of Islamic extremists or \\'Fuck all Muslim\\' to a group og Hindutva extremists. It\\'s just a different form of hate.\\n\\nWhat is hard is actually looking into what various religions offer people and why they resonate with people the way they do and maybe then enter into discourse and understanding. I know u r saying this as u r watching what\\'s happening in our country. When it comes to religion, people of power deceive and manipulate the general public to continue enjoying power. Look at the positive side of religion. I was brought up in a family where my parents r atheists and follow Marxism (As Marx said Religion is the opium of the masses; I agree with the statement) but I became a theist.\\nEvery religion is based on some common values giving up materialism, power, greed and rest everyone knows.\\nReligion may play a big role in the current conditions of our country but u know anyone who truly understands any religion will give up their worldly lives. There r many cases in atheists have been the cause of genocide, take examples of Lenin and Mao. This is not a matter of religion, religion is just instrumental and a tool for these political goons to unite muscle power towards other particular minorities.\\nIf there is no religion and God specifically we r left behind with the Existential question why r we here?, and any sane mind will never believe we r random product of our universe and the universe cant come into existence from nothing. I have studied years of science and philosophy.\\n\\nUltimately if there is no God our existence is meaningless and everything we do is meaningless and the Greatest of humans who gave lives for our country all r meaningless (and I don\\'t think u think so). \\nTherefore don\\'t look at the surface and judge things go deeper. \\nAs Einstein said \"Atoms r easier to break than Prejudices\".\\n^_^ https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/29/winston-churchill-policies-contributed-to-1943-bengal-famine-study\\nAnother one Lol As an indian I’m surprised that India is going through this extremism. We have a booming economy and a booming middle class. That’s supposed to bring the extremism down but the opposite is happening. \\n\\nI would also like to say that while you may disagree or hate what’s happening. You have to show that disagreement with respect. Don’t abuse people’s choices and faith. Like someone smart once said. “If there wasn’t a god, we’d have to invent one.” Some people have god and nothing else. If you disagree with religion that\\'s fine, but no need to attack religion like that. Your dumbass is like 100 years late [deleted] Only 2 religions made the chaos on this planet. Fuck Buddhism.  Buddhism is installed by chinese emperors in mongolia to control mongolian population and it did worked in 1910s 50% of mongolian mens were monk who can\\'t marry or have sex/kids and most 50% population had HIV related disease caused by chinese merchants. To say you know nothing happens after death is just as crazy to say you know what happens. I disagree heavily. People can believe what they want to believe. My religion plays an important part in me being a better person, and so do others. We coexist, and that’s okay. Why are you being rude and disrespectful? Religion may divide but it also brings us together. For example, the DL and the pope prayed together. Religion brings peace and order, and if you don’t want to believe in it, that’s your choice. But you have no right to disrespect others for believing in it. If religions are only man made, then all of the ills that you are highlighting are likewise man made. \\n\\nIt isn’t religions that are the problem, because they don’t exist without *people*. So sensitive, take the tampon out your ass No one asked. How dare you insult many people for engaging in a culture that is important to them? As a someone who studies religion I find it disgusting that you pour all this hate onto peoples heritage and cultures. \\n\\nIt is true that religion can cause issues, and that some people do heinous crimes whilst claiming to be religous. But you cannot defame all religious people for the acts of the few.\\n\\nThere are atheists who have raped and killed but i would not say that all atheists are rapists and killers. I respect atheism just as I respect theism, you should too. No one fucking cares about your shitty opinion. Why do the atheist say “Lord have mercy” in times of distress? No, you are wrong. The very action of believing something is real can make it real if you really think about it. Why do you have a problem with what is true to others and false for you? Thinking that your beliefs are true are fair but only for you. Yes there are many bad aspects to religions but they also act as great moral guidelines for people. I grew up Christian but never took anything literal like Noah’s ark. I am STILL glad for what I learned though, because it taught love a compassion towards other human beings. You aren’t wrong or right, but you cannot force you narcissistic black nothingness when you die view on others, just like they cannot force their religion on you. Agnostic here. I don\\'t personally believe in God but I\\'m open to the idea that there might be something after death...unlike athiests who out right deny all religion.\\n\\nThere\\'s no evidence to suggest that an afterlife exists, but there\\'s also no evidence that it doesn\\'t.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI know plenty of people who are sick, ill, broken individuals barely keeping their lives together and the idea of an afterlife or higher presence puts them at ease. Going to church and being part of a community of people helps with their mental health and gives them the support they need sometimes. I know plenty of churches who have pastors that go out of their way to help poor families and people physically ill or hurt emotionally, suicidal folks and such. When I was a kid our house in Florida got wrecked by hurricane Andrew and the church came out and helped repaired it, even gave us food.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYou don\\'t believe in God? That\\'s fine, neither do I. However don\\'t be an ass about it and attack people who do, it\\'s childish and just plain discrimination. It makes you no better than a homophobe who lashes out at someone for their sexual preferences. Ok, cool. But mind your business and I\\'ll mind mine. Thanks bro. First off you are very aggressive I can’t really even understand your point when it sounds like your yelling with how you wrote second off yes some religions aren’t helpful some are bad but then there are some that are good even if they may not be true there are other benefits to the people apart of the faith and yes maybe not all religions are without blood on their hands but that is very subjective, Christians have killed people yes but not all branches of Christianity were involved. Times are different no big religion (except Islam) seeks to kill people or hurt them there are many benefits the followers get, it gives them something to believe in and it helps them emotionally mentally and physically with that belief, maybe next time don’t be so aggressive \\n(I am an orthodox Christian) Hinduism is not a religion. Its a civilization. Religion is a concept alien to India.\\n\\nCivilization is something that evolves over time. Our scriptures were written by thousands of people over thousands of years. Parts of our scriptures become outdated with time and new ones were written. We accept that somethings in our scriptures were wrong. \\n\\nThis means Hinduism is very robust and it is the only one to have  survived the test of time. It is cherished. You spelt steel wrong. *than Yeah fuck people that use religion to keep a positive outlook on life. Such a horrible thing.  Good thing you\\'re on Reddit to tell everyone how bad religion is. Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]? [52:35]\\n\\n\\nOr did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain. [52:36]\\n\\n\\nI encourage you people to read Qur\\'an, most of people have not read it even lot of muslims, for it is indeed from God Almighty. There were books and scriptures from God before Qur\\'an but they were altered and changes were made by people over time, but Qur\\'an is same as it was when it was revealed approximately more than 1440 years ago. May Allah guide us towards the right path. Religion is not a harmless belief, I’m not even convinced that such a thing even exists.  For even if you somehow removed religion from all the witch hunts, inquisitions, holy wars, and so on it still comes with false beliefs.  \\n\\nFalse beliefs that teaches that we are born broken beings in need of redemption from god, that we can’t possibly reason without god, that we can’t have a functioning morality without a god, that there’s an in group and an out group and we don’t want to be part of the out group, that we’re somehow at the center of the universe, that we’re better than all of the other created beings, and an infinite number of equally inane and false beliefs besides.\\n\\nWhat part of this is in any way harmless? What a bunch of crap. Yeah I lose respect immediately for religious people because clearly you can’t take important issues seriously enough to give it critical thought. And fuck you too! Nobody cares about your miserable experience. Lmfao, edgy as fuck Can’t speak for the other religions but you clearly know dick about Hinduism. While I agree with the point this post is trying to make, I can only counter with this thought:\\n\\nReligion is there to help the weak feel important. To help the lost find direction. It is not something that I have ever needed, but I understand that some people just can\\'t accept reality. Do I pity them? Sure. But mostly I feel bad for all the kids that get force-fed this stuff for their formative years only to have any semblance of choice removed entirely. I overheard a few religious zealots in Chipotle the other day talking about how they tend to lose some of the kids when they get to about 6th grade as they start to question the teachings, and that they really needed to double down on their efforts to lock down \"harmful free-thinking\" prior to that time in their lives to better increase their chances of extracting tithing from them as they got older. Kinda gross, if I\\'m honest.\\n\\nDon\\'t really know where I was going with this comment but here we are. More like fuck Islam. Hinduism is mystic and ethereal with useful yogic methods and philosophy. \\n\\nIslam is just a political collectivist cult masked ad religion. Literally nobody asked for your hateful opinion; atheists like you who shit on religion and other beliefs like this actually make me embarrassed to be unreligious.\\n\\nI wish you knew that religion provides moral and emotional support for those that actually need it. It brings meaning into their lives and keeps them happy. I’ve seen atheists become MUCH better individuals after converting. It’s not just about believing in a God. It’s also about self-improvement.\\n\\nYou’re shitting on it because you think you’re an intellectual superior. You’re not; I guarantee you if you act like this in real life no one is going to like you. \\n\\nActually fucking cringe. I couldn\\'t care less about God and I\\'m not discussing whether he exists or not. So, what i wanted to say is, the problem is not religion. The problem is within the human nature. Most people are nice and decent because they fear Hell, want a reward after death, or simply fear  getting put in jail. Remove these fears, and all these civilized people will eat each other. Imagine religion doesn\\'t exist. One day, the government makes a public statement that within the next 12 hours, everything is legal. Murder, rape, theft, you name it. What do you think the streets will look like then ? No one cares you are not better than everyone else. Get off you reddit high horse and go back to r/atheism where you belong. Here\\'s the problem with everything you\\'ve had to say. Although you don\\'t want to believe in a god, that. doesn\\'t mean you\\'re gonna force atheism on everyone else now. Take Sikhism for example, everything isn\\'t about believing in god, a large majority of the religion just teaches you about respect, honesty, integrity, empathy, and many other characteristics you should have anyways. Your approach is really bad, be an atheist if you want, but that doesn\\'t mean you\\'re going to force it down everyone else\\'s throat. Stopped reading halfway through. I’m not religious or a believer either but I don’t scream at people about it. Nobody has the answers. Fuck atheists. Fuck their arrogant, narcissistic viewpoint that they know what happens after death, an experience they\\'ve never had. Fuck their need to embellish their superiority for \"knowing the truth\"\\n\\nHard to ever convince someone to change with extreme sentiment like that isn\\'t it? Hard to actually strike up a conversation with such extreme views isn\\'t it? \\n\\nTruth be told no one knows for sure what happens to you when you die. It\\'s why religion exists, to give people peace of mind over something we have troubles even comprehending or knowing as the experience itself is usually permanent. Some people believe we are nothing more than flesh and blood, spawned here to do nothing but reproduce, pass on our traits, and die. Others believe we are more than just meatsacks and that there is a purpose to all this. Religion at least shows some openness to the idea of spirituality, or at least a willingness to think about and discuss it. Why is that such a bad thing? I ONLY LOVE ALLAH NO OTHER RELIGION, I AM ALLAHIST  First humans didn’t come from Africa mate Buddhism is a teaching not a religion. He was a man, not a god. Do not judge that which you do not understand. You missed an important word .. Fuck all ORGANIZED religion. Just because people us religion as an excuse doesn’t mean the religion is causing those terrible things. Evil people will do evil way whether they have a religion or not. Wow so edgy and deep Atheism is a religion, so fuck atheism as well Fuck you nigga The cringe is real. ye and i will fuck you and your stinky indian mother XD \"This ONE fairy tale, this one is real.\" Is how I feel about religious people. well fuck u too bitch This is the edgiest post I\\'ve ever seen. Fuck you asshole stupid indian Cocaine is fun but you need to cut back some Fuck you This guy has clearly never done dmt. He also speaks like he knows anything. You dont know anything and your claims as to what happens after you die are unfounded, ignorant, and unresearched. Fuck you, you know it all pseudointellectual twat. Also, inversely I love you and your teenage mind. You\\'re ignorant to believe that. You know how fucking insane it is that\\'s we\\'re even here right now? You know what\\'s more unbelievable than an afterlife? Fucking LIFE. THIS LIFE. You don\\'t know shit, I don\\'t know shit, nobody knows shit except for the ones who have died. Best not to go around being a piece of shit if you can\\'t ACTUALLY back any aspect of your argument up. STFU stupid ass!! Looks at atheist north korea, soviet union, china.... well that did not go well. Cringe You know all these so called facts are merely hypothesis. I know that I for one am genetically a descendant of Neanderthal who were in Europe for at least a couple million years. And those same people had already discovered fire.... In fact research shows that homo erectus could use fire. Cringe bro, all the shit you said is such uneducated garbage, I actually started to believe you were going to make a point that made sense somewhere. It\\'s due to fear of the uncontrollable. Every single human wants to have control over every aspect of their lives, so that they can prevent bad things from ever happening to their loved ones.\\n\\nThe idea that bad things can happen to them, for no fault of their own, with no way to control or prevent it is terrifying to people.\\n\\nSo terrifying that they\\'ll rather believe anything else - including fictional omnipotent beings (god), fictional omnipotent forces (reiki, vaastu, feng shui etc.), karma, multiple lives, rebirth etc.\\n\\nIt\\'s a widespread, unacknowledged mental health problem. All of these people have severe anxiety and fear, and need counseling/therapy. Wow you’re so edgy You’re not an atheist. Your religion is shitting on streets. Well, angry... In all honesty it\\'s great to have an opinion. Although, religion itself has caused nothing, It\\'s used to justify why people murder, otherwise it would have been over other reasons like land, money or power. As long as there are bad people, acts of hate and crime will forever exist. Some people need a beleif in a higher power to help justify a reason to be good, a reason not to murder or steal.\\n\\nThank you for reading my crappy comment and have a fantastic day! Wouldn\\'t accept such an emotional speech. Religious people can use emotions againt you too. So much ignorance in one post and the comments below. God (or whatever) save the future of this planet with such wannabe fools. > You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe.\\n\\nThat\\'s literally a part of Buddhism. You can\\'t just lump all religions together because a couple of them piss you off.\\n\\nI don\\'t disagree with you. I just can\\'t agree with you either. Who cares, fuck you [deleted] So , to anyone reading this one out of thousands of comments . Hey ! I would like to tell you that you matter . Never let stuff get in your head . Your faith is yours , you have the right to practise ,profess and propagate it . Religion is a concept that helps cope millions in their time of desperation and about the blood . People have killed each other over food , do you stop eating it totally ? No , because its a savage (man this word has lost meaning nowadays) humans instinct to kill . And they will believe in any bullsh*t reason to do so . sheesh, op is trying to compensate for a super small dick here so hard it\\'s funny I agree 💯% with you.But here\\'s a little known fact: There was no such thing as religion in the Indian culture. You see, there\\'s no such word as \"Religion\" or \"The God\" in Sanskrit. Hinduism isn\\'t a religion, it\\'s a culture. What’s in it for you? Let people live how they want, no one need to listen to your sorry ass What did Buddhism do? Pretty sure that whole thing is just based on “This dude chilled so hard once that he he ran out of fucks to give” Jesus fuck, who pissed in your cereal #FUCK U TOO how people are free to type long messeges 😂 I don\\'t agree.\\n\\nUntil today I will never understand why people cannot live and let live because everybody is allowed to believe in what they want and also to practice what they want.\\n\\nReligions have a personal meaning for every human being and this should be accepted because it is also okay if you think that there is no God and you just want to talk yourself into believing that there is no God. This is also your own opinion which you should keep for yourself and not try to convince everyone as the right one. Although what seems to be right for you doesn\\'t have to be so for the other person. In my opinion a religion serves the people not only to form something beautiful after death - there is much more to it. If you believe there is no God then you feel this personally and you don\\'t have to shout that all this is stupid and nonsense.\\n\\nI myself am religious, but I also accept people who do not think that way, several people should do it slowly and understand and not rush against everyone. How do you know all this? What’s so bad about having faith? You just look depressed af. There’s no need to knock anyone because they choose to believe in something based on faith. It’s not like religion is the only thing that has caused war in the past. In the past, humans found whatever reason they could to kill each other, the world is undeniably more civilized than it was hundreds of years ago. Nothing is perfect buddy, religion is not perfect. Science is not perfect. Just let people believe what they want to believe and maybe there would be less polarization and less violence in the world, how about that? This smells like a copypasta. Keep calm and carry on. No one would fuck with you for being an atheist in India. But a Muslim friend from India told me, abusing Islam would definitely get you killed. Okay, I think we can have interesting talk here. I know the bible very good, and I AGREE with the complaints you have against what the other religions are teaching about.\\n\\nDeath\\n\\n For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all, nor do they have any more reward, because all memory of them is forgotten. \\xa0Also,  their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished, and  they no longer have any share in what is done under the sun.\\n\\n  Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might, for there is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave, where you are going.  \\n\\n## Ecclesiastes 9:5,6,10\\n\\n**Reincarnation Phenomena Explained**\\n\\nONE of the objections to the theory  of reincarnation is that the vast majority of people on earth have no  recollection at all of having lived before. Furthermore, they do not  even think that they could have lived earlier lives\\n\\nHell\\n\\n The Hebrew word *Sheol,* which referred to the “abode of the  dead,” is translated “hell” in some versions of the Bible. What does  this passage reveal about the condition of the dead? Do they suffer in  Sheol in order to atone for their errors? No, for they “know nothing.”  That is why the patriarch Job, when suffering terribly because of a  severe illness, begged God: “Protect me in hell \\\\[Hebrew, *Sheol*\\\\].”Job 14:13; *Douay-Rheims Version*)  What meaning would his request have had if Sheol was a place of eternal  torment? Hell, in the Biblical sense, is simply the common grave of  mankind, where all activity has ceased.\\n\\nheaven\\n\\n **The Little Flock**\\n\\n Who,  then, make up this little flock having such a wonderful prospect? The  followers of Jesus Christ who receive an anointing with holy spirit. (Acts 2:1-4)  Seeing them as heavenly singers with harps in their hands, the apostle  John wrote: “I saw, and, look! the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion,  and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand having his name and the  name of his Father written on their foreheads. These are the ones that  did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins. These  are the ones that keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes. These  were bought from among mankind as first fruits to God and to the Lamb,  and no falsehood was found in their mouths; they are without blemish.”\\u200b—Revelation 14:1,4,5\\n\\nGreat Crowd\\n\\n  What does John see? “A great crowd, which no man was able to number, out  of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the  throne and before the Lamb.” **(Read Revelation 7:9-14 We have seen the gathering of millions whose hope is to live on the earth forever.\\\\` God\\'s original plan for mankind**\\n\\nReligion and War\\n\\n  Christians  are not authorized to fight against their enemies. The apostle Paul  wrote to fellow Christians: “If possible, as far as it depends on you,  be peaceable with all men. Do not avenge yourselves.”\\u200b—Romans 12:18,19\\n\\nInstead  of sending his followers to war, Jesus told them: “Continue to love  your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you, so that you may  prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens.” (Matthew 5:44,45) Even when the nation in which they live goes to war, Christians should remain neutral, “no part of the world.” (John 15:19)  If God wants his worshipers in all nations to love their enemies and  to remain separate from the world, how could he support either side of a  violent conflict today?\\n\\nFree Will\\n\\n God also gave us the mental abilities, such as the powers of perception,  reason, and judgment, that work in harmony with free will. These enable  us to think, weigh matters, make decisions, and distinguish right from  wrong. Hebrews 5:14)  We were not created to be like mindless robots that have no will of  their own; nor were we created to act primarily out of instinct, as were  the animals.\\n\\n Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are going in through it; [\\xa0](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070144/23446)whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it.

What is this hateful trash Hurr Hurr im a edgy atheist hurr hurr. Fuck off. I dont believe in any religions. However, I dont think we can simple say that all religions are bad, the world would be a better place without it.\\n\\nBad thing happened with or without religions.\\n\\nReligions are something happened in human history, fit for the time when they was created,  with their own value and limitation.\\n\\nThey are still alive now, which means their historical misson are not finished. The time has not come. Accept it. Just to clarify, Hinduism is not a religion but a way of life.\\n\\nP.s. I do not associate myself with any religion. Religion without science is blind\\nScience without religion is lame - Albert Einstein.\\n\\nJust my two cents. If you cant prove that God exists, you certainly can\\'t prove he doesn\\'t. \\n\\nAtheism is in fact a faith. A faith that there\\'s no God.\\nAnd sure some really bad things are done in the name of religion, but some very very bad things that happened were irrespective of religion. WW2 for instance, or Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \\nDownvote if you want, but this is reality and there are a few true atheists, majority are just sheeps following what\\'s cool and after the idea their actions have no consequences. What so ever. Watch what your hatred has turned you into, the exact thing you hated. And I obviously speak only philosophically. The only difference between them and you is that you hate just one more religion than them. If I were to extrapolate your being into a more agressive and affirmative one, you\\'d be with them with your guns and shooting them both. \\nBelief and disbelief are equally harmful. It\\'s not the belief in their god(s) that makes people kill in the name of religion but the disbelief in other\\'s. \\n\\nI\\'m disappointed in you. Fuck ALL religions?\\n\\nOh how egalitarian of you.\\n\\nOk enlightened centrist.\\n\\n\\nEdit: please continue to downvote me while awarding centrists. Keep doing that. That\\'s why we are here and why we will stay here for a long time. Even if we get out we will eventually come back to this place. Good work. Nope. Violent people will be violent regardless of religion. There\\'s no shortage of violence committed in the name of atheism either (communists etc). Definitely should be here r/unpopularopinion Religion solves real problems, traditions are smart solutions to old forgotten problems, idk I’m from America so it’s easy to say this, but this is one of the least “speak truth to power” things you can say, you’re on reddit after all, the utter home of atheism. Dude, don\\'t apply the same label of Sanatan Dharm on other ideologies. Or, rather, specifically, Buddhism. Yes, I\\'m a Buddhist and I claim that you clearly haven\\'t read anything about Buddhism to be whining and shaming the ideology in this manner. And no, Buddhism is not a religion. It\\'s just an ideology. And no, I don\\'t give a penny\\'s fuck about what Wiki says, what Dictionary says. As someone who has been following Buddhism for her entire life, allow me to inform you that it is not a religion. Keep your stupidity away from its name. my sympathies Anyone who thinks religion is made up be it any I am talking about the concept of God or a maker here explain what\\'s 0+0 ?? 🤗😂🤦🏽\\u200d♀️ Yup that\\'s what I thought I entirely agree with you however the deeper question is not what is after death. It is why the universe is here and how/why it was formed. I agree crediting a god for the phenomenon of existence is low effort. Science will ultimately work hard give us concrete forms of an answer. However from a philosophical point of view there are certain questions which will likely always remain unanswered. If time is a construct of the universe being in its current state, what is the universe\\'s true form and can we know it? Where did it come from? Why? These trouble people and I agree that religion takes the mind away from the question and life. Your post was so well written and I hope you\\'ll enjoy this point as well.\\n\\n^(I want be explicitly clear that I am not referring to question of why an given human is here but rather the universe ) It\\'s clear OP follows Judaism. He didn\\'t mention it. I think I saw this same rant in Ready Player One. I understand that you\\'re pissed, I am too. But blaming what happened or whatever bad happens is like blaming Biology for Coronavirus. \\nI don\\'t know if you go to college, office, school, etc, but people of different cultures, religions, regions, etc work/study together. You don\\'t normally see them killing each other over religion. Why do riots happen? Who participates in riots? First analyse the situation, people involved, people who started it or provoked it. \\nLook I could have taken offense when you wrote \"F* Islam\", but I didn\\'t because I know that you\\'re pissed and me giving you the finger on the internet is childish. Religious extremism is really bad because it distracts you from the actual religion that you\\'re following. Extremism teaches you exactly the opposite what the message religion wants to convey. It would be more appropriate if you abused ISIS. \\nThose people who think that by killing people of other religion is okay will be acceptable by God, they couldn\\'t be more wrong. They will be punished. Everyone\\'s time will come.\\n\\nI see many comments here who are against religion and calling it a scam. Maybe you\\'re right, maybe you\\'re wrong, but I\\'ll say this, you go your way, I\\'ll go my way, whenever we will meet, I\\'ll greet you with a smile.\\n\\nJai Hind. op are you okay ? Lol, another angsty teen. How do you know there is no god? Your hate in religion is a religion in itself. Cool your jets bro. You are probably at the lowest part of the social triangle, and you probably deserve it would you look at that ! baby\\'s atheism phase Dumbass energy flows, and time only grows. It would be kinda stupid if there is nothing after life, so all this shit you wrote is nonsense A higher power exists Atheists and misled orthodox are both toxic to the truth if you ask me Brother, I’m a muslim, i may be corrupt but my religion is not! Please stop taking wrong people as the ambassador of any religion. There are good people in all religions! Lmao at the atheist cope. Buddhism is not a religion. Look know angry you are! You realize that atheism is a belief structure in itself, right? \\n\\nI used to be constantly amazed with evangelical atheists until I realized this. Lol so you know there is no god. What a fucking joke. What did Christian ever do to you? May Allah have mercy on you. This is clearly coming from someone who is mad all the time and has a sad life. Nothing to see here Fuck Hinduism Hinduism is not a religion Stupid hindu piece of shit with your bullshit rhetoric of hate. You\\'re not any better than these hindu nationalists for thinking exactly like them \"fuck islam\" is the root cause of hate in this shithole country and you come to reddit to preach this. Have some common decency you fucktard As a Muslim reading about what is happening to Muslims in Idia right now, you really want me to believe we are the bad ones? Or I could point out the genocide happening to us in China or the countries taking turns bombing the crap out of the middle east.\\n\\nBut none of that would compare to the evidence that the Quran has to offer about the perfection of Islam. Haters gonna hate. Isn’t science technically a religion? May God open your hearts. “They all just want to believe in something good after death.” \\n\\nI think you’re forgetting about the most terrifying prospect imaginable - an eternity of torment separated from God and the possibility of relief from suffering. I suppose many religious believers begin their spiritual journey preferring total annihilation after death to a belief system like Christianity that allows for such a horrific potentially.\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that you know that God exists. You simply do not wish to accept him on his terms. You want your sin more than the truth, so you rage against God and all who follow him (however imperfectly) hoping you find comfort in likeminded individuals, of which you’ll find plenty on reddit.\\n\\nThat said, we’re all sinners in need of forgiveness, and it’s never too late for a living person to ask Jesus Christ to open their eyes to the truth of his gospel. There is a way to escape God’s judgment, and it is in the person of his son, Jesus Christ, who lived the perfect life you and I could not, went to the cross and died as a substitute sufferer of God’s wrath that you and I deserve, and who rose from the dead, having satisfied God’s wrath against the sin of all who put their faith in him and submit to him as Lord. It’s only then that a person can expect “something good after death.” Fuck atheism. Fuck all of those who do not believe the truth. Jesus Christ died For you too, but you refuse to believe it. You See the truth but you decide to ignore.\\n\\nAlso the reason for most of the wars that were because of religion actually weren\\'t. Most of em came to be because of resources. Religion was nothing but a made up reason. Human is a greedy being\\n\\nAtheism is evil. Religion is good. But why do you care so much, couldn’t u mind ur own business and just let people live Religion is a belief... as is Atheism. \\\\>  Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension.  \\n\\nNope, fuck off. Crazy bastard. Cringe You mad, bro? > Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so\\n\\nHey Atheist hypocrites, how about take your own advice. \\n\\n> You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.\\n\\nAnd stop acting like life matters. Stop complaining about suffering if none of this shit matters. Lolololol\\n\\nFor us life matters and the kind of life we live matters because that’s the ideology we believe in. You tell us it’s all man made. Ok let’s say we believe you. Now tell us exactly how you can objectively prove with evidence that life matters and all of your bitching about suffering isn’t just an emotional and subjective rant. Prove to us with evidence that your morality itself isn’t a product of your surrounding and the times we are living in i.e man made. \\n\\nIt’s quite telling for a movement to claim rationality by appealing to people’s emotions. How does that work exactly, you know because emotions are biased and subjective. You can\\'t exactly use them to prove or disprove anything. Lol soyboi is mad How about no? Fuck aww wewigion.

The main issue is identity politics. How Avicenna ‘prove’ God/Allah/Bhagwan exists\\n\\n“The full argument is a bit complicated, but here is a somewhat simplified version. Avicenna’s proof actually has nothing to do with design, he doesn’t need the idea that the universe is intelligently put together. Instead, he argues from the idea that the things we see around us are ‘contingent’ or merely ‘possible’.\\n\\n“The idea here is that a contingent thing is something that may either exist or not exist; its nature does not guarantee that it exists. What Avicenna wants to do is show you that although all the things we experience directly are indeed contingent, there is also something else that exists necessarily, in other words, whose very nature guarantees that it exists.\\n\\n\\n“To do this, Avicenna points out that since a contingent thing on its own merit could either exist or not exist, it must have some external cause that made it exist - like ‘tipping the scales’ in favor of its existence rather than its non-existence.\\n\\n\\n“So take me, for instance. I am contingent, meaning that I am the sort of thing that could easily have failed to exist. In fact, at one time I didn’t yet exist, and in the future I will cease existing, that proves I’m not necessary.\\n\\n“So there must have been a cause, maybe my parents, who brought me into existence. Now Avicenna observes that the aggregate whole of all contingent things – in other words the physical universe – is also contingent. After all, everything in the universe is contingent, so taken all together as one thing, it too must be contingent. Thus it also needs an external cause, just like I do.\\n\\n“Since that external cause has to be outside the whole aggregate of contingent things, it cannot itself be contingent. So it is necessary. Hey presto, we’ve proven that there is a necessary existent which causes all other things! And this, of course, is God. I think there is a place for religion in our world. However, we are humans first, a brother/sisterhood, a country, a species and all the way at the bottom of the ladder of relevant quantifiers do we find religion. You want to curse organized religion.  The construct of personal religion ( or god for that matter) helps a lot of people get through life. It’s a framework for them to rest their unrest due to the unexplained. \\nIt’s almost like people never took the science fiction books ( the religious decrees) with a grain of salt.\\nThen somewhere in the history of time, the organizers solidified their positions and it’s been a shitshow since then\\nEdit: I personally don’t give a shit about any god. It’s pretty fucking rational and clear to me. The things which I cannot explain are the gaps in humanity’s ability to understand. Doesn’t mean there’s an invisible god out there Is this a copypasta r/copypasta Fuck athiest too /r/justneckbeardthings Dude chill The big bang started out of nothing by nothing, makes sense U really wrote all of this to promote a subreddit 🤦 Who cares ?

Even with our understanding it doesn\\'t make sense so I like to think theirs a higher power at play, I don\\'t tell people their going to hell or anything like that, I just  like to believe in what I do, i mean if I\\'m wrong it not like anything bad comes of that, religion has started   to make me a better person so it\\'s not all bad r/copypasta material maybe God is real and there’s proof, sorry I can’t just do what you say and believe when there is tons of proof to the contrary. Go back to r/atheism you cheeto dusted edgelord [removed] Ohh wow a cool progressive person bashing the religion, wow claps claps. So what did religion give you ask? Ohh you dont even ask you just bashed it, again super cool but in the spirit of debating it in unbiased(lol does it exist in debates?) manner let me speak against the motion:\\n\\n*  **Meaning to Life/Things**: While in todays world it must be irrelevant to most of us but in the past when reddit did not exist and they did not have u/pking3 to guide them through the mysteries of world ,What gave their life a meaning ? What explained unexplainable world to them? What calmed their curiosities , what prevented them from going madand just live like a hunter gatherer always without any other purpose in their life?  \\n*Downside*: *While it soothed the basic nature of humanity to question things and move forward to other things, it arguably might have might slowed down the development*, but slow and steady wins the race, it was more important that they identify themselves different from animals rather than estabilishing error or noise corrections in the quantum computing and harvesting its quantum entanglement property. Remember how you are first told that sun rises in east in 1st class rather than how the combined result of rotation at tilted axis and revolution of earth around earth gives you days and seasons. I bet you still dont know basic science of why seasons exist, but that is not the point yes sorry.\\n* **Identity:** Next is giving them an identity, it was required to provide more stability to their life. What provided trust among two random beings at that time? *\"Ohh hey bro! I see you are from Meet nagar in Shahdara as well which is thousands of years yet to be, me too, lets grab some beer*\". Trustng each other was the first step towards to give rise to settlements and what promotes trust faster than having same school of thoughts   \\n *\"Hey bro I worship nature\"*  \\n *\"Ahh i see you are a man of culture as well, join in! Loot us later we are yet to have NRC to ascertain your full identity\"*  \\n*Downside: Ohh you understood already, as population grew , clashes grew on whose imaginary friend was better at protecting them while they died more because of him/them.*\\n* **Development:**  While necessity is the mother of inventions, who is the mother of necessities? Yes! The competitions, the wars.   \\n*\"Bro i am oldest religion, we have paper manuscrpits and shiz\"*  \\n*\"But do you have weaponised stones bro?\"*  \\n*\"Bro now we do\"*  \\n*\"But but do you have metals and shiz bro?\"*  \\n*\"Bro now we do\"*  \\n*\"Bro do you have RDX and ammunitions bro? \"*  \\n*\"Bro now we do but bro do you have papers now?\"* ..... Only change is it is no longer for religion but for region now. Religionism gave rise to crusades and we had wars anyways without religion reasons as well. Wars are terrible, but they put science on warp speeds.  \\n*It took 1900 years to find electron in the atom but 50 years to perfect it to ruin the prefectures with Nucleur bomb.*  \\n*Again it took 1900 years to make the first flying thingy and just 10 years afterwards to make it fight worthy in WW1, or 50 years to reach moon.* and many other examples  \\nReligion gave rise to groupism which gave rise to competitions which gave rise to development.   \\n*Downside: No need to repeat*\\n* **Moral Policing/Accountability:** While cinema is witness that no one left someone \"*Bhagwaan ke liye*\". But then what have made masses to conduct themselves in order within themselves? Who did they fear before our hero u/pking3 came here to spread truth. Somewhere in sometime BC  \\n*\"Bro no one pleez steal it behind me\"*  \\n*\"Why bro wathcu guna do\"*  \\n*\"Well I have 24 x7 CCTV surveillance, and i will submit it as proof to Police/CRPF to whoever necessary and they will punish you accordingly\"*  \\n*\"Huh?\"*  \\n*\"I meant God bro, god is all watching and all just\"........*  \\n*Downside: Moral Compass seemed to break during wars with others, this is not a fault of religion though but the followers. No religion asks you to wage war unnecessarily ( i want my comment to stay and not get removed)*\\n* **Teaching How to Live:** Religion gave us a sense of wrongs and rights, dos and donts. While most of it helped,  few are useless in todays world yes. It prevented human beings from going back to uncivilised culture. Spread harmony ( atleast within the religion) . Gave people a space to grow. Defined a set of rules of conduct, became the parent to parentless, teacher to teacherless.   \\n*Downside: Regressive rules, few wrong teachings or wrong interpretations.*\\n\\nThere are more reasons but 5 points suffice.  I tried to stay away from religion while pointing these. I agree there is a lot of hate between people now but then Development/ Science can only come after religion whenever Earth is restarted. Fact that you can rant about it now is beacause it helped you and your civilisation to reach this place in the first. It is not all harmful the same way as Science is not all useful. Make everyone atheist and you will see people forming religion again because until Science explains everything, religion will exist. Religion is not religion it is snyonym of hope and beta \"Ummeed pe Duniya Kayam hai\" Wait til you find out why you\\'re just mad, and there is spirituality out there that isn\\'t toxic. You dont really know what happens after death same as religious people. \\n\\nReligious folks and atheists are two sides of the same coin as far as I\\'m concerned. This kind of cringe ngl Yes, a world full of atheists will be truly perfect... LOL. Humans will be humans regardless of faith. Either do something good for the planet or stand out of the way of people that are. Hinduism is not a religion. Your argument is invalid BTW atheists have their own “religion”... Get a grip dude!

It might give you some encouraging perspectives on life. Please don’t take any impulsive decision. You are strong!! Hi, PM me. \\n\\n\\nMy fiancé said he will find you get a job in his company, if that’s the issue. We could help you out financially if that’s an issue as well. Whatever you need, we’ll help you. I’ve already lost a brother to suicide, I will absolutely not let you do this. \\n\\nPM ME.   We’re here to talk to you. \\n\\n\\nDon’t be dumb. Don’t do this. \\n\\n\\nReach out. I’m here for you. Buddy, you should hone your skills in some other field when you have the free time, even if it doesn\\'t reap any financial benefits. Reading this post, I feel that you should give writing a shot. Just because you do not have the skills to do well in one isolated field does not mean you are useless. It is a very childish reason to feel any sort of guilt. Hope you see things the way they really are. Have a good day. [deleted] This is the state of mind of all non successful IT guys, trust me I have seen few of my useless colleagues getting 2x package jump in new companies and I am still at the same company , it feels bad to see non talented people getting good jobs, but life is that way , just be happy with whatever job you have , just don\\'t compare yourself with the guys getting better pay, compare with those who don\\'t have job at all Hey man. Life is a long marathon. You haven\\'t even completed the first set of laps. It sounds like you have a job but you\\'re not motivated at it but you don\\'t want to quit just yet and try a career change. That\\'s fair. Why don\\'t you throw yourself into learning something relevant to your career? Go back to the basics and re-learn things again. You\\'ll be impressed by how much you\\'ve learnt that you\\'ve put into practice. There are lots of free courses out there.\\n\\nIt also sounds like you are having a difficult time at work. We don\\'t talk about our emotions often in India. Why don\\'t you ask your team lead out for lunch on a weekend or something? Say you have something important to tell them and ask them to meet you outside work. Be honest and tell them about your challenges and your hopes and ask them if they can help you in any way. You would be surprised at how people react to honesty. Frankly, it might make the person relieved because it\\'s much easier working with an existing employee instead of finding a new one and training them from scratch.\\n\\nThe other thing that seems to bother you is the fact that you seem to be the breadwinner. If that\\'s the case then why don\\'t you have a discussion with your Dad and figure out how much the family needs monthly so that you don\\'t stress yourself out by thinking you need a much larger sum than what you actually need?\\n\\nAll in all, it sounds like you\\'re aware of your problems. That\\'s a good sign. Never underestimate the power of self-belief. You just have to do better today than yesterday. Friends are not disappointed in you and they don\\'t want to avoid you. They\\'re just waiting for you to reach out. Hey, yes you! Listen to me dawg there’s nothing in this world that’s not achievable and I mean every word of that sentence. I think it’s right to tell you that I know how you’re feeling and what you’re going through as I was in the similar situation just like this where though of taking my own life also struck my mind. Everyone around me thought that I was an abomination but little as they knew, they’re the same people telling me what a change I made in my life towards a better future. I know what it feels to have no friends or family to talk to. I was an introvert too so making new friends seemed far too unlikely.\\n\\nLet me tell you few changes you need to start making in your lifestyle starting now to achieve the set goal. And remember these are just baby steps which will make you feel good about yourself and think positive.\\n1. Always go to bed before midnight and sleep at least 7-8 hours every single day.\\n2. Wake up, jog for half an hour, get back take a bath and have breakfast.\\n3. Go to work thinking what an amazing day it is and do listen to few melodies on the way.\\n4. Start from basics and learn your way upwards. Never think what your companions might say or do.\\n5. On your way home from work stop at some local market and get some fruits/vegetables for you and your family.\\n6. [MUST] Visit nearby temple of whatever religion you believe in and spend an evening there daily.\\n7. Meet new people, have a little chat about how their day was and tell them about you.\\n8. Get home spend time with your family, have a dinner together if you could, watch some TV.\\n9. Attend social gathering as much as you can.\\n10. Never be alone, be with someone always.\\n11. Don’t drink/smoke/drugs. Never become addicted to something. Try once or twice but don’t let it consume you.\\n12. Stop binge watching TVs and movies, I used to do that a lot and it just ends up wasting much time, Haha.\\n13. Last but not the least, never stay at home in your spare time. Go out wherever you want. Just be outside. Do whatever you want. It helps to cultivate your mind for new possibilities and improvise.\\n\\nGod Bless you! You have an amazing life ahead of you waiting for you to just explored.\\n\\nP.S. If you ever need to talk to someone about anything don’t ever hesitate to message/DM me.  Before you take any steps, please teach out to a counsellor. Just as a last effort. I can understand the stagnation you must feel, but know this a lot of people are in the same boat, including me. I am 36 and as lost as I can be. I dont want to pursue my earlier career path and have been unemployed for depressing long. No idea what I want to do anymore. I know the feeling when at night you think that you were simply not to wake the next day, it would be no loss to anyone, including yourself. Please, please reach out to a counsellor. Man if you change your decision (I think you should) try to understand not everyone is going to win the race somehow my parents taught me this very well and I have learnt to be content of what I have even before I started graduation.\\nYou are just looking for happiness in wrong places.\\nQuit everything go and talk to old monks and use your physical health to help in whatever way you can.\\nWhat is stopping you? You might stay poor for the rest of your life but you will be a \\'Brave poor\\' ending your life is only gonna bring more misery to your name and your parents.\\n\\nIf you really care about them do something with your life.Literally anything trust me deep down all parents just want their children to be a good human being over being rich.\\n\\nTrust me if you are not doesn\\'t mean you are a coward.I agree some people are born intelligent but that doesn\\'t make you a coward.You have to develop the will to fight by yourself.\\n\\nAnd I ll say it again not everyone is destined for being rich and all.If you\\'re not succeeding in your life then you are just going on a path which is not yours. Try and be optimistic my friend. Start changing one thing at a time. Damn. I felt that hard. I\\'m doing medschool and I thought depression was not that big. How utterly wrong I was. \\n\\nAs suggested by many about counselling. Go for it. What you\\'ll get are anti-depressants and good sound advice. That\\'ll make you better.\\n\\nAs for finance, now that you won\\'t be listless enough (anti-depressants and mood stabilisers kick in in about a month) you can start developing new interest in your work.\\n\\nOnce you are out of it, as a 30 y/o, you\\'ll have a lot of experience. Use it to start loving your job. Or finding new one later on. \\n\\nDon\\'t be too hard on yourself. You are educated. You\\'ll do fine. Hi, I\\'m really sorry you\\'re going through all of this. Please please please consider going for counselling/therapy. These are signs of depression. And it\\'s no joke. You\\'re not being pathetic at all. As someone who was once in depression, I partly understand how you might be feeling. But therapy really really helped me.\\n\\nPlease consider going for therapy. DM me if you want to talk. Take care. Just saying these same things to a psychiatrist could help immensely. Right now, the thoughts have overcrowded and want to be let out\\nAlways remember these words \"nothing is permanent but change\"\\n \\nBelieve me, if your head is clear,  the solutions will follow. Maybe you\\'ve neglected your wellbeing until now. That needn\\'t be the case henceforth.\\nLife is learning. And the initial stages are difficult but essential for growth. If you just seek for help, youd be surprised how others are willing to help you. You dont need the whole world to care for you to get out of your rut, you just need a few good ones. \\n\\nPlease seek help for the sake of youself and for the sake of your near and dear ones. A good you, mentally,  emotionally is all they ask of you.\\nEconomic situation will follow. \\n\\nLearn to cultivate a positive mindset.\\nGet a hobby, pastime and spend time on them regularly. And now, you owe it to redditors here too to take care of yourself\\n\\nIts never too late. Dear OP, the company you mentioned do provide some sort of help for people with depression and such thoughts. Even though that company is not the best, this is a really good initiative. Do reach out of those people in your office, talk to them. Help is within your reach sir. And having worked in same company, i have seen people with far less communication and writing skills than you being in top positions. Dont lose heart Mate you need counseling and help with mental illness. Please stop, suicide is not a solution, and I know life feels hopeless.\\n\\nDo you have anyone to talk to? If not then pm me and we can talk.\\n\\nThe first step here is to seek professional counselling. Dm man if you need help. You have some work experience. You were just in a shitty situation. Any choice will be better than suicide. So it\\'s better to talk The biggest privilege is we are alive and have access to unlimited information. Taking breaks is very important life. We think our life bound to our employment and we judge ourselves invariably. The truth is we are all not good at everything that we do,  its supposed to be that way but we are certainly good at something. We need to find what we like. Live our life for ourselves first and nobody else. That is when we will discover what we mean we are much more than the cubicle that we slouch in. Life is much more than a soulless job. Been depressed for about 3 years, On meds and improving. I don\\'t have any elaborate words to teach you about life,but just wanted to say one thing. What your mind is suggesting currently is just a way to get out of all the mess, there are thousand others and maybe better ways. Hang on, it will pass. Hey at least your vocabulary is good. You\\'ll be good at litrature try writing sometime. Nihilist Indian here as well. My mind boggles at the fact that a sizeable population of our country continues to dredge on with their meaningless life.\\n\\nI have seen the people in IT, they\\'re not useful for anything apart from projecting a really bad image of Indian IT. Many of them don\\'t have the aptitude for it, so it\\'s not their fault, I just feel something like the army, or B. Com. followed by the thousands of niche careers (I know a person who\\'s into SCM, and pretty good at it, I can also imagine how shit she would be at something like coding). People mindlessly going into, medical, engineering, MBA and the institutes encouraging them to screw up their entire life for profit.\\n\\nAlcohol and weed numb the pain only temporarily, my mind then again starts asking if the purpose of my life is to build something for a firangi, who can then sell it to another firangi, to get this coupons that I can exchange for a lifestyle that tries to emulate the firangis, but a low quality version of it?\\n\\nI then try to convince myself that there\\'s some redemption in living for my family, but in the end the only thing I\\'m achieving is the continuation of this mindless drudgery. Hey bro...dont do this...please reply...there is 288k people reading your story and worried about you...we can talk and make ur life better... believe me we can..just reply Sounds a lot like me except I have only a handful of months of work experience but that particular part doesn\\'t bother me as I have zero interests or goals let alone the desire to build a career.\\n\\nI hope you stumble upon something joyful to live for before it\\'s too late. Am. In a government job.... Less pay and long working hours.... But i have developed hobbies and all... I read a lot and play basketball everyday... So make new passions if this one doesn\\'t serve you well... Easy to say and all but don\\'t give up.... This will all. One day be a learning for you... Dont give up at all.... This is the best advice I was ever given, so I will pass it on to you:\\n\\nWhich college to attend, whether to buy a car, should you get married or not...for any big decision in life, you should wait at least three days.\\n\\nWhat you seem to be considering is an irreversible decision. There is no going back. Since this is a very big decision in your life, which will also affect all the friends, family and loved ones in your life, you should take at least three days to consider it.\\n\\nI am not giving this advice lightly. I have been in your shoes many times, and this is the advice I take. I know you feel extremely low right now, but that feeling is not permanent. After three days, I assure you this feeling will pass. But you cannot be rash. \\n\\nI also want to explain to you that there is such as thing as brain chemistry. For people like us, certain neurotransmitters may be low. This is not anyone\\'s fault, it is how we are. I strongly advise you to see a psychologist, and also consider seeing a psychiatrist. When you have a stomach ache, you take medicine to heal your stomach. When there is a chemical imbalance in the brain, taking medicine can drastically improve your life.\\n\\nI am not a doctor, so please, go see a psychiatrist (these are people who are therapists but also have medical degrees, they are literally brain doctors) and they will help you deal with this.\\n\\nYou are not alone, and if you need to talk to someone feel free to DM me. Dude, I empathize with you since my life has been eerily similar to yours. I just wanted you to know that you write really well and that\\'s something I wished I was good at. Try to use that skill. \\n\\nPM me if you would like to talk about anything. Please talk to us. Please. \\n\\nWe are all here for you and we all care. If you want to vent and you want someone to listen, PM me. I won\\'t offer advice or sympathy, but I\\'ll listen attentively and empathetically. If you don\\'t want that, tell me how you want us to talk and we\\'ll do things your way, at your pace.\\n\\nI would urge you to seek counselling. It isn\\'t for the weak and the stigma around it is false. As someone who has talked to a lot of people with problems, therapy can and does help.\\n\\nThere is always hope. Promising that things will get better seems disingenuous, because the future is unknown. But, hope remains a constant. And, one more thing remains constant: there are always people who care. You will never trade your place in those people\\'s hearts because your place is permanent and you are irreplaceable to them. Nothing changes that.\\n\\nPlease PM any one of us, myself included. Lay your expectations out and we\\'ll be there for you in the capacity you think you want.\\n\\nEdit: If anyone reading this feels like you don\\'t have a friend you can call at 2AM, I am ex-London Nightline volunteer and am trained in handling suicide/self-harm calls, along with the heaviest of topics. Don\\'t worry about bogging me down. PM me and I will talk. I will try to ensure that your messages reach me. Alternatively, please go to Nightline.org.uk and use their free IM service. Hey there,\\n\\nif you want to talk to someone, you can PM. we can talk it over the phone. \\n\\nI can guarantee you , you are looking at this the wrong way.\\n\\nGive me chance to change your mind. \\n\\nYou got nothing to lose and everything to gain if you just talk to me. Think about parents. Dont leave them alone. Atleast try to live for them. First things first -- SEEK HELP. The kind of thoughts you are describing perfectly fit the clinical definition of depression. I\\'m sorry that you are going through this, man.\\n\\nSecondly, look for opportunities that you can do to keep going for now. Since you\\'re on reddit, I suggest looking into /r/slavelabour and other subs. The flow of money will keep you occupied and give you some financial stability and allow you to access more resources.\\n\\nLastly, connect with people who are/were in a similar situation and made it out. Hope this helps, good luck to you. Please reach out for some counselling, please think positive, lime many have suggested, you have skills you might not even realize are of great value to many. Like you English composition is way above average and something that you can tap into. Some people might say that you have nothing to loose at this juncture then why not take a risk and do something on the business /freelancing front and see how it goes. Have a positive attitude, don\\'t worry about the world, never think people are out to judge you for what you are in life. Being a \"failure\" (your word) doesn\\'t mean you have to give up, the whole world is out there, go do what makes you happy. You just need a good therapist bro. There are better replies here than mine, so i just hope you find peace man. Bye. OP, you need to stop doing this. Go get some basic checks done. Like thyroid etc. Sit down, make a plan, pop a modafinil every few days and go to work like a madman. You\\'ll be better. Maybe you are not meant for computer jobs..is there anything nelse you are passionate about Try to accept pain.It may not make sense but if you’re able to channel your pain you wouldn’t go through like this.Try to think less and work more.The world is an insanely unfair place and I’m sorry that you had such a difficult life.Just do it for your parents maybe but ending it now will not account for the pain you’ve already faced.People will torture your parents and you’ll be branded useless for the remainder of your remembrance...Just for your parents go through this everyone dies at some point naturally or otherwise.Don’t do it because the moment you’re in the middle of dying you’ll regret it but you’ll not be able to undo it. If you look at the grand scheme of things, the universe doesn\\'t really care about who has achieved how much, and who hasn\\'t. We are all just a speck of dust in the cosmos, a blip in the timeline of the universe. So comparing ourself with other so called \"successful\" people is useless.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there are people in this world who are worse off than you. You at least have a job man... You were once smart, intelligent. 100/100 doesn\\'t just happen.\\n\\nI have felt the same way in life, and I know it\\'s a shitty feeling. But that is no reason for just giving up. Once you reach rock bottom, the only direction left for you is up.\\n\\nThink about it this way: Do you really want to be the reason of your parents\\' sadness? Or do you want to start again, and fight your way through?\\n\\nDon\\'t go by the norms of the society - So what if society thinks everyone should have a decent job? Fuck that! Make your own way, make your on goals.\\n\\nCareer is just one small part of your life. I don\\'t know why everyone is so fixated on just making money. Find something that truly brings happiness.\\n\\nDon\\'t be so judgemental on yourself man, you are so young, you can  always start again. Bring back that old you that was cheerful, and smart, and dynamic. I KNOW you can.\\n\\nDM me, we\\'ll talk more. OP don\\'t do it. You\\'re not a failure, no you\\'re absolutely not! My dear friend. When you read this (I sure home you do) know that you don\\'t owe this fucking world and your parents a thing. You are not trapped even if you think you are. You have what it takes the tell the world to fuck off and make your own rules. Do not get bogged down with people\\'s expectations of what it means to be successful. You are the only one who can define and know what makes you happy. Spend time and money on yourself. Think of what you\\'d miss. Pets, your favorite foods, tv series, the ability to travel, see beautiful places and faces \\n\\nI hope you see this friend. Loads of love to you. Is there any way to know if he\\'s fine? Friends are social investments where time is the currency and a little bit of luck is the seed. You will make some and lose some. I am glad you put your thoughts here and people are helping you out. Stay strong. You need to look at the better side of things, life is not just about a job. You will get other job or can do some other things in life. I will suggest you to take total break for few days. Take 2 weeks off from work and go travel and spend time for yourself. \\nMost importantly talk to people you trust and seek professional help. Hey. Seems like we\\'re on the same boat. \\n\\nDM me ASAP. \\n\\nI talked with several people through Reddit having almost Same issues as you. I don\\'t know I can help you or not but please let me try. I also used to and still alone and unemployed. So I think our aloneness can be togetherness. \\n\\nplease don\\'t take any unnecessary steps. If you read this, send me a DM. Let\\'s talk. These feelings are not exclusive to you, many people have them. You need help and support, not an \"end\". I hope you get better. Please don’t take any extreme steps dude. Just read the replies here for once. Life is much more than this. Just talk to us; talk to someone and it will all feel better. People do care about you! PM me, I was in a worse situation than you but have sorted my life out. I\\'m sure I can show you something cool ! OP, listen to this guy. I did not get job for 4 years after engineering in my domain, then changed domain and started from scratch. Never lose hope. OP please don\\'t do it please. It\\'s not as hopeless as it seems to you right now. I\\'ve been there. So glad i didn\\'t do it. So much happened and now it seems so stupid that i ever considered it. The world is huge and there are so many possibilities. Please come and talk. I\\'m here to talk with you, please message me. I am in the exact same situation. Also did my Engineering in Electronics and Instrumentation and my skill set sucks. No friends and nobody who gives a shit about me and I believe I\\'d take the same route as you in the next 4-6 years. I am saving this so I could use this in the future. First of all, you should immediately seek counselling.\\n\\nSecondly, your language skills (not your strength in English, but the way you form statements and put it down) gives me an impression that you\\'re not as dumb as you\\'ve described yourself. In fact, it shows a very well developed mind who knows how to use words and write. I just checked your post history, it shows a couple of posts in /r/WritingPrompts and also in /r/SuicideWatch. I don\\'t know what to make of all of this. If you\\'re not making this up, I repeat you have to seek counselling immediately. I am trying to report this post anyway. Dude, atleast you should\\'ve talked to us once before making up your mind.\\n\\nI hope you\\'re still there.\\n\\nReply to us. We will help you. Talk to your parents man. Just give them a call and  tell them about how you feel. They will surely help you out. Please don\\'t end your life. Its ok to feel these thoughts my friend, Take care of yourself and I hope you don’t do what you intending of doing. This might be the point in your life where things finally turn around. Don\\'t give up!!! OP you could easily pivot your career path in software testing be it Performance testing, API testing ,Selenium Automation testing etc Please think about your family before taking any decision. You going away makes matters worse for your parents.\\n\\nIf not about yourself, think about the driver of the truck the next time when you have such thoughts while on the street. Imagine the guilt he will live with. \\n\\nPlease please talk to someone, anyone of us if you feel alone. Just went through OP\\'s comments and posts. I am so sorry you have been facing these issues for a long time now. Hang in there, everything will be alright! Hey man ! I have been through the same and come out of it too. All I can tell is to stop comparing with others and start pushing your limit . It feels like shit for a couple of years straight (It did for me) but then I improved. I got better and realised a pattern to pushing myself. You too can do it. Don\\'t do it. Just give life a chance. Don\\'t have too many expectations from yourself. The purpose of life is not to be successful or happy. The purpose of life is to observe and experience it. If you can do that, be it by singing a song, reading a book or talking to a person, do it. \\n\\nDo this : If you can, go outside right now, and give 10 rupees to a beggar. If you can\\'t find one, just try to help anyone you can, with any small act possible. Then think about the decision you were making. I’m sorry but don’t do it, there are lots of startup’s looking for different kind of people and not just engineering. I would ask you to take a vacation for yourself and think about all the good things happened in your lives. Stay strong my man. Pls listen to me, this may be a far reach but have you heard of vigyan samagam, search for it, there are 7 mega science projects and out of those 7, at least 6 or maybe all of them need instrumentation engineers who can start afresh. CGPA doesn\\'t matter, they need actual talent which can be applied in those projects. they need people who are fresh, as in who can appreciate the physics and provide the engg skills needed for those projects. Please visit them, apply for jobs there, you may have a chance. I myself am a b.tech student, so I do know what is the placement scenario. Do not give up my mate...\\nEspecially for your parents ....\\n\\nEvery other kid in India has a story exactly like you...infact you might have had a better life as you got placed into a good company...some are still looking for jobs..\\n\\nThe grass is always greener on the other side..\\nSo value what you have..and maybe change your job and get some perspective before deciding anything...\\n\\nI remember a similar post here from some time back...not sure if it was you..\\n\\nTake it easy... Bro please reply I am scared for you. I wish I had the words that will make you feel better right away, but I don\\'t. \\n\\nI know things might seem a little blurry right now but it will get better, just don\\'t give up. \\n\\nIf you think you are out of options, trust me ( and I\\'ve learned the hard way) there are infinite possible options that will make you feel better and motivate you to better yourself. \\nI also know, that you can\\'t think of those options right now, but I don\\'t blame you. I just want to assure you, things can get better. \\n\\n\\n\\nDoes anyone know if he\\'s alright\\nSeriously OP if you are reading this, you need counselling, but  if you can\\'t afford it right now,  don\\'t hesitate to DM me, I am sure I can help you in some way, at least make you feel better. Is it possible to report this incident to some authority so as to check up on him? It’s all self pity and disdain until you see someone in a worse situation pull through and ultimately emerge victorious. If anybody knows op then please let us know why isn\\'t he updating. Or if anyone here had a talk with him then please do let us know. I\\'m worrying for him. Don\\'t do this. Trust me. \\nYou\\'ve forgotten what you have. \\n\\nIf you could not achieve more, learn to live in less.\\n\\nJob is just a small part of life. It can be changed. \\n\\nFind another passion.\\n\\nThere is so much more to be seen. \\n\\nDon\\'t do it. \\n\\nInstead, kill your ego.. Read some philosophy. You will find peace. Trust me, I\\'ve been there. There isn\\'t just one way to earn money. So many things you can do. I believe in you man! You can do great. Just focus on the right things! It\\'s not too late! Find something in life that you like. It can be hobby  or an interest.  Job is to fill your stomach and unless you have interest in it, you will feel depressed and you need something to look forward to.. It will get better. Just talk with someone. Call your parents. Go home for sometime.\\nMaybe being away from family is not for you. [https://www.reddit.com/user/Snoopyrun/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Snoopyrun/)   \\n\\n\\nPlease stay hopeful brother. We love you just the way you are. In the end everything will be okay if not it is not the end. Did anybody hear back from OP?  I hope he is OK. Dude do meditation and start your medication on OCD or go rehab if it helps. Join other jobs like call centre and start small fuck other people who just talk stay connected to people who provide some important info on jobs and creativity. Bring your hobbies into action it helps mentally and try to make money from it. Start trekking get close to nature and others too its good and fast money.\\n\\nLife ko happy rakhna sikh lo bhai Friend, you are not defined by your failures or successes. You can turn all this around, you can be happy -- I promise. Don\\'t give up, I beg you. We\\'re all in this together, and you can look to others for support. \\n\\nPlease don\\'t give up. Are bhai I too feel my education has failed somewhat in logical reasoning. I\\'m starting small with learning pure maths and related books. I suggest you the same, it might be hard to find time but find whatever time and do it. Also.. take the meds. I am probably in a worse situation (in terms of career) than you. I am 28, with family and social situation similar to you. I have been taking exams for government jobs without success. I do not have any job experience. \\nI have been depressed for so long that it feels like a part of me now. I too have suicidal thoughts almost on a daily basis. I can relate to the nihilism and OCD pattern you wrote about. I have no control over my negative thoughts. But, there are times when I feel nothing at all. \\nYou clearly need psychiatric help to deal with it. You should at least watch mental health related videos and talks on YouTube. \\nPlease, just stay strong. Here is a Frank Herbert quote that always helps me - \"The mystery of life isn\\'t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.\" Hope you feel better soon.

The entire education system is based on the Sharma ji ka beta ko 90% mila tereko 89.9999 kyun mila ? system. The rat race is for marks and not for imparting basic education irrespective of the language.  LOL, fuckers really like tampering with education. How about saying to no to learning *vaimanika shastra* and *gomutra yagnas* etc?\\n\\nScience isn't intellectual colonialism.By teaching it in Enlish, you are just ensuring that children are able to hook up on research at a global scale directly rather than be mediated by translators. \\n\\nAlso, fuck your hindi-speaker employment schemes.\\n\\n How about NO.  \\nWe need English and it needs to be promoted further.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \\n\\n ______ \\n**India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology** \\n\\n ______ \\nThere is a major power imbalance in the world, which comes from the language\\nthat dominates the world of discovery, innovation, and science and technology.\\nToday, that language is English. The intellectual domination of the West comes\\nfrom the building of communities whose power comes from their deep connection\\nwith their native language. The language which they use to think, dream and\\nshape the world is their own. This results in ideas that can change the world.\\nIf you do not use or have a mastery over your native language in science and\\ntechnology, then, mere facility makes you a great follower and never a leader.\\n\\nWhile overthrowing political and economic colonialism, we have failed to\\noverthrow intellectual colonialism. In making English the sole language of\\nintellectual discourse in science and technology in India, we have lost on\\nmany fronts. First, exceptions aide, as a community even our best institutions\\ncan never lead globally if English is the only language of high-level\\nintellectual discourse. Our best minds will merely be eloquent paraphrasers of\\nthe ideas of others. Second, we close opportunities in intellectual leadership\\nto huge sections of our population. In other words, as intellectuals we cannot\\nbe the best in the world. In addition to this, we lock the doors to even the\\nsecond- level positions we occupy as elites. One of the many consequences of\\nthis is a poor connection of professional leadership with our society. Thus,\\nwe fail in being great intellectuals, we exclude and do not share a sense of\\npurpose for society. In turn, our society responds to this elitism by\\nundervaluing learning and the intellectual enterprise.\\n\\nThere have been many examples of countries which have successfully addressed\\nthe twin-challenges of developing communities of intellectual leaders in\\nscience and technology and are yet deeply rooted in using their native\\nlanguage for churning ideas. In Germany, science students would have had their\\nprincipal language as German and yet be fluent in English. Many of the best\\nGerman labs are international and the language of discourse may well be in\\nEnglish, yet, the advantage that comes from the ability that German scientists\\nhave to think in their native language, in the most advanced scientific\\nsubjects, is not small. Conversely, no country, including India, that has\\nchosen English as its primary language of scientific discourse, ignoring its\\nlocal languages, has become an intellectual powerhouse.\\n\\nWhenever there is a discussion on this subject, two arguments are made against\\nuniversity education in one’s native language. The first is that English is\\nnecessary in today’s world, which is valid. The answer is not to diminish\\nEnglish, but to enhance the use of one’s native language at every level. The\\nsecond argument is that the task is impossible to implement. This argument is\\nboth a cop-out and false. It is a cop-out because not taking this up forever\\nmakes us an intellectual vassal-state, while maintaining an elite that is both\\ndysfunctional and disinterested. The argument is false because the task is\\nentirely feasible with focus and investment.\\n\\nWhat, then, is to be done? Currently, the bulk of our college education in\\nscience and technology is notionally in English whereas the bulk of our high-\\nschool education is in the local language. Science courses in college are thus\\naccessible largely to the urban population and even when this happens,\\neducation is effectively, neither of quality in English nor communicated as\\ntranslations of quality in the classroom. Starting with the Kendriya\\nVidyalayas and the Nayodya Vidyalayas as test-arenas, we can ensure the\\ntraining of teachers so that students in high-school are simultaneously taught\\nin both their native language and in English. This already happens informally,\\nbut its needs formalisation. The student should be free to take exams in\\neither language or indeed use a free-flowing mix. This approach should be\\nsteadily ramped up and used in all our best educational institutions in\\ncollege and then scaled to be used more widely. Public and private colleges,\\nin STEM subjects, for example, can lead and make bi-lingual professional\\neducation, attractive and economically viable. Technology, can of course\\nassist implementation, but the primary driver is a will to change.\\n\\nOur international partners envy the facility many Indians have with English.\\nWithout losing this, we must also have the ability to think deeply about\\ncomplex and difficult subjects at the level of the best in the world. This can\\ncome only when communities in Rajasthan, Kerala or Odisha can wield, in their\\nminds, their respective languages in the frontier areas of science the way in\\nwhich the French, the Dutch or the Germans do. We should not conflate the use\\nof English as the vehicle for communication and commerce with the use of\\nlanguage as the basis for the power of ideas.\\n\\n**_K VijayRaghavan is secretary, department of biotechnology, ministry of science and technology, and former director of The National Centre for Biological Sciences_**\\n\\n**_The views expressed are personal_**\\n\\n\\n\\n ______ \\n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link. I know & respect Dr Vijayaraghavan immensely, but this is just bollocks. We don't spend sufficiently on education (primary & higher education), what exists is a rat race for 'marks' & not learning, and on top of that, we spend a pittance on research. What little we do has been captured in most institutes by entrenched interests. Let's fix all that and then talk about language.\\n\\nI'm saying that as a supporter for having the first few years of primary education in the mother tongue.\", ' Awesome! I read about this sometime back, but it was speculation and not the conclusion of a study then.\\n\\nAnyone interested in reading viewpoints such as of these researchers should read The Indian Clerk, a book about Ramanujan and his time in England. People are arguing that the Taylor series was proof of invention of calculus. Bitch pls. Be proud if you want to but get your facts right.\\n\\nWhile I understand that the Taylor series is a very important concept in calculus, it isn\\'t necessary to combine the ideas of infinitesimal sums and differences, convergence, divergence and limits to get to it. The form newton and leibnitz fought over inventing was one which had these concepts (as evidenced by newton promptly using it for his kinematics work).\\n\\nSo no, in the true sense, I wouldn\\'t call this the invention of calculus. But it\\'s an absolutely important step there nonetheless... something which neither newton nor leibnitz had set eyes on, so careful before you start accusing them of plagiarizing.  These are REAL Indian achievements. I have no idea why the wingnuts insist on tom-tomming the Taj as a Shiv mandir when there actually are real things to be proud of.  Really, this is new? I thought Madhava and the taylor series has been known for a quite a while now. Newton wasn\\'t even the 1st European to develop the calculus.  A better title would be \"Medieval scientists in Kerala invented Infinite Series centuries before the West\".\\n\\nThis is indeed admirable, but please do remember that calculus isn\\'t just about infinite series, the concept of limits, infinitesimal small changes and their infinite sums is crucial. Infinite series is just one part of the stepping stones to calculus.\\n\\nRegardless, this is definitely something to be proud about. It\\'s interesting to see proper research into the Indian history of the maths, sciences and economics; since this is severely lacking in our narratives of history. However, using clickbaity headlines is a bit disingenuous, but to be expected. It is a 2007 article, going by the date.\\n\\n>\"There were many reasons why the contribution of the Kerala school has not been acknowledged,\" he said. \"A prime reason is neglect of scientific ideas emanating from the Non-European world, a legacy of European colonialism and beyond.\"\\n\\n>However, he concedes there are other factors also in play.\\n\\n>\"There is also little knowledge of the medieval form of the local language of Kerala, Malayalam, in which some of most seminal texts, such as the Yuktibhasa, from much of the documentation of this remarkable mathematics is written,\" he admits.\\n\\nI think Mr Gevarghese George, who sounds like an Indian, has got his primes mixed up. The Brits were rather interested in what we had discovered and what we believed, if the Journal of the Asiatic Society is anything to go by. I would say that the prime reason is what he accepts as \\'other factors\\', something for which the blame lies squarely at our own feet.\\n\\nI think we have done much more than just this - in Advanced Mathematics and Astronomy. And then let it all go to seed ... This is mentioned in Wikipedia. \\n\\n>In the 14th century, Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics stated components of calculus such as the Taylor series and infinite series approximations. However, they were not able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the powerful problem-solving tool we have today\\n\\nThe researcher of this article is George Gheverghese Joseph from Kerala. \\n\\n V INVANTED CALCULUSS [removed] Shocked that I haven\\'t seen a **so prod v invant** comment here so far. \\n\\nAnyway, now that Western scientists have put this matter to rest, I am sure our fellow randians are convinced. Otherwise we would have seen a bunch of disparaging comments about the people who say anything along these lines. Secular feathers will be ruffled. Kya ukhaad liya calculus invent karke Everytime someone comes out with statements like this (especially if they are right), the natural question that arises is - then what the f*** are we doing with our garbage heap of an education system, rote learning, utter absence of creativity, and spectacles like a daytime drama queen (literally) as the person in charge of education, chokehold of bureaucracy, anaemic support for higher education, and research (0.7% vs. 3% of GDP that all of our competitors have)? It must have been invented we had a very skilled and glorious past. Even scientists today r baffled by indian architecture which was created in past. The ashoka pillar is the iron pillar standing in open since years without any rust, and taj mahal ajanta ellora paintings etcetc. But sad truth is today we are a third world country with poverty population explosion and corruption. Just coz ur father was a rich n successfull businessman doesnt mean u keep on doing nothing and encash on his name hope this is clear Not sure, why we always want to compare our civilization with western one. Seems like we still have the inferiority complex because western one ruled over us. \\n\\nWe know  India is one of the oldest and great civilization. A lot of was discovered and invented in India. But can we focus on how what we are today. Even if Calculus was created in India, no one can deny that Leibniz, Newton and western civilization reinvented it, documented it, promoted it, applied it and made it part of math curriculum. \\n\\nSo even if India  created calculus, stop finding reasons for how great we were, and discuss on how can be great today.\\n Calculus is INDIAN^Mlecch_Certified where is the anti kulcha people now Doesn\\'t matter, because Issac Newton was Indian too. He was kidnapped from Yamuna vaidhshalaya (university) and brainwashed by white people. His real name was Isayu Nathuram. Look it up on Subramanian Swamy\\'s facebook page if you don\\'t beleive me. So we inveneted calculus either way. so prod of r kulcha Doesn\\'t matter. Issac Newton (Ishant Nutan) was actually of Indian origin. His father had emigrated from India.  That is why his father forced Ishant to learn Sanskrit which was responsible for Ishant creating Calculus.

For people asking why ISRO is doing this:\\n\\nWe need to explore moon to find if we can set up a base. So that it will be like a pitstop for deep space missions. To escape earths gravity we need more fuel. But moon\\'s gravity is very weak so we can carry more fuel and more cargo.\\n\\nTo set up the base we need to find if we have sufficient water and other essential minerals. Also to check if we can extract rocket fuel, so that we don\\'t have to transport from earth. \\n\\nFor ISRO along with all this, it\\'s the first step in sending Landers and rovers for deep space missions like Mars. Sending rovers and landers to moon is relatively cheap compared to Mars if it fails. So they are doing it step by step.\\n\\nEdit: Thank you kind stranger for my first silver.\\n\\nEdit: Why we need to do Deep Space exploration:\\n\\nBecause we have such a big universe with so much energy and resources. We are fighting for limited energy and resources here, but if we could tap into the energy and resources of the whole universe including our own sun by building a Dyson Sphere, we will have unlimited clean energy. Then all the climate change problem, everything can be solved in an instance. We already have technology to convert carbon dioxide air into solid carbon but we are not doing it everywhere because energy requirement is high.\\n\\nIf you go back in history, the last dominant species of Earth Dinosaur died when an astroid hit, because they were not technologically mature. We have the technology to track astroid, but it\\'s too difficult to find all astroids in the dark space. It may not be the astroid that will end the human species it may be something else, so to change our fate we need to explore to find a new home. For that deep space exploration is important. Also we as a species are explorers that is why we have colonised the whole earth, next step is the solar system (May be Mars and Titan-One of the Jupiter\\'s Moon)\\n\\nIf something were to happen to earth it\\'s impossible to save everyone at least with the current technology, but we can definitely save the human race. Here is the thing about space exploration: if you aren\\'t doing it yourself, down the line you will have to pay exorbitantly to someone who did. It\\'s simple as that.\\n\\nIf isro wasn\\'t doing its thing all this while, we would\\'ve been paying some other countries to launch our satellites and stuffs, military tech and for million other reasons.\\n\\nSo if you are questioning why it\\'s important to explore moon and other places, it\\'s not for you. Maybe it\\'s for the next generation, or the one after that. Or 10 generations from now.\\n\\nDo we owe it to them? Hell yeah! Why? Because whatever shits we are enjoying right now wasn\\'t created in our own generation with our resources, and so onus is on us to be not Dicks and handicap future generations. *Mereko aisa dhak dhak sa horela hai* *Bhai lund kara de, 500₹ extra le lena* Thanks for posting an article from Nature instead of garbage news sites.

I wish everything will come out well as most of the citizens have set their hopes on this mission and their hopes and expectations will do wonders. Fingers crossed. Since I am seeing a lot of negative comments on why we are doing this,  Wouldn\\'t it be better to use this money on education / other things. \\n\\nDude, this is not much money. And education and other things already have budget allowance. We aren\\'t even using that money optimally, so throwing money to other things is not an answer. \\n\\n\\nAlso, what do you want from our high iq scholars? Work in banks or become IAS instead of becoming scientist, or migrate to NASA? Which most of them are already doing. You want to stop brain drain and want those NASA scientists to return to India, but don\\'t want create jobs for them. \\n\\nAlso, our satellite and space data can predict cyclones, weather and other things. Should we shut down isro? \\n\\n\\nWe spend more on Mayawati statues, cricket stadiums and politicians foreign trips then on isro. So the reality is, ISRO budget is not enough, and we need to increase it to support science. \"terrifying\" ???\\n\\nWhy is this word being misused in many chandrayaan articles. Who is being terrified/terrorised and frightened ?\\n\\nIt gives the impression that the scientists are just blindly doing things without confidence, hoping that it touches down. Or Like a student who has not not studied at all & appearing for exams\\n\\nA more suitable word could be challenging, suspense etc.. Astronomy noob here. Please elaborate what\\'s the context of exploring South Pole? Moon\\'s South Pole or Earth\\'s South Pole? All the children in the comments who are arguing whether this mission is needed or not, it\\'s adorable. Fingers crossed. If they lose contact,just tell tapsee pannu to switch the control system on and off once. /s\\n\\nAll the best! A major question in the comment section is how will space exploration help common people or why is space exploration necessary. Here\\'s my two cents\\n\\nSpace exploration is the pinnacle of science and technology. It is the region where we push the frontiers of knowledge, wisdom. Why push stuff you ask? Because pushing is what generates something new. It\\'s about creating a necessity which then causes inventions. Our cameras, computers, batteries, jet fuels, propulsion systems etc all of them are direct beneficiaries of space exploration. Satellites are behind internet, TV, GPS, cellular network. Not even one of those is dispensable.\\n\\nParker probe (the one sent to sun) necessitated the invention of materials that could withstand huge thermal loads. Mars rover would eventually result in more efficient helicopters. Coming to this particular mission, the landing site is unexplored. ANY finding there is going to result in better understanding of our universe.\\n\\nSpeaking of purely monetary terms, ISRO launches satellites of other nations which brings profits. The reliability to price ratio of ISRO is very high which brings many customers.\\n\\nTake out all of this. Space exploration provides employment.  The money spent on a rocket is not going to waste, it is going back into economy and coming back to the government too in the name of taxes. \\n\\nIf you can think of ANY other field that could provide inspiration and employment to millions, better our understanding of universe, push for a better technology, be my guest. You know it\\'s scientifically important af if Nature is covering it. Full power to the mission control team and everyone involved. This has been a wonderful project that has really put is out there as one of the stronger nations when it comes to space exploration. Hope it all works out well and we are able to execute all that has been planned for the mission. Godspeed and Jai Hind! It carries the hopes of more than 1.3 billion people. I hope it\\'s a success [for interested people](https://imdb.com/title/tt1772240/). It involves lunar south pole. On 7th September, India will be the first nation to land a machine and study the south pole on Moon. Moon is the 1st step for the interplanetary human civilization of the near future. 1st Moon, then Mars and the NEO asteroids, then the belt - it will unlock unimaginable wealth for mankind. The cost of space exploration is going down with advanced technology. Hopefully, in the near future we would be able to remove our polluting industries and mining to space to make the earth and the ocean pristine again. Best of luck ISRO. Asking out of curiosity, why doesn\\'t India has a ISS lab / module ? Why is it suddenly \"If touchdown is successful\"? Have we lost faith in ISRO already? Let\\'s not be so pessimistic. Hope for the success! Veery very true that Indians are unique and doing awesome things with this unique ness The opening words are  \"countless setbacks and delays\". Not sure if that is entirely true. I really never understood the purpose of such mission.\\n\\nI mean why they want to  explore moon, for water and minerals ? But why ...isn\\'t earth is enough for discovering that. \\n\\nWhy we need water on moon, we can\\'t civilise million of people like earth ,and even if we find minerals what can we do with it. Like mining them.  ? Is that easy.. economical. It\\'s extremely difficult and I don\\'t think it\\'s economical too\\n\\nPeople want to occupy Mars, i never understood why we need Mars. \\n\\nWe have on earth sufficient minerals and forests , we just failed to properly exploit it without affecting environment.\\n\\nMillions of people are dying of hunger and many diseases, education has pathetic standards.\\n\\nFor me it\\'s just a show off thing , so that we can show off to rich nation that we also can do same. But we failed to understand Europe USA Japan China are far more developed than India, it\\'s like hobby for them to explore moon Mars Saturn with extra pile of cash.\\n\\nWe have far more important problems than mere spending money on useless mission, it\\'s okay we do such mission when we get developed fairly well then it makes sense \\n\\n\\nHealth, environment pollution, disaster management , sustainable energy are to be focused more and we need more research on these issues. \\n\\nWe are spending millions of dollars on finding water on moon , while millions of people don\\'t get water on earth.\\n\\nThanks for downvotes  😇 #sillymilestone Can we navigate this unmanned object to the location of the US Flag and debunk the Moon conspiracy once and for all? Please? So, India is going to explore the South pole of the moon.  I bet they find a bunch of dirt, rock, no trees, no grass, no life.

We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called \"Congress + Cow\" it has been jokingly called \"Prakash Karat + Cow\". Such is the success of Modi\\'s socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.\\n\\nWhat exactly are these policies? Real problem is fake news. Most people aren\\'t smart enough to check facts by themselves. I think for a long time in this country, there was a belief that the 15% Muslims have a veto on who rules India in BJP circles. I think there is a quote by Balbir Punj, former BJP MP saying the same. \\n\\nThe thing is that although as you say 85% of Indian Muslims are backward classes, the whole community itself was almost a single monolith when it came to voting preferences. \\n\\nComing to some specific parties, say Mulayam Singh. As the family becomes powerful, it looses focus and becomes a Yadav party and all other OBCs leave. Same for Mayawati. As she becomes all powerful, Jatavs become powerful. All others leave. \\n\\nBJP, has in fact given tickets to the non Yadav OBCs and non Jatav Dalits in a significant number. What BJP has done at the same time is create the most loyal caste base India has seen: Upper caste Hindus. They will vote BJP because they are scared of everyone else. \\n\\nThe opposition is not without blame for this. When you constantly 24/7 call BJP a Hindu party screaming at the top of your lungs, you are literally begging the Hindus to vote BJP.\\n\\nConclusion: I don’t think the caste politics is dying. It’s just that it’s been played in a different way which seems more efficient. \\n\\nP.S.  this is just a discussion. Do not take anything too seriously I don\\'t agree with the \"government uplifting backward classes and hence getting the votes\" part. Most of the policies, as already mentioned by others, predate this government. Furthermore, most of them are either pure disaster(DeMo), mismanaged policies with potential(GST), or did very little compared to how hyped up they were(swaccha bharat, ujjawala). MNREGA, beti bachao beti padao and the likes existed even in UPA era, and were better funded than now.\\n\\nPoverty literally increased under modi, so did unemployment, and income inequality. I should remind you that UPA under Manmohan uplifted record number of people after poverty in a decade, a record only second to china, farmers too, which constitute most of the backward people in India did far better under Manmohan. \\n\\nWhat\\'s getting them vote is organised hatred they spread online. Indian people are gullible, and BJP were quick to capitalise on that. People don\\'t question the policies because they don\\'t see the government as the problem, the media and the IT cell have given people other enemies to blame in trying times- Muslims, Congress and Pakistan. \\n\\nI should add, if you think upper castes think any better of the backward ones now, you\\'re wrong. Nobody\\'s enlightened, they just have a bigger enemy for now.  If hypothetically, muslims were removed, the caste system will reach it\\'s former glory in no time. Pleasantly surprised to see a post like this identifying that a majority of Muslims are indeed erstwhile so called lower caste pedigree. \\n\\nGoes to strengthen my view that there aren’t really religions in India but castes, castes and castes. \\n\\nThat out of the way, the lower castes are - by design - kept under educated and under represented that very few realise they’re being used. Example: https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/books/book-review-i-could-not-be-hindu-the-story-of-a-dalit-in-the-rss-by-bhanwar-meghwanshi/cid/1765671\\n\\nIn Karnataka, for example, many towns have a colony called a “A K colony”. The A K denotes a caste and as opposed to an “agrahaara” which are usually a Brahmin stronghold, the AK colonies are typically a stronghold of a particular low caste often reflecting the gross neglect over time as well. \\n\\nThese places - and others like it - have always had high unemployment. All of this is a complete package you know. It’s extremely hard to get out of. Anyway, in these places the testosterone fuelled unemployed youth are usually up to no good. Given no support system and discrimination outside and all. Back then they were used by the powerful as henchmen or for other dirty work. Now they’re still used by the powerful but the new powerful are all consolidating under the Hindutva label. \\n\\nThe caste system is so uniquely ubiquitous in everyday life that the privileged bubble inhabitants can’t even begin to fathom the “world building” that invoked if it all were presented as a novel.\\n\\nThere are some unique castes - typically the erstwhile landowner class. Who’ve since graduated to owning large institutions, businesses and so on. You know, grown up, productive stuff. I have so much awe for how they look after their own and the sort of support system they’ve developed for themselves which allows even for the “underperformer” amongst them to achieve something in life that he or she may feel proud of.\\n\\nThis almost never happens in the case of a lower caste disadvantaged person. The rare ones who do happen to break out of it - if they were lucky enough to get some sort of support in the form of reservations _and_ familial, financial support and have the fortitude to survive the education system without being discriminated against. They still face an uphill struggle wherever they end up working at. More so if it’s a government workplace. \\n\\nIf they excel and do better than their peers they’re subject to allegations of having cheated and get corruption cases filed against them. And after having to face all of this shit in their career are left with little to no wherewithal to be what they wish they had when they were young - a mentor, godfather or a role model to their own “kind”. Just like in the other powerful castes, ahem, “communities”. \\n\\nAnd that’s where the current _shaaka_s are capitalising on. Catching them young. Keeping them dumb. Not letting them rise. Making them hate each other and the Muslims who’re no different than they are. Driving away the “missionaries” who come with an education package. \\n\\nA core feature of a hierarchy is that it is designed to always make anyone who’s not at the very top nor at the very bottom to have someone to feel superior to. And those at the lower ladders are at a double whammy position where they’re not enlightened enough to realise the harm they’re doing unto themselves by being part of some of the heinous crimes you hear of in places like TN.\\n\\nAnyway, it’s a shit show. I’m envious that a majority of the caste denying elitists here don’t have to see or imagine any of this and live their grand privileged lives envying that one SC guy who drove a BMW. \\n\\nNo political party every stands for them. KA has had exceptional leaders from such castes for decades and they’re _never_ allowed to rise up. It’s by design. Nobody can break out of it. Your analysis is quite correct , and the reason Islamophobia is growing because many lower caste ar getting educated and thanks to propaganda they are likely to see Islam more of a threat compared to Brahminism.\\n\\n A small example of how Manusmriti ideology has even engulfed Dalits.\\n\\nI happened to meet One of my batchmate who used to be a torched bearer of Ambedkarism in our university ( we both are Dalits).\\nI was shocked to see idols of gods and the blatant karmkand things in his house which he used to vehemently oppose.\\n\\nI just asked him that what happened to you in all this year\\'s .\\n\\nHis reply was \\' Ye Buddhism Jai bhim wagerah mein maaza nahi hain , kya milta hai Buddhist banke ,enjoyement apne hindu religion mein hi hain, I got so many things when I started following hindu religion. Jai bhim banenege toh koi bhi festival nahi hain. ,Kya matlab uska.\\n\\nI just told him that your job, degree is only because several decades back a man fought for it with the establishment ,if not for him you would be  sewering in a gutter and doing what you are supposed to do.\\n\\nMany backward castes which have become affluent due to capitalism post 1990s are more hindus and more casteist than the Brahmins , like Yadav\\'s , Gujjars, Marathas who are more indulged in caste based atrocities compared to the Brahmins . I think you make valid points regarding (a) why BJP has gained the reserved seats; and (b) caste politics has been overshadowed by the unifying hatred against the Muslims.\\n\\nWe all probably agree with u/Android5511 that the reason for (b) is not so much the effective implementation of welfare schemes but the successful deployment of polarising techniques by BJP and its media cohorts. That said I find their optimism that Modi-lahar might wane slightly misplaced for three reasons: (i) there is no indication that these polarising techniques have lost their efficiency; (ii) as the present pandemic has given the Center sweeping powers, regular administrative functions and even botched operations are now going to be touted as Modi\\'s achievements; and (iii) the voting behaviour in state elections can be the opposite in central elections, case in point Jharkhand which they refer to.\\n\\nAnother shortcoming which I find in the print commentariat as they try to understand why Dalits vote for BJP is the shallowness of their analyses. Best exemplified by Dilip Mondal\\'s article that you linked, they fail to answer why is it that Dalit voters, especially in urban areas, don\\'t rally behind radical Dalit leaders. It would require a much lengthier write-up, but I suspect that it is the lure of savarna ethic and the success of capitalism which they are led into believing, owing to the constant media propaganda and the ineptitude of parliamentary Left in India. Please note that I am not saying the savarna ethic is worth emulating or that capitalism is actually successful, quite the opposite I would say. But such is the hegemonising power that the cultural elite have, a point noted by Gramsci and successive others.\\n\\nThe savarna ethic is a self-replicating one, a virus. One can see that many OBCs and many Dalits become strident defenders of Brahmanism once they acquire a certain degree of social mobility. Led into thinking that their emancipation is because of the savarna ethic, and not despite of it, many try to abnegate their Dalit identity itself. The same can be said about capitalism; it is the lure of this heady cocktail of Baniya capitalism that fuels India and shapes Dalit politics (outside the safe spaces of universities) today. \\n\\nIn such a context, it is difficult for a Bahujan combine to have any real political teeth, though not impossible. To begin with, such a possibility requires a theoretical agreement between the political actors.', ' Our society thrives on abuse of power. We let too many idiots and abusers propagate their views with no societal checks.\\n\\n\\nif you are polite and calm,people will say \"yeh tho chutiya hai\" and fuck about. I asked a university functionary (leading private university in Manipal, Udupi - should be obvious now)  for a laptop that was part of the tuition fees, two months after my programme started. Got a lot of flack for speaking up. We\\'re being systematically trained to closet our thoughts. Will never happen because this atmosphere rarely changes at home. That is where this habit is learned and festered. Your default Indian cultural teaching is: Respect your elders (The no matter what is left unsaid) That really bad, if i was shouted at by my manager i should think how bad it feels and shouldn’t do it when i become manger , i dont know why people become their manager who starts shouting at other just cz they were shouted at.\\n\\nI have been a team lead and a Manager, i can honesty say i have always i have treated  my teammates how i wanted be treated by my seniors and always supported them. \\n\\nAnd employees are not slaves , you only pay them for the work they do for you and u dont own them . \\n\\nI have seen a guy who was acting manager who was shouting at in his friends company , complaining about being shouted at by his manager  where he actually worked for salary . The hypocrisy that\\'s indeed the case most of the times.\\n\\na lot of \"millennials\" and younger folk do indeed treat folks younger than us, folks in retail jobs & traditionally \"low profile\" jobs (like Security, Maids, Janitorial staff) with more respect than our parents did.  \\n\\nthere\\'s always the odd argument & disagreement - but it\\'s rarely based on \"class\" and \"status\".\\n\\nMost of the folks who are bosses, reporting managers & senior staff do consider work life balance, mental health & many such factors as well.\\n\\nhopefully the trend continues & we do indeed evolve to a better social atmosphere than one, from the years gone by. Never understood the ragging culture. No matter how small or insignificant the task is, it is not required to develop camaraderie. I\\'ve never been a part of it, and will never be a part of it. \\nIf I want to get the juniors to feel at home, I\\'ll invite them to a DnD session or some pubg/csgo and chill. Why does this ragging bullshit happen in this country. Bastards who studied at the institution for extra years think they have some sort of authority over others. The notion of a \"pecking order\" is deeply ingrained in our culture:  \\n\\n- The upper-caste is higher up the pecking order than the lower caste  \\n- Husband is higher up the pecking order than wife  \\n- Boy children are higher up the pecking order than girl children  \\n- Seniors (in office, in college, in cricket team) are higher up than juniors  \\n- etc.  \\n\\nThe person who is higher up is to be \"respected\", and the person who is lower down should expect to be yelled at and ill-treated.\\n\\nI believe that this is one of the major things about our cultural mindset that makes us fail to achieve our potential. The Indians who flee the country and achieve good things abroad (Nobel laureates, global CEOs) are the ones who are able to break free of this. This is SO needed in our society.\\nI went to a medical school, in case you do not know the way seniors treat juniors at medical or dental Institutions is horrifying. To make matters worse, professors are aware of all the activities that happen around. You were asked to complete assignments of seniors, run errands for them, entertain them, some girls would give in and date seniors to avoid being ragged & humiliated by others ( if you date a senior, it’s basically like a shield). My friends and I would avoid cafeterias and libraries so as to not run into anybody. You have to address every senior by sir or ma’am and wish them good morning or good evening each time you see them in the hallways. There were repercussions if not followed.\\n\\nAnyway, when we got to the second year we were so done with being treated like shit by our seniors. We decided to break the chain. Outta 100 from our class around 20 people were in and we did. By the time we graduated, ragging had diminished as new batches came in and it was reported to us seniors if at all anyone attempted anything. The juniors were no longer treated like slaves and people were genuinely helping each other out. There was no fear and juniors could actually hang out at the common areas.\\n\\nBut it wasn’t all roses, we were highly criticised and also humiliated by our own batch mates, seniors and professors for being responsible for the lack of “discipline” (intimidation) in the institution. We were told ragging and fear of seniors makes one respect them and it would give them a firm hand and authority till they graduate. I always hated being made to work late night or attend late evening calls.\\n\\nSo when I became a manager - no more meetings or calls after 6pm, and any work left after 6pm is deferred to next day.\\n\\nMy team is the worst performing team in the company apparently according to some qualitative parameters that My boss (director of firm) has in mind.\\n\\nMy team gets least of bonuses, and slowest promotions, but at least we live a good 9-6 life. Woohoo!!! I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY... This is so true. And it\\'s necessary to remember to be like this no matter what you face from others.\\n\\nI\\'m a lead of a design team in an MNC. We have multiple issues where someone in marketing makes unreasonable deadlines to their superiors and expect everyone else to take the burden of their mismanagement. I\\'m very confident about my team, they\\'re highly qualified. I often tell our marketing teams to not rely on making my team work overtime to fulfill their demands.\\n\\nMy colleagues often tell me it\\'s my fault for not yelling at my team to meet demands I get, but as you\\'ve mentioned, the cycle has to break. [this picture captures what you are saying!] (https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*Ji2NOADihSoMqZIEzbbs0g.jpeg) A lot of people in this thread have already told you that this will never happen.\\n\\nOnce, I had to go to the US embassy in Vancouver, B.C. to get a visa. The passport photo I\\'d brought with me was deemed to not be recent enough, and I had to get in line at the embassy\\'s photo booth. In front of me was an Indian family — a mother, a father, and a kid who was about four. They were taking their time at the booth, which I didn\\'t mind at all since I was busy doing a crossword. In the midst of their struggles with the booth software, the child started to squirm out of the grip of his father, and his father responded by telling him that he was going to get slapped (in Hindi).\\n\\nTo tell you the truth, I was pretty shocked. It\\'d already been a long time since I\\'d heard such a crude threat of violence to enforce compliance, but then it all came back to me — \"this is just how Indian people are,\" I thought — though of course I\\'m Indian myself. I\\'d lived in the US for so long I\\'d forgotten that violence, ego-slinging, and negligent laziness are among the only problem-solving methods most Indians are equipped with. You only have to look at the recent lockdown policing stints to find proof.\\n\\nLuckily, I\\'ve managed to break this cycle for myself by going through a personal hell and coming out a better person on the other side. I believe that that is the ONLY way for people to truly change, if they go through _severe_ trauma due to their faults. As if that wasn\\'t enough, I think it\\'s important to be far from the environment that nurtured those personal faults in the first place.\\n\\nIt\\'s too much to ask this of an entire population of billions. Celebrating aggressive behaviour is also one reason for increased toxicity. When we consider an aggressive person as a hero everyone wants to be heros thus extending the chain. Here is a reason why speaking politely, atleast for now, will not get things done in India.\\n\\nI was applying for exemption from articleship from a professional institution in India (CA/CS/ICWA). I followed the procedure, submitted the documents, called them up and told them. And also followed up by email. Nothing. Then I wrote an email to the director citing delay. I got a call from the office and the lady started blaming me that i am student and should behave myself. I am from Mumbai. She was from Delhi/UP (not sure from the tone). I spoke in the language that we use on the streets including expletives and threats. \\n\\nMy exemption was approved without any hassles in less than 48 hours after i yelled at her. No adverse impact later.\\n\\nIndia doesn\\'t have a good work culture. The so called work culture (at least in structure and productivity mapping) we see in software companies is because of the forced discipline from international companies. On our own, we basically do whatever we want and call it procedure. We are supposed to love our company because \"in India, employers usually dont fire us\". Except for Tata Steel (not TCS), i know of no such company.\\n\\nEven in MNCs, i remember a tamil manager, who had an unstated heirarchy of hiring - First Tamilians, if no tamilian available, then anyone from south india. If anyone not from South India made it (because he didnt have entire control) he wasn\\'t rude or bad. He just made sure all the plum positions, opportunities, meetings, rewards went to his tamil buddies. How I know this? I am from south India and he hired me thinking that I also belong to his school of thought. Shortly after, I gave him a piece of my mind and his response was basically along the lines of *\\'elders must be respected\\'* As a default we consider all humans good people.  This is the way it is suppose to be, however in reality this notion gets defeated. I agree to a small extent that venting of frustration may come as across pent up anger and follows a cyclical pattern, however this is not always the case. There is an inherent ISSUE with us, we have air of superiority and this comes to us naturally because of our socio- economic development and the experiences we face. To a lot of extent upbringing and family atmosphere matters. Though is nice to assume all people are good and will do their bit to break the chain, changing ones attitudes is extremely difficult, i will go further and say not possible. We need to work on improving the outlook from childhood, superiority should be replaced with solidarity and empathy. At the same time, I would stress on the need of having stronger, accessible laws and provision to use for the people who face such abuse. This for me is the first and foremost thing to be done. More than often people dont speak up cause of fear and feel the system is skewed towards the victim. While it is nice to give a second change to the lets call him/her \"abuser\", the first incident shouldn\\'t be neglected albeit a private office setting or the maid. In fact a comparison between the maid and what happens in a office is not correct. In office its an open setting, with certain corporate provisions to call out these incidents if they get out of hand. For a non unionised maid.. if part of her life to face the brunt of people who by luck of birth were born in a different family. Though as adults we need to take the responsibility of civil, just, non abusive behaviour the rules and provisions need to be strengthened to nip this behaviour at the bud in official or domestic setting. As a social change we need to teach children at home equality and empathy trumps superiority. The ripple effect should mirrored in schools and society at large. Any solution for the junior in this position whose manager is doing the same? Upvotes from me Let me just add as someone who lead 3 different teams at a company. Don\\'t hold back to stupidity. If someone is slacking around the clock for months and pretends like they are the best I don\\'t want them handheld. I want them either fired or lectured.\\n\\nI was nice to all the guys who did their duties (we still grab drinks/coffee together 5 years after I left) but there were people around for years above and below me who didn\\'t do anything and made it a habit to ruin my weekends and found ways to make me work overtime by passing the ball, at a certain point I snapped and gave them each a earful. It\\'s also what lead me to leaving the company since their ass licking ensured they were safe for life. some a$%holes downvoted this too. You basically summed up Netflix\\'s The Platform.\\nI\\'m all for what you said, but people aren\\'t all the same. Start questioning your dad.\\n\\nAll of what you explained are examples of toxic authority. Authority will get toxic if it\\'s unquestioned. It\\'s human nature.\\n\\nQuestioning authority is the foundation of democracy. It has to be encouraged and it starts at home.\\n\\nAge doesn\\'t command respect at all. Behaviour does and there\\'s a basic threshold you extend to everyone before you can observe their behaviour.\\n\\nWhen you say respect your elders, what you\\'re really saying is that threshold is different for older folks.\\n\\nThey can and do get away with shitty/toxic behaviour more often. This is what this post is all about.\\n\\ninb4 someone says I\\'m promoting anarchy. Questioning authority is not removal of authority. That’s the human condition I once brought this up on here and people excused it saying you cannot survive without following this work structure. I mean who asked them. As some others in this thread alluded to, it\\'s not just Indians, many humans in general simply haven\\'t  fully \"evolved\" yet...\\n\\nRelated: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedovshchina\\n\\nDon\\'t look up the videos, really horrifying. After reading this, I realized this was partly why my dad was probably abusive at home sometimes when I was a kid. His work environment was toxic if I remember correctly with a dictatorial and abusive person in charge from whom there was no escape for anyone. Thanks for starting this thread OP. I left the country and have spent the last two decade away from my family to escape it all. Hopefully, people will take heed and change.', ' Our country is just too far in at the moment and there\\'s no turning back now, our best hope is to believe that we make it to the other side without taking too much damage.\\n\\nSomething much worse than the 2002 riots is ahead of us, it always was but now with the Covid-19 situation acting as a catalyst we are going to reach there sooner. A couple of points\\n\\n1. I think India is inherently fragile. BJP has not invented something, they are just leveraging the pre existing fault lines. Another thing is that there are so many people who vote for BJP because they are so fed up with the opposition. \\n\\nI don’t know exactly but Rahul Gandhi wouldn’t get a lot of crowd in my tiny village. \\n\\n2. A substantial part of this country do not care about democracy. People don’t like having to make difficult decisions.\\n\\nDon’t consider this as a debate to your points, just my PoV. BJP stands for divisive politics. In a state where the minority is a majority they play the outsider insider politics. A place where the majority is the majority the play the caste wala card. BJP is being run like an efficient political business so i don\\'t see when and how it can be stopped. If you kill in the name of religion, your God has already forsaken you.           \\n- Unknown Though I appreciate what you are saying, Majority of the people are just too naive and uneducated to understand what you are saying.\\nLack of Education and awareness is the root cause of divisive politics based off of religion. Your actions show your real motives, not your words. going by your logic, there is no real reason Muslim women should vote for congress as they were the ones opposing triple talaq and it was bjp who made it into law In the US, you say \"Chinese Virus\" and people will call your a racist. \\n\\nIn India, you say \"Corona Jihad\" you\\'re a nationalist. \\n\\nAnd people say India will soon become a superpower. My ass. If you pay attention, India is becoming the next Pakistan. The only Job of a political party is to stay in power no matter what they have to do for it.\\nI don\\'t think BJP is at fault, the people of India are at fault. Fuck BJP. Fuck Religious people. Dalits dream of becoming a mainstream Hindu someday where they are treated equally, so they will do what they are told. They forget that they will never be accepted as equal. They are in for a rude awakening >  and why are dalits even supporting BJP\\'s assholes\\n\\nBecause they don\\'t understand how Hinduism promotes Brahminical supremacism, which implies oppression of people like them. That\\'s why they are, and their ancestors before them were, and their descendants will be, dalits!\\n\\nYou can\\'t expect everyone to be as woke as Ambedkar who understood how Hinduism is oppressive to Hindu lower castes. The same people conveniently ignore the numerous Hindu Festivals The reason dalits support bjp is because the rss recruit them at a very young age. Rss targets the vulnerable as in the poor. The poor mostly consists of sc/st. And as such the rss sink their claws into them at a very young age. They\\'re brainwashed by the age they can make decisions on their own they are set in their own ways. This isn\\'t the case for all sc/st some do luckily get away.\\n\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/51h4_wL4Ah0 [removed] Absolutely agreed India is an authoritarian state bro lol [removed] > still are doing by staying hidden\\n\\nJust to clarify they are not hidden but stranded just like many people during the tirupati or the ones stuck in Ahmedabad for which a special bus was arranged by tadipaar to send them to uttrakhand Are you Muslim OP?', ' This looks like an IIPM ad 1.

Also, the chances of her making calculated and logical decisions for the benefit of people is really high. Hope she improves her marketing though.

It is a lost cause.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/flmmps/man_riding_motorcycle_beaten_up_in_maharashtras/) I am in two minds about this.\\n\\nI do feel that we shouldn\\'t in general dehumanize people. It *seems* grossly unfair. The wars and games between our ruling classes shouldn\\'t destroy our humanity as individuals.\\n\\nBut there\\'s also this angle: the members of a tribe (religion, nation, race, caste, ethnicity, etc.) need to be aware that the tribe\\'s harmful actions towards others will exact a toll on them individually. For instance, if members of caste A are especially casteist and/or communal, then individuals from that group should feel the heat for it from others, even if the individual himself or herself may not be casteist or communal. Otherwise they will have that much less incentive \"fix\" their tribespeople.\\n\\nI have used this principle with respect to myself. If I am hated because members of my \"tribe\" exhibit certain undesirable behaviors, then while I may not \"deserve\" it, I certainly should realize that the reaction is expected, natural, and even healthy, in a way. It gives me an incentive to fix the harmful actions of my fellow tribespeople. Hating or punishing the members for the transgressions of their tribe is a normal strategy used in tribal calculus. It may not be healthy individually or collectively to suppress this ancient instinct. Just like our instincts for revenge and sexual jealousy, it might exist for a reason. r/ABCDesis If the government allow us :). > and that no one was coming for him.\\n\\nha he\\'d most likely be better off staying in China Is that what they call trying Humanism? Brother you are preaching to the wrong crowd. You need to post this to other hateful subs. >\\tI mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen. \\n\\nThe problem with these things is that they\\'re usually expected to only go one way. It\\'s only Indians who are expected to bend over backwards and consider humanity and finer human values, Pakistanis are never expected to return the gesture. \\n\\nSupport for fellow men would also require the Pakistanis to stop sponsoring the terrorists who kill Indian civilians. At this point terrorists have killed more Indians than covid-19 has (though I expect that equation may change in a few weeks) and yet Pakistan continues to actively support terrorists.\\n\\nThings have gotten to a point where despite being on the FATF grey list, which hurts their economy, they continue to support it. They\\'re willing to let their country burn if it means Indians will die. When you have that kind of hatred emanating from that side, you can expect it to be reciprocated.\\n\\nFWIW, I\\'d prefer for India to evacuate all students as long as the logistics allow it. What do we do after that though is an open question. Will Pakistan take back these students or simply dump them on India to treat/quarantine? Remember this is a nation that refused to accept the bodies of its own army men during Kargil, and the army is basically the organization that runs the country. It\\'s still morally the better option and so we should have done it, but let\\'s not bring in all these ideas of support for fellow men which only ever go one way.

The reason for this is that the riots were started by men brought in from UP.

The most he could have done is some noise. AAP has 62 MLAs.\\nWe know the police are not under their control, but all of those 62 have got at least 10 security guards.\\nIf they all would have gone together with their protection force on the day of events, at least those 620 would have protected few lives. Assuming the police guards feel ashamed in front of the minister to act.\\n\\nBut all of those 62 chose to sit and enjoy Twitter. Mob of both the sides was out their in numbers..its was communal frenzy. What can AAP will do. If riots continued for 3 days in a national capital means police stand downed. Lets be honest kapil mishra is not a big leader to go this far unless he had the blessings of amit shah. More and more anti CAA protests are taking place and riots is to instill fear in em that\\'s why all that happened and police dont have the orders to stop it What has happened is that BJP, by crying about identity politics the loudest, has made sure all other parties are now shy to be seen as engaging in identity politics. In this way they have made sure that all parties have ceded ground to them and they can now play identity politics themselves to their heart\\'s content. If a party can win 54% of the votes in a city, it has the political capital to intervene. Who knows, maybe a big supporter backed intervention and a \"call for peace\" movement could have become a launchpad for kejri on the national scene again. One possibility is that AAP was not prepared how to handle this. They have learnt to suppress their natural instincts and now they do things while keeping the brand imagery in mind. Due to that, they couldn\\'t decide in time on what their next step should be branding wise and by then the ship had already sailed. [deleted]', ' Except Indira all of them loved dissent.

It will take time for him to build credibility at national level and hopefully he gets better with time. I dont live in Delhi but hear from my friends stories of good governance by him. As for freebies, socialist programs from a surplus government don't hurt anyone and are good for everyone in long run. Telling from personal experience. /r/enlightenedcentrism, but unironically. AAP is the same, Kejriwal has grown\\n\\nHe isn't the same idiot who complained 24 hrs about BJP and Modi\\n\\nThat's what they should do. Keep up the good work and not fall in the traps of Hindutva. I am sure AAP will and should return to run Delhi going forward. I honestly have faced no difference but whenever I interact with maids, security guards, Uber drivers, etc., it feels like their welfare schemes have genuinely helped them. I don't think I am in any position to criticise any of them.\\n\\nAAP has surely improved the quality of education in Government schools bringing in better infrastructure, more engaging parent interactions, etc.\\n\\nThey should not align with INC, BJP, BSP, SP, etc., because all these parties have had a history, at some point or the other, of corruption. It will take years for AAP to gain the footing of even SP or BSP but I don't see that as a bad thing. And support the abrogation of Article-370 and abolishing the statehood of Kashmir while demanding the same for Delhi. Nice touch AAP please bring French secularism to India. i love kejriwal ❤️ I don't think Kejriwal's ideology is issue for any voter. It will take some skills and a control on ego to spread beyond Delhi. Till now AAP hasn't managed to build presence in any other metro which would happily accept his brand of politics. They are literally just Congress that can implement schemes.\\n\\nThey pander to the times with no real ideology. It works as long as you keep delivering.\\n\\nThey are center right not center He is a populist. Today i'll take him over anyone in the country because he is way better than others however i don't think his policies of distributing freebies will work in long term. This is perfect centrism- enabling fascism. 🔔\\n\\nHe is as opportunistic as one politician can get, its just he is going one extra mile on development that's why he bit bearable!\\n\\n\\n>Whether it was supporting Balakot air strikes and Article 370 move in Kashmir, staying away from JNU and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests at Shaheen Bagh, or chiding Pakistan for\\xa0interfering\\xa0in the Delhi election – Arvind Kejriwal is cautiously redrawing and refuelling the centre in Indian politics.\\n\\nHe asked for proof on Balakot air strike. He stayed away from JNU & CAA protests cause Delhi elections were near and he didn't wanted any controversy. He is still 'anti-national' liberal and opportunistic politician. Indian Bernie Sanders.\", \" One, I don't want to go to jail. \\n\\nTwo, a good proportion of dumb people means that my politics have to be dumb too, and something that will appeal to dumb minds. My dumb logic has to be right. This is very difficult, and only truly dumb politicians or truly smart politicians can pull this off. The acting level required is just too much.\\n\\nPolitics is too much of a commitment in a developing country. Real smart, committed idealistic people were once in politics. Most of us better educated, more intelligent people **today** are too practical to waste our lives in something where we are likely to fail. In our area there are a lot of educated middle class people who stood for elections, both local and national level. No one voted for them. These were people who are visible in local drives like trash cleaning, vaccination drives and other sundry matters. But no one votes for them. It is either BJP or Congress or some other established party. So its no use unless you have a lot of money to blow in deposit. I am not ready to sell my morality to the highest bidder yet. The IAS is an infinitely better option if you want the country to change. They are the ones who implement the policy in the first place rather than the politicians who are just there to sign. If anyone's name is Arnab please don't answer this question.\\n\\n(Check out OPs username)\\n\\nEdit: /s What is preventing you from joining politics? \\nAs for me, I'm just part of the pipeline that everyone goes through. A sheep, not a leader. I follow or remain ignorant. It's true that I am sorely disappointed by the state of affairs and want things to change. But that doesn't mean I would want to join politics. I can rather become an occasional activist and focus on my original passion. Joining politics needs a lot of commitment and thus time, which would just lead me to stray from my actual passion. So yeah, occasional activism works better for me. I am an introvert. I can't go around campaigning. Nor do I have funds it needs even give a decent fight. And I can't go around begging for funds too. But if I do get elected, say through RS, I would be willing to join politics and do the job. I think it's not a level field with all the goons currently present. Unless you have backing of some political group (which defeats the purpose), it is nearly impossible for a middle class guy to risk my life including the life of my family. While I know risks and can understand we need people who can work for common people and poor, it won't go unnoticed by the corrupt that I will be exposing a lot of their shit on the way. My political opinions are illegal. A few crores. [deleted] [removed] I was a member and still support a small party called Loksatta. They contested MLA elections in 2013 and Bengaluru municipal elections in 2015. Our candidates always came third or lower (behind BJP and Congress). It was disheartening. We put in money from our own pockets. Campaigned on the issues that matter. And yet, I saw first hand, how the so-called educated voters still view elections with a communal mind (religion and caste). I saw BJP and Congress workers openly bribing families in slums. That's when I realized it's hard. Delhi and AAp's victory was an exception, not the norm. India will remain a third world country because much of its people vote based on all the wrong priorities. The day voters hold leaders accountable for real important matters will be the day parties like AAP or Loksatta gain nationwide acceptance. But sadly I do not see that happening anytime soon. 1. Most elections are determined by campaign expenditure \\n2. People don't have the time, knowledge, awareness or critical thinking to assess their options \\n3. Politics has always been dirty and there is a very real chance of losing life and limb if you flip off the local mafia which is often also the local politician's family\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYou can still donate to the candidate you favour, if not in money you can volunteer, join their campaign and use your skills to help them win. Also, I am useless. I am honest and cannot dupe people. I like being alive I am some one who believe that an Individual has to think about his own development and making himself strong financially,mentally etc while not at all obstructing the development of fellow individuals . All these individuals make up the country and inturn mean that country will develop along with them . It is such a development where we no longer need any leader . Thus i stay away from politics . I know it sound unreal and cringy, but that is what i think . Have you joined politics?\\nIf not, what prevents you from joining? Iam not a yes person, politics requires yes people I need a godfather to enter in politics Just because one is disappointed with something, it doesn't warrant participation. If you aren't happy with a meal, you don't try to become the chef. You can complain and try to set things right or you just go where you find better food. There are millions who are sick of this country, not all of them are going to join politics. And just joining politics will in no way give matters into your own hands. I'm not 'allowing' myself to be governed poorly because I exercised my right and voted for whom I believed in, the problem is that person/party didn't win which is beyond my control. But is it really feasible for a graduate to take politics as a career? Don't have public speaking skills [deleted] >So wise men and women of India, what's preventing you from taking matters into your own hands? \\n\\nCan you tell me (or point to some document) the path I should follow if I want to do this? Assuming that I am a nobody in politics or social/public work. I want a team of well determined persons...people whom I can trust...those who can go without bread for a day if needed...guess it's only me..plus I have no money...without money you cannot do anything substantial...if you go to the root of problems...maybe your brain will pop out of your head...if not you have underestimated the problem itself ....because individual capacities are only marginally different compared to the problems we are facing...  \\nPeople like Gandhiji can bring a change but they come once in many years...until large number of individuals are committed to become gandhi themselves (given only few succeed)...there is no hope even if you join politics...playing a moral game is a titanic task Joining politics, aahh, I used to think about this. But when I saw the ground reality i.e. the issues of each constituency differ on the basis of caste/religion and class issues + the very fundamental issues of roti kapda makaan which have existed right from independence. \\n\\nMost of our citizenry hasn't been provided with the bare basics i.e. Food security, employment opportunities, law and order, and education.\\n\\nMost of us fight to fulfill all these needs.\\nInme se, jo bhi populist politicians provide/promise karte hain, vote unhi ko milta hai. (basically violating election spending norms all the time, everywhere)\\n\\nFir votes milte hain religion and caste based - state sanctioned benefits k basis pe.  \\nSo one needs resources, popularity, and good presence (on stage and in the news)\\n\\nPlus if one talks sense like how farm loan waivers are bad for the economy (empirically proven), then they'll be shown the door by the voters as they fall for the narrative created by opportunist politicians.\\n\\nAlso, very few voters can visualize the long term effects of any policy pursued by a government. Jab tak uske positive effects dikhte hain, another government gets the credit for it and vice versa. Public memory is actually very short lived. \\n\\nSo unless we improve the standard of education and thereby critical thinking, I believe, we, as a populace, deserve the politicians we get. After all, politicians are a mirror for our society.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I'll rather watch the fall of Rome from the comfort of my home,on WiFi. :P Itna Ameer nahi hai Mera baap Come from middle class family, don't have much backup.

If congress want to come back to power. They have to let go of the family thinking and choose a strong leader and a great speaker. Apparently people in India do not go after education and qualifications in a leader. Majority just want a leader who can give long buttery and dreams speeches. Nice :) Frankly speaking, we never gave Rahul Gandhi a chance. We always ridiculed him because of his errors while speaking. And soon, everybody started thinking of him as a joke. I\\'m not saying he would have been a good or a bad leader, but we never even saw him as one.

That is a flaw with the existing political set up. But unfortunately political commentators are considering that as a negative trait.

INC releases their manifesto which listed their promises in a great way and RG promised to carry out all of these. RG started campaigning in the south where his rallies were longer due to the translation required. Then he went on north where in every rally he would have approximately 20 minute speeches mainly speaking about unemployment, demonitization, and his NYAY. (Here is where he could have done it a little more aggressively as the fiercest statement would be Chowkidaar chor hai, never more than that.)\\n\\nAnd lets not forget, he had several interviews with various tv channels, and he occasionally vlogged on his youtube channel. He also held regular press conferences. On the other hand, Narendra didn\\'t have a single unscripted interview whilst also refraining from saying even a word in his press conference.\\n\\nTL;DR: RG used to be an inept politician but he improved a lot in the run up to the 2019 election.

Most modern economies are consumer based economy.\\nIt's almost impossible for a consumer based economy to recover from absolute lack of demand.\\nMore people losing jobs,- less money to spend- lack of demand - less growth of economy -. A vicious cycle.\\nHopefully they consult actual experts this time. Probably his biggest test since he became PM. Either blame Corona and let the economy go to the dogs or listen to experts and bring them on board to revive the situation. And don't even think about letting our FM handle the issue, she'll start screaming at everyone who questions her. He won't do shit economy wise!\\n\\nIt's all gonna be about CAA/NRC and election rallies once this is over. Of all things lacking, political courage is not one of them. Modi has taken decisions where others wouldn’t touch with a 10ft pole! He has the courage alright, but lacks people who are well-versed in economy to bring the country out of the mire brought on by his mad policies and coronavirus Better to ask if his bosses have political courage.\", \" [deleted] Modi is even stealing money from LIC and Bhakt have no problem with it.

I don't want this to be taken in the wrong sense, just want to understand the thinking behind it.\\nWhy is it that the Muslim community always looks at itself as an entity different from India. They have a rebellious approach towards everything happening in the world and would at no cost sacrifice a few religious rituals. \\nDuring this lockdown, we've had a couple of Christian and Hindu festivals but both the communities held the lockdown over their celebrations. But now during Ramzan we see huge crowds forming up in markets and places of worship, with no masks or distancing followed. \\n\\nI just mean to understand why this keeps happening. Requesting people to not turn this into an aggressive discussion. I hold nothing against any community. Man, I remember those childhood days when we fast during the day, not even swallowing saliva (I know, there is no such rule, kids were dumb) and run back home after school and go to the mosque for food.\\nIt was the best month all year \\n\\nThen you grow up, become an atheist, and don't fast, just have nostalgic memories.\", ' >The taxes you pay fund the army that kills/rapes/tortures Kashmiris. There’s blood on your hands and if you sense a rotting smell around you, it’ll be your ailing conscience.\\n\\nI\\'ve been saying this since 1999. Heck even Bollywood made movies on this same issue over and over again. We respected Army to the core but also kept them on pedestal for these crimes as well. We never were blind supporters of anybody. That\\'s why we were free to question every institution without fear. Today people say \"you are crazy to question Army\" and institutions? Well very convenient, who gave you that message, the perpetrators and it\\'s supporters I guess. Well a Rapist never likes to be called out for the crimes he did, why would he support the idea of questions?\\n\\nRest of the points, you described India in general since 2014. And these same people had problems when petrol prices were 5 rupees high. Now they don\\'t question even when it is +50 rupees high. Vegetables and rest other commodities +100 high. Because their brain has been washed. The media, the it cell, the zero pressure govt and it\\'s institution, the fear mongering, has made people fearful and weak. \\n\\nDon\\'t even for a minute ever think that this attempt to shoot was to create fear among Shaheen Bagh protestors. No, they are fearless and are not afraid to die even though they are dying slowly by protesting.\\n\\n This Shooting, Kunal\\'s Ban, Azad\\'s arrest, Rohith\\'s suicide, Kanhaiya\\'s false allegation not amounting to police chargesheet, Kalburghi+Pansare+Dabholkar+Gauri Lankesh Murders, Akhlakh+Pehlu Khan\\'s Murders, Child Asifa\\'s Rape in Temple, Judge Loya\\'s not so mysterious Death, Bhima Koregaon investigation pulled off, etc etc...everything has been done to show the people of India, DON\\'T REPEAT WHAT THEY DID OR YOU\\'LL FACE THE SAME FATE. My dad is an air force vet, and he himself questions the morality of soldiers who indulge in such heinous activities and soil the army\\'s name. However, he never blames the army, he targets that specific group of soldiers who have done this.

It doesn’t matter whether a person is rich or poor, people will still discriminate learning the name of an individual. This is a controversial topic, but how about adding some sections of the general class to the reservation? \\nIve seen people belonging to the general class slog it out while people for the reserved class have taken all benefit availed to them.\\nThey are not only well off, but they are literally exploiting the system. \\nThe reservation systrm wws introduced to even out the field, but people are now exploiting the system.\\n\\nThe government should definetly revise list of reserved Categories. The total reservation in some states is up to like 78%. It doesn\\'t make any sense. Do it for sure.....\\n\\nBut our neighbours, aunty uncle and professionals still ask...\\n.\\nOh.... \\nMr X uske aage\\nKumar....\\n\\nUske aage....\\n\\nAacha CASHTE kya hai tumhari.... One of the problems of the current reservation system is that even within the reserved communities, certain sections only are getting benefits and they collectively deny these benefits to the actual people for whom the reservation is meant in the first place.\\n\\nFor example, I know of several people of the SC and other reserved communities who are pretty well off, and still they end up using the reservation system. Because of many people like them, the people in their communities who are not at an advantageous position like them are being denied potential benefits.\\n\\nThe best way going forward in this situation would be to implement something on the lines of the Non-Creamy Layer (NCL) in all the present day reserved communties. Funny that most upper class folks - either wants to add poor upper class folks to reservation or get rid of it altogether.\\n\\nFor every \"I have seen rich SC/ST kid taking benefit\", there are 100X more case of middle/rich lower caste people getting discriminated because of their caste.\\n\\nTry buying a property or  even renting in the upper class locality being a lower class in Gujarat (guess same is the same in small towns elsewhere too). \\n\\nOr try starting a restaurant in small town where people know you are from lower caste. And see how many would visit?\\n\\nIts very easy to comment on something you haven\\'t gone through. A bench comprising of the Sanghi Arun Mishra. Not surprised. Not a single lower caste on the bench. This upper caste paternalistic attitude of we know what\\'s best for you lower castes is the fundament issue plaguing caste politics in india all the way back to the Poona pact. And not gonna change anytime soon Let me propose a solution which is fair to everyone. Reservation system was built so that we can all leave the caste system behind and be equal citizens. It was supposed to be demolished by now and would have if caste system was obliterated. Since we have proved that we, as Indians, are very much attached to the caste, let me propose a solution based on population. Let us pick up 2010 census data and give each category/caste/religion reservation as per their percentage of India\\'s population. 100% reservation. So say if a category is 10% of India\\'s population, give them 10% reservation wherever applicable. Everyone gets seats of their own category. There will be no general category. everyone will compete with their own caste.\\n\\nAgree that this looks like a pretty draconian solution but the caste system is draconian as well. This is the best solution we are yet evolved to deserve.\\n\\nThere are several demerits of this approach e.g. This will work to only increase rift between castes etc. But seems like people want only fair. This is fair. \\n\\nViews? Slow clap /s reservation hata do yaar, college admission mai time jo lag gaye the woh abhi tak yaad hai Discrimination to remove discrimination that\\'s **RESERVATION** for you. I think it would be very difficult to get data to establish this, SC judges are now just penning their fantasies in the garb of judgements. MOST deprived person should get the job/education seat, e.g. if there are two candidates, one\\'s  father is a rickshaw puller, another\\'s father is a clerk, the rickshaw puller\\'s son should get the seat/job. There should be provision of teaching lessons for so called forward cast because reserved category might become educated but the one who create more nuisance will always be there. How about this? Ignore the caste give reservation to poor, increase the imprisonment and penalties for caste discrimination crimes Hard agree!! About damn time. If done logically and transparently, this can be an extremely good move. Why don\\'t we use aadhaar and census data for this? I was not in favor of collecting data for aadhaar but now when it has been collected already, we should make use of it for things like this. Aadhar data can be positively put in use for so many things. This being one of them. About time. What I feel is irrespective of what , any student who has completed his education in a muncipal school should be the first beneficiary of reservation.

These two are blamed for all of India's problems and people are stupid enough to believe it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHonestly, as a dalit I sometimes wish let them remove reservation. Then let them explain to masses how 1% Indians are getting 73% Indian wealth. Within decade there will be riots in streets and true people responsible for Indian poverty will be found out. Sizable dalit tribal population doesn't understand how system is rigged against them, they think reservation is making some difference. These guys can finally wake up. You have 22.5% reservation for 29% SC,ST in government jobs which are just 4% of total jobs. And people think this is useful or something. The main question we need to ask is where are the damn jobs ? I have said previously that Scheduled Castes and Tribes are next on the list after Muslims.\\n\\nLooks like I was wrong. They're targeting everyone at the same time, just with a different approach. >The other problem is also the court’s selective affirmation of the state’s discretionary powers for providing reservations. When it comes to a decision not to provide reservations, the court feels the state has absolute discretion and need not collect data to justify this decision. But when the state wants to provide quotas, the court brings in the concept of equality and places several restrictions that dilute the discretionary power of the state. The 50% ceiling for quotas is an example of this restriction.\\n\\n\\nThis alone is enough to show how the SUPREME COURT is disingenuous and biased as hell and their end goal isn't equality of any sorts. First they stopped making it compulsory for promotion in government jobs and now will give only lower level jobs to reservations.\\nSecond they stopped compulsory arrest in SC/St act and will give pree arrest anticipatory bail to the accused.\\n\\nThis is the destruction of the act itself. \\n\\nBc reservation is not the government spooge to give its a bloody constitutional right. Get that modi shah I wish the govt does try fucking around with the reservations. I truly pray that they somehow think that by making their stooges pass such judgements that they can alter the basic tenets of reservations and try curtailing it. It will be the end of this govt. Period. Come on BJP/RSS! Try messing with reservations. Please. You can do it!! Show us how tough you are. First Moslems , now SC/ST ; good job BJP judiciary /govt . Golly what is with this government? Talk to upper caste, and they believe BJP is shit and giving SC/ST everything. Talk to SC/ST, they say its upper caste party\\n\\nWho the fuck voted for these mfs? I believe reservations  should be based on economic conditions and not on caste.\\nThe reason is many sc's and st's have a high family income yet take advantage of reservation.\\nOn the other hand there are many general candidates that have very low family income yet have no such advantage.\\n\\nReservations(if any) should be used to lift the distressed classes and not lift the already uplifted.\", ' It’s definitely a major factor.

And why should we care?\\n\\nCongress is responsible for its own downfall and we don't owe them anything. \\n\\nAs far as defeating BJP is concerned, congress is the biggest roadblock. Whenever congress is the biggest opposition in a state, BJP ends up winning easy or forms govt afterwards anyways. Mamata is holding her fort in WB, Kejriwal maintained his status in Delhi and Sharad Pawar halted BJP in Maharashtra. The country will be much better without the carcass of congress. Congress has tried to decimate local leadership since Rajiv Gandhi time .

Congress have themselves to blame. In regards to the Telugu states; few policy decisions were being made at the central level and many politicians used the word ‘high command’. The word high command even permeated into pop culture where it was parodied and used in movies, and people used to joke about it. \\n\\nAfter YSR’s death, the word high command became commonplace. It was embarrassing. People hated being controlled by a person sitting 1500kms away. They became spineless. All that Congress wants at the moment is for things go to so so bad that people just end up voting for Congress and Rahul Gandhi can be the PM. \\n\\nTheir insistence on not having a non-Gandhi PM candidate is crushing. They are proving everyone right in calling them a dynastic political party. Congress doesn't have anyone but itself to blame.\\n\\nThey actively refrained from campaigning in West Bengal and Odisha in 2019, and allied with wrong parties. For all practical purposes Congress is a relic of the past. \\n\\nMuslims used to vote for Congress. Now they have nowhere to go. They must organize their own Hindostan Party which would include every one except the Hindutva adherents.

Use this as an opportunity to weed out shitty people from your life. Good riddance. Aisa kachra life mein na ho to behtar hai. Deleted a close friend from my friend list because of the constant propaganda he was sharing on my timeline. So much hatred for Muslims even though he himself was in a relationship with a Muslim girl I lost 3 friends, one being my throughout school friend. I think I still have no regrets standing for what’s correct :) This is the biggest crime that Modi & Shah are guilty of: destroying the social fabric of the country through the use of classic propaganda and brainwashing techniques, but using social media. No other politician has achieved this on such a scale.\\n\\nThe only people who escaped the spell of these two rogues are a small minority who are naturally sceptical about everything. Looks like your friend didn\\'t escape the spell.\\n\\nIt is no coincidence that the growing opposition to ShahModi now is coming from young people, who have a better understanding of how media manipulation works and who possess a natural scepticism about things that their parents\\' generation blindly believes in. I haven\\'t lost friends but I\\'m seriously reconsidering breaking up some friendships. A lot of people aren\\'t really having a lot in their lives to talk about and it\\'s easy to talk about politics. \\nI have always been a centrist in my political views and it seems as few want me to join their \"team\". It\\'s a dirty game, but you don\\'t have to play it. I can be your friend OP :) Sad, but I went through this just the other day. I knew he was a bhakt, but not such a violent one with such low regard for human life. Long story short, it wasn\\'t even a discussion, he outright started abusing me because I shared a post on my feed about keeping personal information safe, etc. Minutes later, a friendship of 13 odd years just disappeared. It\\'s better to cut these kinds of people out, the sooner the better. They: don\\'t lose friendship over politics, yaar\\n\\n\\nMe: Can\\'t lose friendship over humanity, yaar. Goodbye. Why do you want to be friends with such a bigot? I remember a quote from a game which aptly describes your dilemma , it goes like this \\'\\' Friends, who want to remain friends, don\\'t discuss religion or politics\\'\\'.\\n\\nBut, we need to draw a line somewhere, if your friend starts justifying premeditated  violence on innocent citizens, then it\\'s time to start evaluating your friendship. Welcome to my world buddy. You are in the same boat as I. My best friend has turned into a soft bhakt and justifies every action of the govt one way or the other. He is one of the kindest man I know and about 80% of his friends are Muslims and yet the cognitive dissonance persists. The only difference between our situations is we do not post memes and articles in our common group. We both know where the other stands politically and I call out on his bullshit if he open his mouth regarding the CAA or NRC debacle but we keep it respectful.\\n\\nWe don\\'t name call each other. We have a mature conversation and usually never come to an agreement. The only thing I ever said that was harsh was that hope he doesn\\'t stand on the pavement while his muslim friends are being hauled into an uncertainty and shouting that they should get into the vans because the govt said so. He kept quiet and never spoke about the CAA issue with me ever again. We meet now and talk about life in general. Keep politics minimal. There is a tacit understanding that we value the friendship more than our political differences. Kanhaiya Kumar actually raised this point in his recent speech at JNU. Modi is dividing families and friends. *First they ignore you, then they laugh at you,* ***then they fight you***, *then you win* Distance yourself from these venomous snakes. >they saw it but the difference of opinion never affected our friendship.\\n\\nthat\\'s because you\\'re a privileged \"moderate\" who prefers negative peace to positive justice. politics always affects people you were just privileged enough to not care. Indian people don\\'t know about the term \"opinion\". They are stupid and have a mentality of if your opinion is not same as mine, fuck you! I was just saying today how this moment in time has brought out the true colours of so many people we know. On one hand it\\'s shocking to see the hate and utter stupidity but on the other it\\'s heartening to see the good. \\n\\nYou need to decide whether you\\'re okay being friends with these people. They aren\\'t just people who have a difference in political opinions. They\\'re straight up hate-mongering, blood-thirsty, bigoted pieces of filth. Recently I have lost my good friend too. He doesn\\'t used to be like that, but he is acting differently. He started saying that most of the muslim doesn\\'t know what actually CAA and started the crap. Then he said after explaining these thing to muslim dominated  community in bangalore everyone changed their mind and they are in support of CAA. A convenient story to dismiss ones view, I am sure he is using the WhatsApp forward messages. Then I argued with him that CAA itself is unconstitutional as you are discriminating on the basis of religion. Then he started saying this is very emotional matter to him, started crying about Hindus in other country. I said u could take the persecuted in your country regardless of religion or country. Then he said we cant take everyone as we have enough population so discarding few of them. I had enough explaining him about this but he is not listening and asking me to change my mind. If this is the case then they weren\\'t WORTHY friends to begin with\\n\\nI assume liberal Germans lost a lot of friends to Nazi politics\\n\\nU know they stayed silent and what happened then?\\n\\nSS killed all Liberal activists. U r speaking up and not submitting to authority that\\'s why Modi is silent else he wud have impose 144 everywhere. Jab tum mehgayi berozgari or Mandi ki baat karoge to main tumhe Hindu muslim me uljha dunga\\n\\nache din aagaye Mitrooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnn See if he your true and old  friend, then you should not care about his political views at all, like seriosuly just don\\'t discuss politics with everyone or scrutinize everyone\\'s social media post. It is not worth it family and friends are made not of similarity of political views but on relations and experiences. .\\n\\n\\nPlease don\\'t consider doing a weeding out or something like that of friends over political views or stuff, it would just leave you friendless in an echo chamber of \"new friends\" with only common thing being politics. There is much more to life than modi or politics, just discuss that...there is like a 1000 issues to discuss which you guys might see exactly same, why fight over one thing you guys differ ????? People who support murderers and criminals are accomplices\\n\\nI don\\'t want to be friends with criminal accomplices Welcome to the boat! I am also trying to reason out with friends as much as I can. \\n\\nOne question I got asked is \"Look at the situation of West Bengal, these immigrants are creating violence and chant anti national slogans. Why should we tolerate them?\"  \\n\\n\\nI am not too aware of the realities in West Bengal though. Is it that only immigrant Muslims cause trouble there? Can someone please enlighten me about the above point. I feel like Social Media has a huge part in this. 10 years ago, no one would talk about politics in person with the kind of intensity we use on social media. How old are you? \\n\\n\\nI had to cut off ties and leave my the WhatsApp groups for the same reason during the first week of strikes. It was appalling to see people who I have known for years to defend the violence/BJP. \\n\\nI’m at an age where I don’t want myself to be surrounded by enablers. Everything was “changa si” with labels and stuff but if one comes around and defends/justifies the kind of violence which happened on 15/12 and 05/01, then piss off, mate. I just ended two friendships after reading this, was contemplating since a long time. I\\'m a Muslim and the past few months have been very emotionally hard. Hard to the point of being unreal. I was incessantly posting on social media and these two friends who I  used to be close with before the Jamia incident, started fading out on me. After much thought, I felt like I don\\'t need people who maintain false pretense and say shit like \"Politics beech mein mat la yaar\". In current time, it feels like gaslighting to a Muslim. This happens when we grow balls to talk about something we are invested or excited in. But honestly, given your description, it\\'s just a difference of opinions. Maybe go to their place, spend time with them, but don\\'t bring up this topic. Remember JNU came now, these are your old friends. Are you really open for discussion? No, because when you post something \"without censorship\" others should be OK but when someone else has contrary view to you start with a judgement (you mention you gave him benefit of doubt) that they are somehow wrong or misguided and you are not. Then you mention you talk to them (rather convince them to switch sides) and when they too present their uncensored opinion, you get rattled.\\n\\nIs it not hypocritical?

Before the Maharashtra elections, there was a clear verbal agreement between the SS and the BJP that power would be shared, and SS would choose its own representative to be the CM for the first 2.5 years. This was hammered out between Amit Shah and UT. However, Fadnavis was not part of this discussion. Fadnavis was known as a Narendra Modi acolyte who often bypassed Amit Shah. His slogan internally during the elections was \"Dilli mein Narendra, yahan pe Devendra\". After the elections, he was triumphantly setting himself up for a second term, when the SS pulled the rug under him, reminding the BJP of the agreement with Amit Shah. Then all hell broke loose, and that is how we have a SS-NCP-Congress Government in Maharashtra. Amit Shah sat back and watched as Fadnavis\\'s wing\\'s were clipped. Reported for bullshit This sounds absolute nonsense to me. Coz communal politics is going as strong as ever. And why is it only UP police, why not other bjp states too? [deleted] :D you do paint the BJP as Siths man. There are always two I didn\\'t see a cow in this table. Where is the cow? Seems plausible. Every megalomaniac thinks his subordinates are replaceable. Trump will not doubt will this coming election that too without any second in command of Shah stature. To Modi, Trump\\'s MO of power wielding probably seems like heaven - surround yourself with nincompoops and do whatever you want because the public loves you. Yes, it makes total sense.\\n\\nProbably why there\\'s so much conflict between Shah and Doval. Both are doers. But one is a no name government employee and the other is a well known and dangerous goon. Modi prefers people that do not have any personal political standing.\\n\\nBut I dont quite believe it. Not just yet. Modi will still run to Shah come UP elections. Tf is this blinds and gossip bullshit Amit Shah was there in cabinet meetings. Saw at-least 3-4 photos of different meetings. He\\'s probably taking a break from being at forefront. Perhaps Shah took responsibility for Delhi wipeout and retreated into the shadows /s I hope, maybe even after a lot of years later, we get to watch a movie/read a book with the actual dirt that went on inside BJPs office during these years. Who do you guys think would write that book? provide the source please. I think it\\'s not his \"thing\". Shah will surface again when the time come. But don\\'t think modi is different than shah. Don\\'t look at what someone says look at what they does. Remember kapdo se he pahchan me aa jata hai? Before saying stop communalizig corona they let full 10-15 days communal poison spread. Their purpose is fulfilled. Now they are just waiting this this to end and than they\\'ll start doing it again. Remember ayodya verdict? Every was told sab court ka nirday manenge and they had already bought the judges meanwhile. These are some real samples of pure evil people working together. They aren\\'t going to change their politics overnight. They have been doing this all their life. This is all they know. The probability of this happening is very less. Modi and Shah know that both can\\'t function without each other. Why would Modi say that irrespective of everything. Their entire politics is based on the communal division and fooling people. Advani ka sath thik na hua xD This is all rubbish. Either Shah is corona positive or he is busy planning Rajsthan MP buyout.

Generally, the ones who prefer online education are tech-savvy, urban people and they should be able to shell out 400 rupees a month.

Most of Indian students are in mid-sized to small towns, where 400 rupees is a big amount and parents would think twice before spending.

No one knows when the economy will go haywire.\\n\\nThe world\\'s best economists didn\\'t see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!\\n\\nAnd since Urjit didn\\'t bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.\\n\\nThe replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.\\n\\nMr. Das with his master\\'s in history will offer nothing but support to the government\\'s ideas.\\n\\nModi wants the reserves to come out, creating a temporary surge in growth. He will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 Elections.\\n\\nIf these things happen, he truly will have fucked up the economy. I\\'m buying lube and preparing my anus. Demo 2.0 is right around the corner They got Das for one simple reason. For the ~~1 lakh~~ 3 lakh crore that Jaitley and gang are eyeing. \\n\\nThe request for that money to be given from RBI reserve, will come in a week or two. \\n\\nIn a month, there’ll be more loans being dolled out by banks, more mudi kaka posters, more photo ops, more statues of mudi kaka himself if possible and Ofcourse, for ram mandir. \\n\\nThese people will leave the country in ashes.  I have one request from all of you(people who understand beyond Mandir-Masjid, BJP-Cong). Start educating people on our parliamentary system about MLAs MPs start with your friends, your domestic help tell them how it is done, counsel them(not on which party to vote for but how it affects them). \\n\\nLet\\'s start something from our side to save whatever we have left! [deleted] >What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don\\'t seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. \\n\\nI hope the opposition takes to the social media and tells us what these people are up to. Most of us have a bare minimum education in matters of economics.  [removed] He\\'s got a history degree and has no idea about the economics. He\\'s a government yes man,a puppet.\\n\\nThe government wants to take a huge risk and damage the countries financial stability,in return for short term gains.\\n\\nThe movement of wealth from cash to bonds shows that this is just too risky Dude is MA History.  All his predecessors have been PhD in Economics and Banking.  He is just a Jately lapdog.   [deleted] A reminder to everyone.  RBI asked PayTM to remove the CEO of Paytm payment bank because she did not have any banking experience. And now Jately ji has brought in a no banking experience/no economist(MA History) to head RBI. They think we are retarded. \\n\\nAnd to reply to another comment, these sarkari training certificates have no weight what so ever. I did an MBA from one of these Indian Institute tags and we train many a sarkari afsars usually IAS,IRS and IFS. They just have to attend a few sessions and they get the certificate. Getting a PhD from Yale or Harvard or MIT involves original research work. \\n\\nAnd on top of everything this dude implemented demonetisation.  No economist worth their salt would have let this happen.  I\\'m not worried if some person without some academic background gets appointed as the Governor of RBI as long as his actions are carefully considered and sane. Also, as other commenter pointed out, it\\'s the board members who make the decisions collectively and we have experts from different fields of study in the board.\\n\\nWith all that said, it\\'s still a very bad decision made by the government. I mean, it\\'s not unexpected that they chose someone who supported the DeMon to the core despite its serious flaws. Also, his politically conservative attitude which he fearlessly displayed in the past is something that\\'s troubling regarding his appointment. I\\'m supportive of people with very little or no academic background but with sufficient experience working in different related fields of relevance making it into key positions in apex level organizations but this man is clearly chosen with a different motive in mind.\\n\\nAs for the boards and its members being key decisions makers in the organization, I won\\'t be surprised if they\\'re to replaced with other like minded experts as our newly appointed governor if the present members show any kind of disappointment in the decision taking. No organization is devoid of factions but what we\\'ve seen till now is that these apex organizations were given a significant freedom to operate on those level of factions that were divided on academic grounds which is undeniably a healthy division. But the recent divisions that developed within the organization are toxic to this organization and thereby to the country as a whole because the core ideology is that of political, rather than being an economic or social one.\\n\\nThis appointment is very much like the appointment of Betsy DeVos as US secretary of education or Kavanaugh\\'s appointment to the US Supreme Court. Abuse of power and unhealthy political involvement in matters that are unrelated. Let\\'s see how this will unfold in times to come.  To me, it matters less what his academic or research credentials are. A lot of people with less formal credentials can do good jobs. What matters more is that he is a Government stooge. Totally agree with you. Mr Das has corruption allegations against him as well.  Pre 2014 RBI was eyeing implementation of basel norms, and now RBI itself is getting its \"pillars\" stripped 😑 He was mouthpiece of government during demo. It\\'s election time and government will try everything possible to remain in power.\\n\\nRBI reserves will be used as election funds. Loan wievers, ect . Will there be any announcements or news once he hands over a part of the reserve to Mudi Kaka and Blog minister?  I dunno but I get the hunch that even this guy will not be able to tolerate the PM and his gang\\'s nonsense and he will also leave.. Generally (historically) how much time the previous governments taken to decide on the next governer? Daru will help to get over someone 😂 Nothing surprising saar. Inmates running the asylum is trademark of bjp Guys, he\\'s an alumnus of IPE and has a masters in finance from there it seems. Just saying, not stating he\\'s the guy for the job at all, cause he\\'s not. ITT posters citing Wikipedia as source for Shaktikanta Das\\'s qualifications. SMH vigorously.  tax payers are fcuked Why do you bring the rape analogy here! \\\\>   Or are we just following \\'hard work > Harvard\\' bull shit. \\n\\nI definitely do not agree with this. The Harvard passouts I have personally met so far have been bitter disappointments. Mostly because expectations from such people are high but also they are usually not experts in their fields or really intend to be. I dont have enough knowledge to say whether this is a good thing or not, But atleast his wikipedia page seem to indicate that he has done schooling in Finance in IIMB and National Institute of Banking Management. He also had held posts in various government revenue organizations.  Not sure, if these are good enough but i dont think they just appointed a guy with just MA History degree as RBI governor. He seems to have some relevant qualification and experience. He has experience in economics related field. PhD in economics doesn\\'t means that you should be selected. Even Raghuram  pursued IIT and later did MBA. Did he had an economic background from the start? No.\\n\\nThis guy might not be the best option but let the guy even work. I know he is a puppet of the government but give some time at least. Turns out he does have a background in finance and management education as suggested by his Wikipedia page To be fair, RBI is supposed to serve the government. If urjit wasn\\'t doing what the government was asking then they have the right to replace him. Because we will blame the government for poor economic policies and vote them out, not the RBI.

Some people were complaining that why Kerala has been allocated so less amount compared to Maharashtra. There were several speculations and baseless theories (eg- north-south discrimination) but none of the critical comments, in my knowledge, mentioned about the finance commission recommendations, which is the actual reason. None of them bothered to critique the recommendations.\\n\\nI think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by XV-FC in allocation of state share of SDRMF funds. People critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page 99 onwards. This will help them base their criticism on actual facts, rather than their imagination. You can give all the justification and 'due process' you want. We all know the *real* reason why Delhi got 0. >The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is  because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi  in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state.\\n\\nYes so Delhi must get money then directly from centres funds right? like NDRF or the PM relief fund. I'm sure we have lots of funds for unforseen circumstances which have funds but can be used for this emergency especially with Delhi becoming an epicentre after the tablighi fiasco Leave all technicalities. Can someone tell me how is Delhi supposed to operate without this fund? Basically the question is why were these alternate mechanisms not used? Great post u/ringtring. Kejriwal has been moaning about not receiving funding to combat the crisis and this is a great post explaining why Delhi was not allocated funds.\\n\\nEither Kejriwal does not know the reason (mentioned in the post) or is willingly not mentioning it to create a sense of bias against AAP by the centre. Either way, he needs to get his facts right. Nice research with Finance commission recommendations.\\n\\nBut the recommendations of the FC is ADVISORY and hence NOT BINDING on the govt. . So nothing like constitutional obligations. \\n\\nAlso PM Cares has a lot of fund now so it can be used straight away ... so I feel the ball is in Central govt. court now to get funds for Delhi and put the end to this issue and not politicise by playing around. I think Kejriwal is all in his rights to ask for funds.\\n\\nhttp://www.arthapedia.in/index.php?title=Finance_commission [deleted] What nonsense.

Your accusation of judicial activism is severely misplaced.\\n\\n> It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis\\n\\nI wonder why the SC saw issues with how it has been setup.\\n\\nThe job of SC is to make sure than every citizen of the union gets treated equally. It is also to reign in on power excesses. The executive branch is already the most powerful branch of the three and we need SC to balance the structure. Do we know how much of that money did they allocate to each state?\", ' >Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.\\n\\n\\nSame excuse the bhakths giving for Modi.\\n\\n\\nI like your interesting take on Mamata where you\\'ve conveniently ignored the following:\\n\\n\\n1. Corruption - Only Mamata bhakths believe that she and her party members had nothing to do with the Sarada scam. Or the other chit funds. The cases are still pending and the money is totally gone. Whatever money was returned to the few was taken out from the state funds. A bridge collapsed in the middle of city and tmc government didn\\'t bat an eye. Trifala scam has started again. There\\'s too many to list here, but do check what Abhishek Banerjee has been doing for the last few years. \\n\\n\\n2. Intolerance - Calling students Maoists and arresting them. Arresting professors and putting them behind bars without fair trial for posting a simple meme. Police violence in JU. Torturing civil service officers to suicide. \\n\\n\\n3. Lies and Jumla - park street rape case. The accused escaped and his gf who aided his escape was taken into the party. Mamata assassinated the character of the rape victim just to give a clean chit to the accused. Everyone forgot that it seems. In this regard, care to elaborate what\\'s she\\'s doing with the covid 19 testing to hide the numbers? Social media is rife with tells of how people are being turned away from hospitals, and that\\'s not bjp propaganda. I\\'m receiving news from my friends who are doctors that there\\'s state sponsored propaganda to hide the numbers. Mamata even went as far to forcefully audit the deaths to co-morbid conditions so that the covid report can be suppressed. Funny thing is, unless there\\'s co-morbid conditions, you\\'ll not even die from covid, that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not spreading.\\n\\n\\n4. Industrial output - pray tell what Mamata has done to improve the state\\'s industrial output? Where are the jobs? We\\'ve all been hearing the empty lies from the biswa bangla summit, how many of the those projects ever came to fruition?\\n\\n\\n5. Minority appeasement - while Modi is trying to get rid of muslims, Mamata is doing the opposite, going as far as to ignore the criminal elements in the society to pander to that votebank. The attack on doctors that sparked a protest across the country was fueled by the simple fact that Mamata didn\\'t have the guts to arrest the criminals because they were Muslims, even when the rational Bengali Muslim community tried denouncing them over and over. She has given the statement that those who came from Bangladesh and have voted are now citizens even if they have come recently, what the fuck? Mamata doesn\\'t get to decide who gets citizenship. We don\\'t want Bangladeshis here, no matter if they are Hindu or Muslim. Her government had even shielded war crime convicts just to get some brownie points. Why?\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s no difference between Modi and Mamata except the fact that while the first one is trying to get rid of the Muslims, the second one was trying to alleviate them to a godlike status (one imam from a Bengali masjid gave the statement a few years ago that the Muslims will decide who gets to become the CM of WB). Other than that, the lies and jumla are just as widespread, the corruption just as deep. The only reason Mamata gets away with all this is because Bengal has became irrelevant in the national stage. No one gives a shit. Else she\\'s just as corrupt and authoritarian as Modi. And if talking about the developments, these are all being done with a single strategy. Destroy Bengal\\'s industrial output, evict all the educated folks, so whoever left becomes solely dependant on the state for their livelihood. Meanwhile she and her goons can continue ruling the state like the left has done for last 3 decades. That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\n\\nBengali\\'s have no hope left. It\\'s TMC or BJP, and both are cancerous in their own ways. Only chance is for an Arvind Kejriwal to rise, but that\\'s probably never gonna happen. Most educated and literate bengali\\'s are leaving the state, who\\'s gonna rise to the occasion? There should be a trade off between socialism and Capitalism.\\n\\nSomething in between so everyone can benefit. [deleted] Nice writeup bro. \\n\\nHow’s the popularity of BJP among Bengalis ? I heard they are gaining ground in some spots and local polls . \\n\\nDo you think communists supporting the BJP will affect TMC much ? Okey let\\'s list pros and cons of Mamata and TMC\\n\\nPros: 1) Mamata is authoritarian but still TMC regime is way more free than the previous CPM rule. It was possible to openly post against TMC in social media. Such open criticism of the government or party was impossible for most people earlier.\\n\\n2) Rural infrastructure is developed a lot in comparison to previous regime. Roads are improved a lot.\\n\\n3) The police and the government offices are more active.\\n\\n4) Smaller crimes like eve teasing and theft are reduced in my experience.\\n\\n5) The government and the party is secular and not racist  at all which is a big plus point in todays India.\\n\\n6) Economy of the state is improved.\\n\\n7) Government officials and police has more power than the previous regime where they were puppets of the local party office.\\n\\nCons: 1) One woman party and government. Due to her tendency to control everything her government is full with people who are good for nothing and totally useless. She doesn\\'t like people who would argue with her.\\n\\n2) Her intolerance against opposition.\\n\\n3) TMC is full with goons and politicians whose sole aim is to make money by hook or crook.\\n\\n4) \"Appeasement\" of big groups of people for vote.

Can't afford groceries if the lockdown goes on for another month. Sure, suggest us to buy cheap properties. Fucking real estate assholes. To a hammer,every problem looks like it can be fixed by a nail. Fact of the matter is real estate is a bad investment in India. You may buy a house if you wish to live in it. However as an investment vehicle with pitiful rental yields of 2-3% due to over supply in most cities, it is a renter's market.\\n\\nBuying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate. REAL ESTATE SHOULE BE THE LAST THING one should be investing in , in the next 12-15 months.\\n\\n1. Rental yields from a rented home would barely be enough to cover the EMI of a housing loan ( let alone act as a secondary source of income ) \\nI'm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Houses are highly illiquid investments. With the kind of job losses predicted over the next 12-15 months , one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible. If there are no takers for your house , you will have virtually no  liquidity on hand to provide for emergency expenditures ( mom and dad falling ill, deferred jobs for your sons and daughters , layoffs for you etc ) \\n\\n\\n\\n3. Post corona,  the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon. Most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities. There will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour. \\n\\nSo expect massive delays on projects that are under construction . \\n\\n\\nA large number of real estate firms will wind up. Quite a few will be stuck in litigation . You money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset. \\n\\n\\nWe are going through a highly irregular time. This is not a good time for such stupid investment decisions \\n\\nPSA : Stay away from this wall of text put up by OP !!!!! \\n\\nReal estate is the last thing a smart man should be looking at for the next 15-24 months. \\n\\nPark your savings in easily liquifiable and safe investments for the time being. ( FDs and savings accounts and maybe a few blue chip stocks ) \\n\\n\\nPLEASE DO NOT INVEST IN REAL ESTATE. OP SEEMS TO BE SOME DOUCHE TRYING TO SELL SNAKE OIL BEHIND A WALL OF TEXT!!\", ' China is a snake dressed as a puppy. Best blocked. Look how the CCP is protesting now saying that India\\'s protections violate the WTO rules. Where were the WTO rules when lakhs of crores worth of state sponsorship was given to CCP companies to dump products everywhere at prices lower than the raw material costs, simply to kill the domestic manufacturers? You cannot even get a Diwali lamp that\\'s made in India these days, and it is because local makers cannot compete with the state subsidized manufacturing and dumping by China. \\n\\nHonestly, if a startup is really good, money will flow in from everywhere. Companies like Paytm are not real innovations. They are data mining operations. Great startups have marquee investors from US, Singapore, Korea etc. We don\\'t need China. \\n\\n\\nThey have taken over companies all across EU and Australia. They sneak in, then buy it completely. > Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket \\n\\nThese companies are hardly innovative and just do the middleman business but online. Too much VC money is not good for whole business ecosystem. These companies are subsidizing to create mono/duo-poly, and crushing down the other competing domestic startups. We don\\'t want that. \\n\\n> Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? \\n\\nHDFC is a [systemically important bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution). In short, a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis. They are colloquially referred to as \"too big to fail\". Owning every % of HDFC is like owning a part of Indian economy, So obviously Indian Govt. will loose their shit if China invest more in this company. > Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government.\\n\\nDude, what the hell are you smoking? Indian startups are mere copycats of Western businesses! Flipkart copied Amazon, Ola copied Uber, Oyo copied Airbnb, PayTM copied Paypal, Zomato copied Yelp, the list goes on!\\n\\n> 1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC.\\n\\nHDFC Ltd. is a lending company with deep ties to the banking sector. Even a 1% stake lets them get into the board, and they get veto powers. A CCP-owned firm having veto powers in one of the largest banking organizations of the country? No, thanks!\\n\\n> 2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It\\'s clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required?\\n\\nWhile I agree that the finance ministry is daft in regards to various policy matters since it is controlled by the PMO; a veto against China won\\'t kill startups. What kills startups are their lack of revenue management. Almost all startups are running in losses! How long will financers back these companies? Businesses exist to generate profit; yet most modern startups don\\'t have those plans in sight (both Indian and foreign startups as well).\\n\\n> 3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?\\n\\nWhy should government systems provide financial aid to companies, both startups as well as established businesses? That whole line of thinking is wrong in my opinion. Unfortunately, the worst precedent was set when government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Yes, businesses have been hurt by Covid-19; and a lot of them have incurred losses as well. Isn\\'t it part of running a busines? If startups don\\'t learn to not put all their eggs in one basket, the government cannot help it. The most a government can do (and I am not talking BJP / Congress here) is relax taxation and bureaucratic mess of paperwork to ease startups to get back to their feet. I don\\'t think India has banned investments. They just made it mandatory to seek government approval before its done.\\n\\nIf China is pissed they can take it up theirs.\\n\\nYou just need to look at Australia, if you want to see what giving China free rein could mean in a tough situation. What are the anti takeover laws you are talking about? Do you have an example of any country implementing it successfully? \\n\\nNot in a harsh tone, just curious. I do not understand why everyone thinks they are financial experts and the people running the country with advisors who are some of the best experts in their fields are all idiots.\\n\\nAs for answering your question, you have to think bigger and broader than just startups, as an effect of coronavirus there is going to be a recession and most industries would be going into red, so as to avoid hostile takeovers and keep the industries safe the decision was taken.\\n\\nYou should open your mentality a little broader and read about what China has done in Maldives and how much debt Maldives is in right now. You can also Google about what China is doing in Africa.\\n\\nInstead of appreciating when the country actually takes steps to protect its national interests and assets here you are deriding it and favouring China.

I don't feel it's a danger currently, but may become a danger in future after NRC labels Indian citizens as illegal immigrants.\\n\\nOn the other hand, they are currently seizing properties of CAA protestors in UP. That is much more alarming. nazis were defeated in 1945.\\n\\nrss remained. What is the bullshit you are peddling. Enemy Properties act is a very old act. Read about it first.\", ' Get a trusted relative or a close friend of him and ask them to explain all what you said to your father. I mean get someone who is true well-wisher of your dad and is someone who your father listens to. Your dad only reason for opening school is to gain social influence among his peers and community. \\n\\nI don\\'t think he will stop this madness until he is starved of his savings .\\n\\nIf he was so concerned about kids , he would have funded underprivileged children education rather than starting a school. Just make sure he doesn\\'t start contacting any European women while he\\'s at it. I don\\'t understand this! You dad wants to start a school? Or does he want to teach?\\n\\nEach of them are very different adventures! * Have you tried to find out what is motivating him to start the school? \\n* Show him some examples of the \"risk\" associated with running a play school. Especially the legal risk (that could be deterrent to some).\\n* Assume he doesn\\'t have other fall-back options (financial) for his own care/ medical expenses, then highlight that too.\\n* Considering that your Father has had considerable expertise in some field in the Govt sector, why not redirect him to a start a consulting firm in his core area of expertise? There are still area where experience matters, especially in Govt sector.. Don\\'t support him financially right now, because you\\'ll just be enabling him. Besides when he goes broke, you\\'ll be one who they turn to. Show him Mota Bhais photo To be honest it sounds like he won\\'t listen to you. I would suggest:\\n\\n\\n1) try to talk to him using numbers, charts, as someone suggested\\n\\n2) speak to your brothers, get them to understand the financial risk, and get them to commit to supporting your dad when he loses all his savings\\n\\n3) when the above don\\'t work, speak sternly to your dad. Tell him you\\'ll limit the money you\\'ll give him when he burns through his. Prepare for everyone to get pissed off at you.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately it\\'s your financial future at stake. Everyone is going to throw kulcha in your face. Be prepared for this to become a big stink, and for him to lose all his money and for you to have to support him for the rest of his life anyway. But at least you would have tried, and can tell him and your siblings you told them so when they ask you to give up 40% of your income looking after him. If your dad wants to open a professional school,take him to see how one functions.After govt job in UP,he may have very different expectations of how work happens.Seeing a functioning one would give him context and feel for the entire project,instead of stubbornly dithering in the dark.  \\nIf your dad just wants prestige he thinks he deserves cause of govt job,but didnt get after retirement,and is trying to manufacture said by throwing money around,abandon ship. He has to come to terms with fact that the time to throw money around has passed. I can think of two things. Either convince your dad or reduce his liquidity.\\n\\nYour mother tried to talk with him? What is her stand? Can she convince your father to put at least some money in her name in non flexible instruments like NSC, PPF or tax free bonds, gold, small peice of land?\\n\\nWould it be helpful to visit to a financial counselor who can point out how little 15- 25 lakh is to spend retired life?\\n\\nWould it be a good idea to convince him to be associated with an educational institute for a couple of years and learn tricks of the trade?\\n\\nWould he be willing to be associated with a NGO that works in field of education?\\n\\nCan you try to talk to engage him with other people who tried education business but failed?\\n\\nIf everything fails, I think you should make it very clear that you will not support him financially. Whether you do so or not is a choice that you can make in future. \\n\\nTread carefully on this last one. It will surely break his heart. You also risk to loose inheritance. I am just hoping that this will give him a shock and may be he will consider what he is doing. Ask him to take up full time/part-time teaching job in some govt school. No risk, impart knowledge, earn some pocket change and keeps him occupied. Let him burn it and when he is dependable on you, ruin his life witb many \"I told you so\\'s\".\\n\\nOn a serious note, play school is not a very good venture to put your money in currently and its gonna br very hard to push towards profit and needs a lot of effort. So slowly do some research and shift it in your dads house buy out a share and be a 50% partner, talk like a businessman and tell him now you would handle it.\\n\\nThen hire that coordinator and just give your dad a share and tell him to relax.\\n\\nBut make sure someone your dad listens to passes on all this to him, your dad seems to be one of those people who never listen to their kids. This is a general issue with Indian parents. They raise children as investments and expect returns from them when the children become capable (else you get labelled as \\'nalayak\\' or \\'kamini aulaad\\' by the society). They don\\'t care about saving for the future, or about how they\\'ll get money when it runs out, since you\\'re always going to be there when things get hard. It\\'s one of the pitfalls of a closely-knit rather than individualistic culture (but that\\'s the discussion for another day).\\n\\nI and my brother are going to be very set financially. I have an awesome job with amazing pay and my brother is in a very good college and is generally pretty good at what he does. However, I already warned my parents to not see us as investments which will generate returns and rather save for your retirement. I\\'m still going to help them if things get bad, but it won\\'t be because they managed money poorly. As a result, they\\'ve started saving and investing money for themselves and aren\\'t speculating real estate anymore.\\n\\nI think you also need to do the same. Ask him how does he think he\\'ll survive once his saving runs out. If he has a plan, good. If he doesn\\'t, make it clear that you won\\'t help as you\\'ve got your mouth full in a bad economy. MAKE THIS VERY, VERY CLEAR. He needs to be fucking adraid. If he still manages to get into a bad spot financially due to external factors, help him obviously. But this should stop him from squandering money.\\n\\nIf he wants to be nobel and wants to help, tell him to teach people at home for free or volunteer for free at a school or NGO nearby. There\\'s a lot of help people can do with time rather than money. Why you do this op. Quit your job and help out your enterprising dad. You are lucky to have a dad who has this entrepreneurial spirit. Bc, you should help him reach his goal. This is the major problem with Indian society you don\\'t support people who start a business. You need to help him attain this goal. \\n\\nA man at that age is having ambition is a rare occurrence. It\\'s tells that he will have character and commitment. I don\\'t understand why you judge that he won\\'t succeed. You need to believe in him and his goal. He will do great , help him do great. \\n\\nAs an entrepreneur this is my piece of mind', ' I really really appreciate what you had to say. We are screwed on so many fronts that I honestly believe CAA js a good facade for the government to keep people engaged. Good news is that people are coming out in large numbers. \\nThe anti-muslim, anti-dalit anti-anything that isn\\'t savarna Hindu (that too a very very specific type) policy is dangerous and the govt will unfortunately carry it out via the front or the back door.\\nI have also learnt a good lesson now- no party should get absolute power. The federal structure of government was designed by our founding fathers for a very sound reason. This is beautifully written. Can\\'t disagree with any of it. Do you believe all of this will end in a remotely democratic manner? As in bjp\\'s removal through elections? Or is it likely all bloodbath and genocide from here on culminating in civil wars and perhaps even foreign interference. As much as I agree with the spirit of this post, I completely disagree with the substance - or rather, your interpretation of India.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t about _ghar wapsi_ or about Modi or, indeed, the BJP (scum though they are). This is about the creation of India as a political entity since before 1947. You see, it\\'s this bit:\\n\\n> And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?\\n\\n\\nThe Constitution is only valid so long as the people of the country choose to hold it as valid. Pieces of paper have no power or sovereignty, they derive sovereignty from the people. The people have chosen to reject the constitution, because here\\'s the kicker - the constitution and India are, and have always been, an inherently instable construct. The ideas of a secular India has always been deeply antithetical precisely because India is _not_ a nation by any rational definition of a nation. India is a hastily cobbled-together post-colonial creation that validates itself solely by creating an enemy - first the British Empire (justifiably so) and then Pakistan (unjustifiable) and Bangladesh (horrendously cruel).\\n\\nIt is these chickens that are, today, coming home to roost, because India\\'s latent Hindutva was incredible easy to exploit. It always existed, it just lacked someone to point it out. And now that people are told that their Hindutva is threatened, the only justification they have always given themselves for the existence of their nation is collapsing, and they will shred the institutions meant to keep democracy safe just to keep their Hindu project safe.\\n\\nIndia should never happened - the country was a post-colonial error, Britain\\'s final kick to south Asia, and pretending it could ever be a secular country was a mistake. Secular nations are built on tangible cultures and cultural beliefs with concrete identities, like European nations, or Indian states. India was always Hindutva, and Hindutva was always India - all it lacked was the spark to set fire to the hatred and xenophobia that always existed, because that hatred is what justifies India\\'s existence.\\n\\nTear the Republic down and demand statehood for your state, which is currently subjugated by India and Indianness. Sovereignty derives from a mandate of people living in consensus, and India will never have consensus that isn\\'t phony and manufactured. That is the only way you can guarantee a better future for those not particularly religiously inclined. The idea of a Nation is based on commonality of language&culture. We preach \"Unity in Diversity\" and at the same time we also preach others to be \"Indian First\". These 2 messages are contradictory, why do we have to forgo our cultural identities to be an \"Indian\" if being Indian is just embracing the diversity?   Therein lies the ***real*** problem, the so called National Politics is stuck in a time capsule of North Centric Post-Partition Hindu-Muslim conflict. There is no nuance or logic to this narrative, BJP considers Hindu Nation as a foregone conclusion based on Partition whereas the other side doesn\\'t have any retort other than \"let\\'s not be a Hindu Pakistan\".\\n\\nLiberals have lost the ideological battle because they\\'re living in their own little worlds where they imagine India to be something its not. Majority of Indians don\\'t give a damn about Progressive liberal beliefs and are drawn towards Charismatic leaders who talk in platitudes. What is the alternative to Modi? RAGA? Secularism is a noble State policy but it cannot be the only basis for a Nation. The ONLY ideological challenge Hindutva currently faces is Nativism from states such as Tamil Nadu&Bengal. Assamese opposition to CAB is also the same phenomenon, Assamese speakers have fallen below 50% in their own state and they don\\'t want to fall any lower than that. \\n\\n>Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution\\n\\nLiberals have spent the better part of 70+ years deconstructing and pointing out all the flaws of Hinduism but have done little to no attempt at highlighting the GOOD aspects of Hinduism to create a positive liberal Hindu identity. BJP has exploited this Hindu Identity vacuum by claiming that they understand&respect the good aspects of Hinduism,  people who would\\'ve sided with Liberals now side with BJP because they \"respect\" Hinduism, however superficial it may be. You should read [this article](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/jyzFxtxjd2iGQPqA3mgOfN/Narendra-Modi-and-the-mystery-of-the-Hindu-Left.html) for more details. \\n\\n>Islamophobia\\n\\nYou\\'re playing right into BJP\\'s hands by using this term. BJP can&will use an UNO reverse card and label you as HinduPhobic.  **BottomLine:**You CANNOT defeat Hindu Identity politics by appealing to secularism&constitution ad nauseam.  You have to create a political Liberal Hindu identity in opposition to their bigoted one and market it to the masses. That is the only way i can see Hindutva going down. In summary:\\n\\n1. BJP wants to change India into Hindu Rashtra\\n2. Muslims, Christians, Dalits and people who take the Constitution and secularism seriously will oppose that\\n3. Hence the BJP is hiding its intentions now; it has to change people\\'s perceptions to normalize Hindutva even more than it is normalized currently\\n4. So how does it justify its fascism? By creating the conditions necessary for its justification\\n5. Muslims protesting in the streets will be portrayed as \\'Pakistanis\\' or \\'jihadis\\' who want India to become an Islamic state\\n6. Students will be seen as supporting Pakistan and jihadis, hence anti-nationals; they want to break India into pieces\\n7. Intellectuals are anti-nationals and urban Naxals, maybe even supporting China\\n8. Slurs such as these were merely slurs, not to be taken seriously, but now they\\'ll become actual accusations (with perhaps legal, or extra-legal, consequences)\\n9. A conflict with Pakistan, or a very tangible fear of one, will help these slurs become real accusations\\n10. Thus BJP can justify further fascist policies like detention centres (which they deny now), and even unthinkable ones', ' Richa Dubey\\'s profession--running an online retail business that connects artisans with consumers--may not appear unusual for a modern Indian woman, but newly released data indicate just how much women lag men.\\n\\n---\\n\\n> * No more than 14% of business establishments in India are run by female entrepreneurs, according to the Sixth Economic Census by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).\\n\\n> * A native of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Dubey, 36, runs her business from Bengaluru, a city that has developed a startup ecosystem that offers women substantial independence to give their ideas wing.\\n\\n> * Dubeys company, with a team of sixmanaging administration and logisticsfalls under the 83.19% of establishments that have at least one hired worker, indicating that most businesses run by women are small-scale.\\n\\n> * Richa Dubey, 36, is one of Indias 8 million female entrepreneurs, running an online retail venture that connects artisans with consumers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are some other news items:^credits ^to ^u-sr33\\n\\n> * [Women run 14% of Indian businesses, most of them self-financed](http://scroll.in/article/807739/women-run-14-of-indian-businesses-most-of-them-self-financed)\\n\\n> * [Why India Has World s Most Stillborn Babies](http://businessworld.in/article/Why-India-Has-World-s-Most-Stillborn-Babies/05-02-2016-90895)\\n\\n---\\n\\n^I\\'m ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^\"delete\" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme', ' Faith in Government increased .\\n\\nI did not say the *current*.', \" livemint.com\\n\\nmoneycontrol.com I'd recommend [MoneyControl](http://www.moneycontrol.com/)\\nAlso, [Reuters](http://in.reuters.com/finance) has some good articles\", \" Unitech, HDIL... many more.\\n\\nIndiabulls will soon be in soup, if SC ordered investigation finds dirt.\\n\\nAn SME owner will have to provide his neighbour's Kundali also for a loan.

IMO GST is the single biggest reason behind the current economic slowdown. And what you have listed is one of the biggest reasons. Somehow the taxation and MCA rquirements have increased manifold under the Modi regime but they are not being called out in the newspapers anywhere. The left is busy labelling Modi whatnot but they arent willing to go into the details of what is actually wrong.\\n\\nThe problem is that the congress/left started out by calling Modi suit-boot ki sarkar. Now they cant even turn on their blame because in reality Modi government is all about more effective taxation as much as possible. ALL of the Modi govt initiatives - Demo, increased MCA compliance, GST, angel tax results in more and more taxation - what they dont get is that in the process of making taxation more effective they have dramatically increased compliance costs for most businessmen and this is negatively impact the economy. \\n\\nModi govt is actually more leftists than the left would like to admit. And because Modi is doing these leftish shenanigans, the left is reduced to calling him names rather than criticise him on policy and specifics. I don\\'t understand GST that well, but I used to run a company in the past (pre and post GST era). It\\'s still running, but I\\'ve moved on. \\n\\nWhenever we had an out-of-state client, we used to raise an invoice with IGST, as opposed to CGST/SGST split for in-state clients. \\n\\nWouldn\\'t that simplify the invoicing?\\n\\nLike, the head branch of Tata Motors in Mumbai raising a single invoice with IGST to the head branch of Pepperfry in Delhi? \\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, I might have got this totally wrong, as I don\\'t completely understand how GST works with large organizations operating in multiple states working with several vendors spread all over the country. Looks like an excellent saturday read. \\nThanks you very my good sir. Will go thru it later.

Reddit works because each thread is about one topic (roughly put), and it attracts those who are interested in discussing that particular subject. \\n\\n- Instead of collecting everything in one single thread, I\\'d rather that the mods split them by topics into separate threads. \\n\\n- Personally, I feel the \"community policing\" model of reddit in general is failing because of vote manipulation by vested interests. (This initiative is a good example for this). \\n\\n- As such, I feel the mods here should be bolder - don\\'t just help with the policing of the community but be more active contributors by becoming editors (or nominate or elect members from the community to be \"editors\").\\n\\n- The task of of the \"editor\" should be as it is in any modern publication or media outlet - sift though the 100\\'s or thousands of moderated content submitted everyday and highlight content that the r/india community should be more aware of, discuss and debate. \\n\\n- For this, the mods shouldn\\'t be afraid to have more than 2 sticky threads on the front page.

Corruption - Only Mamata bhakths believe that she and her party members had nothing to do with the Sarada scam. Or the other chit funds. The cases are still pending and the money is totally gone. Whatever money was returned to the few was taken out from the state funds. A bridge collapsed in the middle of city and tmc government didn\\'t bat an eye. Trifala scam has started again. There\\'s too many to list here, but do check what Abhishek Banerjee has been doing for the last few years. \\n\\n\\n2. Intolerance - Calling students Maoists and arresting them. Arresting professors and putting them behind bars without fair trial for posting a simple meme. Police violence in JU. Torturing civil service officers to suicide. \\n\\n\\n3. Lies and Jumla - park street rape case. The accused escaped and his gf who aided his escape was taken into the party. Mamata assassinated the character of the rape victim just to give a clean chit to the accused. Everyone forgot that it seems. In this regard, care to elaborate what\\'s she\\'s doing with the covid 19 testing to hide the numbers? Social media is rife with tells of how people are being turned away from hospitals, and that\\'s not bjp propaganda. I\\'m receiving news from my friends who are doctors that there\\'s state sponsored propaganda to hide the numbers. Mamata even went as far to forcefully audit the deaths to co-morbid conditions so that the covid report can be suppressed. Funny thing is, unless there\\'s co-morbid conditions, you\\'ll not even die from covid, that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not spreading.\\n\\n\\n4. Industrial output - pray tell what Mamata has done to improve the state\\'s industrial output? Where are the jobs? We\\'ve all been hearing the empty lies from the biswa bangla summit, how many of the those projects ever came to fruition?\\n\\n\\n5. Minority appeasement - while Modi is trying to get rid of muslims, Mamata is doing the opposite, going as far as to ignore the criminal elements in the society to pander to that votebank. The attack on doctors that sparked a protest across the country was fueled by the simple fact that Mamata didn\\'t have the guts to arrest the criminals because they were Muslims, even when the rational Bengali Muslim community tried denouncing them over and over. She has given the statement that those who came from Bangladesh and have voted are now citizens even if they have come recently, what the fuck? Mamata doesn\\'t get to decide who gets citizenship. We don\\'t want Bangladeshis here, no matter if they are Hindu or Muslim. Her government had even shielded war crime convicts just to get some brownie points. Why?\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s no difference between Modi and Mamata except the fact that while the first one is trying to get rid of the Muslims, the second one was trying to alleviate them to a godlike status (one imam from a Bengali masjid gave the statement a few years ago that the Muslims will decide who gets to become the CM of WB). Other than that, the lies and jumla are just as widespread, the corruption just as deep. The only reason Mamata gets away with all this is because Bengal has became irrelevant in the national stage. No one gives a shit. Else she\\'s just as corrupt and authoritarian as Modi. And if talking about the developments, these are all being done with a single strategy. Destroy Bengal\\'s industrial output, evict all the educated folks, so whoever left becomes solely dependant on the state for their livelihood. Meanwhile she and her goons can continue ruling the state like the left has done for last 3 decades. That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\n\\nBengali\\'s have no hope left. It\\'s TMC or BJP, and both are cancerous in their own ways. Only chance is for an Arvind Kejriwal to rise, but that\\'s probably never gonna happen. Most educated and literate bengali\\'s are leaving the state, who\\'s gonna rise to the occasion? There should be a trade off between socialism and Capitalism.\\n\\nSomething in between so everyone can benefit. [deleted] Nice writeup bro. \\n\\nHow’s the popularity of BJP among Bengalis ? I heard they are gaining ground in some spots and local polls . \\n\\nDo you think communists supporting the BJP will affect TMC much ? Okey let\\'s list pros and cons of Mamata and TMC\\n\\nPros: 1) Mamata is authoritarian but still TMC regime is way more free than the previous CPM rule. It was possible to openly post against TMC in social media. Such open criticism of the government or party was impossible for most people earlier.\\n\\n2) Rural infrastructure is developed a lot in comparison to previous regime. Roads are improved a lot.\\n\\n3) The police and the government offices are more active.\\n\\n4) Smaller crimes like eve teasing and theft are reduced in my experience.\\n\\n5) The government and the party is secular and not racist  at all which is a big plus point in todays India.\\n\\n6) Economy of the state is improved.\\n\\n7) Government officials and police has more power than the previous regime where they were puppets of the local party office.\\n\\nCons: 1) One woman party and government. Due to her tendency to control everything her government is full with people who are good for nothing and totally useless. She doesn\\'t like people who would argue with her.\\n\\n2) Her intolerance against opposition.\\n\\n3) TMC is full with goons and politicians whose sole aim is to make money by hook or crook.\\n\\n4) \"Appeasement\" of big groups of people for vote. Yes, not only Muslims, she tried to appease every groups who are united enough. The all India media do not show her \"appeasement\" of Hindu Matua people who are a big votebank. She tried to appease both Mullahs and Brahmin Pandits by offering them money. She also gave money to clubs and durga pujas.\\n\\n5) Various scams like Sharada, Trifala etc.\\n\\n6) State government employees are angry with her due to  not giving DA and other allowances at par with the central.\\n\\n7) Reduction of government employments and some questionable recruitments.\\n\\nVerdict:\\n\\nTMC is still better than Bengal BJP which is openly anti muslim, anti science, anti intellectual,pro fake news and anti- Bengali.

There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. \\n\\nThis is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. \\n\\nSecondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. \\n\\nThe problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don\\'t question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn\\'t for well staffed public services. Also, it\\'s high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.\\n\\nIf anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. \\n\\nI\\'ll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I\\'ll try to write up some new parts which you didn\\'t touch on.\\n__________________________________________________________\\n\\n**First part**\\n\\n> Slow but Steady: Western Economies\\n\\n> Accelerated Growth: East Asia\\n\\nThis is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can\\'t rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That\\'s the path of export-led manufacturing growth. \\n\\nMost people mistakenly think this is the \"East Asian\" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. \\n\\nSome people claim India can\\'t replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I\\'ll be brief on both.\\n\\nAs far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It\\'s just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called \"auxiliary services\". They don\\'t get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren\\'t nearly as bad as it\\'s made out to be.\\n\\nAs for trade/protectionism is concerned, it\\'s true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn\\'t really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven\\'t been able to crack the apparels segment.\\n\\nOur largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. \\n\\nIn footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  \\n\\n> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. \\n\\nSemantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  \\n\\nUsing such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  \\n\\nThe fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  \\nMeaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  \\n\\nAs for the point on why India has under-performed.  \\n\\nThe fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  \\n\\nThings like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  \\nThis a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  \\nThen at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  \\n\\nEverything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  \\n\\nIts no wonder things wouldn\\'t be smooth sailing. \\n\\nAnd about What India needs.  \\nI am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  \\n\\nHelping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   \\n\\nCurrently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   \\n\\nCurrently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30\\'s.  \\nTo me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.\\n\\nIndustrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.\\n\\n* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn\\'t want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.\\n\\n* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.\\n\\n* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don\\'t work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. \\n\\n This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I\\'ve been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. \\n\\nIt\\'s disheartening that the comments don\\'t have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it\\'s population in farming and yet it\\'s very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. \\n\\nManufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.\\n\\nAs far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don\\'t think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don\\'t want to work.  ', ' [deleted] When did TOI got spine?

Good luck. It\\'s Dr Manmohan Singh, not Mr. 😒 Are you from the same constituency as narendra ? Since you want a logical answer here it goes. \\n\\nIndia is a massive country which makes slow and steady progress. We move slowly and that is because we have a lot of inertia. But once we start moving, it is difficult to stop us. We didn\\'t move our asses for close to 2 centuries to send off the Brits, but once we got together, it didn\\'t take too long. This characteristic of ours carries on and is seen in our parliament. Bills take too long to go through and there is opposition from every group (logical because everyone has their own perspective). But once the discussions are done, implementation becomes easy. \\n\\nAnd this tardiness is hated by our generation. We need things to move fast and lack patience. So when we saw UPA going slow with the bills and everything, the hope of a strong leader who can hasten things was sold to people. And we lapped it up. However, we forgot that Indian politics runs on fake promises. We were given images of Gujarat\\'s development, but few even bothered to check whether Modi was the guy who did it. (Fun fact: He wasn\\'t). Thus, our newfound hope, Modi become the PM who would deliver us unto the New India. Nobody paid attention to the 2002 riots or maybe they thought he would have learnt from his mistakes. But lest we forget, it is the RSS that holds the reins now. \\n\\n\\nI am okay with you if you voted for him in 2014. If you did vote for him in 2019, you better get off your arse and protest like there is no tomorrow for you fell for the rhetoric of patriotism.\\n\\nEdit: Congress can do whatever the fuck they want (like sticking with Pappu). Similarly, you can do whatever the fuck you want. You can go protest or spread the truth about this government or work for the development of the society. The choice is yours. Even an Ape is better than Modi as the PM as long it doesn\\'t make the citizens kill each other. How about Shashi tharoor? Rahul Gandhi is not a retard. Narendra Modi\\'s problem is not that he is a narcissist. His problem is that he is a terrorist. Anyone is better that Modi. Especially Rahul. He would actually listen to others such as MMS. People who voted for modi for the second time are the worst. I would give the first time a pass because he was promising development. The second time only thing he promised was this and that\\'s why they are the worst. They knew what he stood for they knew how crooked and dumb he was rafale, demo etc all happened the first term. They only way these people could get worse is saying stuff like Rahul is bad. You guys choose modi after you knew what he did and what he was capable of. Everybody knew this was going to happen especially in 2019. Everybody knows what the rss is. Everyone knew about the 2002 riots. And everyone knew all the bs about Rahul  was just pr. And you believed all that and still do. His quote \"History will be kinder to me than the contemporary media and the opposition parties in parliament\" has never been so damn true. Let\\'s be realistic. He is very old. There are many talented people in congress too. I sincerely hope tharoor\\'s rebel against gandhi family succeed. Not that Rahul gandhi is all bad. But BJP has made his such image so that it is very unlikely for public to support him over few years. He should accept it and keep low profile for few years. Voting for Modi in 2014 is forgivable but not in 2019. If you voted in 2014, then you should be fine. Koi lautaa de mere beete hue din ! Btw Manmohan Singh\\'s term was the highest on corruption.

Cigarettes are 45 a piece here. Can't afford groceries if the lockdown goes on for another month. Sure, suggest us to buy cheap properties. Fucking real estate assholes. To a hammer,every problem looks like it can be fixed by a nail. Fact of the matter is real estate is a bad investment in India. You may buy a house if you wish to live in it. However as an investment vehicle with pitiful rental yields of 2-3% due to over supply in most cities, it is a renter's market.\\n\\nBuying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate.

Post corona,  the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon. Most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities. There will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour. \\n\\nSo expect massive delays on projects that are under construction . \\n\\n\\nA large number of real estate firms will wind up. Quite a few will be stuck in litigation . You money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset. \\n\\n\\nWe are going through a highly irregular time.

Look how the CCP is protesting now saying that India\\'s protections violate the WTO rules.

You cannot even get a Diwali lamp that\\'s made in India these days, and it is because local makers cannot compete with the state subsidized manufacturing and dumping by China. \\n\\nHonestly, if a startup is really good, money will flow in from everywhere. Companies like Paytm are not real innovations. They are data mining operations. Great startups have marquee investors from US, Singapore, Korea etc. We don\\'t need China. \\n\\n\\nThey have taken over companies all across EU and Australia. They sneak in, then buy it completely. > Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket \\n\\nThese companies are hardly innovative and just do the middleman business but online. Too much VC money is not good for whole business ecosystem. These companies are subsidizing to create mono/duo-poly, and crushing down the other competing domestic startups. We don\\'t want that. \\n\\n> Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? \\n\\nHDFC is a [systemically important bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution). In short, a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis. They are colloquially referred to as \"too big to fail\". Owning every % of HDFC is like owning a part of Indian economy, So obviously Indian Govt. will loose their shit if China invest more in this company. > Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government.\\n\\nDude, what the hell are you smoking? Indian startups are mere copycats of Western businesses! Flipkart copied Amazon, Ola copied Uber, Oyo copied Airbnb, PayTM copied Paypal, Zomato copied Yelp, the list goes on!\\n\\n> 1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC.\\n\\nHDFC Ltd. is a lending company with deep ties to the banking sector. Even a 1% stake lets them get into the board, and they get veto powers. A CCP-owned firm having veto powers in one of the largest banking organizations of the country? No, thanks!\\n\\n> 2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It\\'s clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required?\\n\\nWhile I agree that the finance ministry is daft in regards to various policy matters since it is controlled by the PMO; a veto against China won\\'t kill startups. What kills startups are their lack of revenue management. Almost all startups are running in losses! How long will financers back these companies? Businesses exist to generate profit; yet most modern startups don\\'t have those plans in sight (both Indian and foreign startups as well).\\n\\n> 3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?\\n\\nWhy should government systems provide financial aid to companies, both startups as well as established businesses? That whole line of thinking is wrong in my opinion. Unfortunately, the worst precedent was set when government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Yes, businesses have been hurt by Covid-19; and a lot of them have incurred losses as well. Isn\\'t it part of running a busines? If startups don\\'t learn to not put all their eggs in one basket, the government cannot help it. The most a government can do (and I am not talking BJP / Congress here) is relax taxation and bureaucratic mess of paperwork to ease startups to get back to their feet. I don\\'t think India has banned investments. They just made it mandatory to seek government approval before its done.\\n\\nIf China is pissed they can take it up theirs.\\n\\nYou just need to look at Australia, if you want to see what giving China free rein could mean in a tough situation. What are the anti takeover laws you are talking about? Do you have an example of any country implementing it successfully? \\n\\nNot in a harsh tone, just curious. I do not understand why everyone thinks they are financial experts and the people running the country with advisors who are some of the best experts in their fields are all idiots.\\n\\nAs for answering your question, you have to think bigger and broader than just startups, as an effect of coronavirus there is going to be a recession and most industries would be going into red, so as to avoid hostile takeovers and keep the industries safe the decision was taken.\\n\\nYou should open your mentality a little broader and read about what China has done in Maldives and how much debt Maldives is in right now. You can also Google about what China is doing in Africa.\\n\\nInstead of appreciating when the country actually takes steps to protect its national interests and assets here you are deriding it and favouring China.

There is the core RSS votebank, the Modi votebank, the development votebank, a newly minted SC/ST/OBC votebank and so on. The development votebank is fast disappearing, true. And probably turning into an anti Modi votebank. But the rest are new, believers in **what Modi has been doing since 2014** and they remain steadfast.\\n\\nEnd of the day, the total anti BJP voter share in India is higher than BJP\\'s vote share, all put together. But there is no one to bring those votes all across India against BJP. There is no leadership, no unity, no clear strategy. I like your optimism The fundamental truth that I have learned about Indian politics is that it is dependent not on ideology, policy or party allegiance but largely on cult of personality. We have had people like Bal Thackeray who was never elected to any position but controlled the politics of one of the largest states and one of the most important cities of the country for decades. Gandhi\\'s,  Jaya Lalitha, MSG, Mamta Banerjee the list goes on and on. \\n\\nModi has created a cult of personality for himself that even opposition candidates are fearful of attacking him directly (rather than trading barbs with Amit Shah or BJP MLA\\'s). Until an opposition party with cross national muscle has a leadership figure who can cultivate a cult of personality around himself to oppose Modi, there will be no real power vacuum at the national level.\\n\\nCongress is dead behind Rahul Gandhi, no other opposition party has a nationally relevant figure. Future I could see is with AAP/Kejriwal who has moulded himself into the archetype of middle-class Indian man, but AAP have years if not decades of work ahead of them to build a national party rather than a regional one. Lauda kuch nahi hone wala. This country is full of chutiyas. BJP will win again at the national level because Congress has shat the bed.

On a scale of 1-21, we rank 16th, while arch-rival India ranks 9th.\\n\\n>In the latest review, Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s outlook to positive, which simply means that the country’s economy is moving in a positive direction. But it didn’t increase Pakistan’s credit rating, which remains at B3 – \\xa0the level it has been maintaining since June, 2015.\\n>India, on the other hand, stands at Baa2 or seven notches better than Pakistan on Moody’s scale.\\n\\nhttps://www.samaa.tv/money/2019/12/no-pakistans-credit-rating-is-not-better-than-indias/amp/ Actually I read an article where it was mentioned that places where some kind of political turmoil subsides and things begin to calm down, there is a sudden increase in foreign investment opportunities. The example of Egypt was given in the article, that right after Arab Spring or Hossini Mubarak was voted out and the coupe and after all that, Egypt became very lucrative for foreign investment. Pakistani here, been following our economy closely so may be able to shed more light on this.\\n\\nMoody is not saying that Pakistan is a better place to invest than India or that Pakistan's economy is better than India's right now. \\n\\nWhat it is saying is that its outlook for Pakistan is positive while its outlook for India is negative. This means that, according to their assessment, India's economy will be worse than it is right now in the future while Pakistan's will be better than it is right now\\n\\nHow is Pakistan doing this? Pakistan has had some strict policies, which the general population is hating because all imported goods are now much more expensive, life is harder for us right now. However, through this policy Pakistan has drastically lowered exports, which has 'improved' our trade deficit. \\n\\nPakistan's current government has many similar policies which are targeting macroeconomic indicators to strengthen the economy. Our previous government was artificially inflating the rupee (the rate was around 100pkr per USD) by selling its dollar reserves and buying rupees. The current government stopped doing this and let the rupee reach its actual value. The rupee went from 100 to 150 per USD in the matter of a few months, but it is now stable and slowly starting to improve\\n\\nOn the other hand, Indian government is doing stuff like demonetization and fudging economic numbers to make itself look good. Moody basically looked at the way both countries are being run and assessed that Pakistan is improving because they are willing to take hard decisions to improve the economy, while India is, uh, doing other things Investors in Pakistan having a blast Kashmir masterstroke coming home to roost. \\n\\nMost Indians don’t realize what a Pandora’s box that has opened up. \\n\\nWhen the MEA says that the greatest defense obstacle for India’s progress is its unresolved borders that bloat the armed forces, and then the same government unilaterally decides to massively change the status quo without taking into account external threats, and ends up making it so that now China claims all of Ladakh(South-Tibet) and is constantly upping the ante on neighboring countries like Nepal to take up border issues with India, not to mention the uptick in incursions in the North East.\\n\\nSo now India is bleeding resources on self inflicted wounds while the adversary gets to sit back, focus on building internal strength, and cry foul about the human rights violations that tarnish India’s image and economic desirability. \\n\\nIndians can act like the repeated bashing’s in premier western publications are worthless but all these add up to form public and investor perception, this will have long term consequences and they are already coming to fruition.

Internship is still a loophole Question: Do the employers actually pay such minimum wages? Not just Delhi, in any place. India has minimum wage? It is a good step. Although many unskilled workers' work is not documented and is paid whatever the employer feels like one would agree to work on. \\n\\nCurrently, in NCT Delhi daily wage worker/ contract based/ dihadi majdoor / construction labors are paid around 300 rs /day for 10 hrs of work. \\n\\nSo not much is changed however what has been done is commendable. Curious - how much merit is there to concerns of labour intensive businesses migrating to other states? This sounds good on paper. But **it is a good step if and only if the government has factored in whether the business industry can afford the additional cost.** This is why it is important to talk to the industry too. Otherwise, the industries will just move their factories to other states causing a huge job loss in Delhi. And the businesses who remain will be forced to increase their price to be in business making everything for the consumers in Delhi costlier. \\n\\nThis will probably end up as a costly learning experience to the inexperienced AAP government - **if you side only with the workers it's communism, and if you only support the corporates it's capitalism**. And both these models won't work in India. That is why it is important to talk to both parties to understand each others problem, and then create policies that address them.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**Edit**: As an example of considering a lot of things when making a policy - free education for all sounds like a great idea. Until you factor in the reality that you then have to create jobs for all these educated people. And you would also drive down the cost of labour with so many educated people seeking jobs. This is why education in India (and other countries) is deliberately affordable to only a certain section of society or to the exceptional (scholarships). That is why education is only free up to the level our economy can accommodate (currently at school levels, as offered in government schools). This is why it is important to talk with every stakeholder when making a policy.

The attention to the state of the Indian economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. Photo: AP\\n\\nLast week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.\\n\\nIf indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.\\n\\nBoth are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.\\n\\nThe other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.\\n\\nSo while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.\\n\\nIt is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.\\n\\nAs such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.\\n\\nThis potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.\\n\\nAlongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.\\n\\nIn a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).\\n\\nSimilarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.\\n\\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.\\n\\n“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”\\n\\nIn the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.\\n\\nThe Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.\\n\\nEven though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.\\n\\nAnil Padmanabhan is executive editor of Mint and writes every week on the intersection of politics and economics.\\n\\nHis Twitter handle is @capitalcalculus.\\n\\nRespond to this column at anil.p@livemint.com.\\n\\n ______ \\n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.', ' Bina corona ke bhi kon sa jhant ukhad lete.

The greatest trick thats been played on the common masses has been the trickle down effect.

Decrease tax rates for wealthy because it would somehow improve situation for the other 98%.\\n\\n\\nFuck this shit. I want the government to fucking care about common people instead. Make policies that benefit the 99% instead of the fucking 1% that have been increasing their share of the pie for years now. Economy is better when there is better circulation of money. The fact is that once the rich sense a weakness in the economy, they pull out. They invest elsewhere or just keep it to themselves. It leaves less for the other 99% and that\\'s what we are seeing now.\\n\\nCompanies don\\'t want to hire people because there is a lack of consumers. People are unemployed or working on much lower incomes which means they can only spend on what\\'s necessary. Youth are not going for higher education because there are no jobs to get with those higher qualifications. This is an irreversible event the effects of which will be seen for years to come.

No politics, no drama, no braggadocio, no bullshit. He wasn\\'t tainted by crises like Indira Gandhi or Nehru, either. He was all work and no talk. He singlehandedly pulled India out of the mouth of a potential economic depression in 1991 and helped set it on the right track as Prime Minister. 2004 to 2009 saw stratospheric economic growth and even 2009-2014, despite the global financial turbulence, was pretty impressive.

The attention to the state of the Indian economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. Photo: AP\\n\\nLast week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.\\n\\nIf indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.\\n\\nBoth are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.\\n\\nThe other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.\\n\\nSo while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.\\n\\nIt is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.\\n\\nAs such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.\\n\\nThis potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.\\n\\nAlongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.\\n\\nIn a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).\\n\\nSimilarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.\\n\\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.\\n\\n“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”\\n\\nIn the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.\\n\\nThe Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.\\n\\nEven though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.\\n\\nAnil Padmanabhan is executive editor of Mint and writes every week on the intersection of politics and economics.\\n\\nHis Twitter handle is @capitalcalculus.\\n\\nRespond to this column at anil.p@livemint.com.\\n\\n ______ \\n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.', \" None of this is new.

You can't counter idiots with logic. They will still support him. Yes no one is talking about it. But I've seen many documentaries about our economic condition (I'm no expert but I've heard what experts been saying). This bubble was building up by the time of Congress but Manmohan was very smart. True that loans were high in that time too. But when you are in economic boom you're supposed to give loans to companies and take calculated risk. But now the loans are about 5-6 time higher, unemployment is 45 years high, bad loans have gone 3 to 9%. The bubble have been burst.

Ghanta bajaao\", ' >Also,why is India still a developing nation when our history is longer than say,the USA?(as far as my knowledge goes,which isn\\'t much)\\n\\nDid you miss 150 years of colonism which existed till 1947?\\n\\nIndia, as an independent nation and a free economy has existed only for 70ish years. \\n\\nOur economic policies have also been flawed for a large party of our history. Idealism, corruption and incorrect policies had pretty much shackled the economy until 1990.\\n\\nDespite liberalising the economy later, we still had massive growths from 1990s onwards (the quality of the growth is whole another matter) The mentality is bad. Agreed. \\nDevelopment of a country is based on industrialization, income per capita, GDP, literacy and other such aspects, not history. So even though we have  a richer history, we lack in every other aspect. This is an Asian problem not an \"Indian\" problem, this is because our opinions are heavily influenced by our parents and the older you become the more conservative you get so your children too are conservative. I think many people in india have this kind of ultra conservative mentality because of our education system, in short, it makes people rote learn rather teaching them to think critically.\\n\\nAlso, in india still has low literacy rate of about 74% as of 2011 census. In 2011 census population of India was 1.21 billion(121 crore), so we have about 300 million(30 crore) people who are illitrate in 2011, so the number illitrate people in india in 2011 is almost equal to the entire population of USA.\\n\\nIndia still remains as developing country even after more than 70 years of independence can be blamed to bad govt policies, corruption, the mentality of people and the worst one being population explosion. \\n\\nTo get an idea how insanely fast population of India increased : In 1951 census the population of India was 361 million(36.1 crore), in 1961, it was 439 million(43.9 crore), 1971 it was 548 million(54.8 crore), in 1981, it was 683 million(63.8 crore), in 1991 it was 846 million(84.6 crore), 2001, it was 1029 million(102.9 crore), in 2011, it was 1210 million(121 crore). Presently, 2019 it is about 1370 million(137 crore).\\n\\nSo since independence we have added about 1 billion people to this country. So we need a lot of resources just to sustain the existing population. Now to add insult to the injury, we also had, many bad govt policies, corrupt politicians, who only look for their personal gains, rather than focusing on the development of the nation.

It\\'s a huge loss to the public exchequer , most of the lent funds will never be recovered . It was a beautiful track. But an expensive sport like F1 isn\\'t designed for India. Even Azerbaijan and Mexico struggle despite drawing good crowds. Maybe a few years down the line. Although I don\\'t see F1 surviving the end of conventional fuel era for that long. \"GP2 government... GP2 government. Aaargh!\" This track and other mega infrastructure projects like it are a testament to our quashed hopes and dreams as a nation. When I graduated from school in 2006, we all really did think that India would be a great and prosperous nation in 20 years.\\n\\nAnd yet here we are! Idiotic waste of government money. None of the teams liked the track and perennially complained of pathetic conditions around the track. All this so a few rich folks could drive around their expensive imported cars. Bit of a waste of money IMO.', ' What are you morning walk enthusiasts and runners planning to do once the lockdown is relaxed? Also no mention seems to be about construction industry.

What\\'s missing? Hey you could open your channel and let the viewers donate. Many people are doing this independent journalism. Like Faye D Souza who just opened her channel after being fired(or she just quit?). Look for these channels as well Kumar Shyam, Aam Press Tv. Get you own channel Try newslaundry I’m no expert, but maybe try writing your own articles, opinion pieces etc. and use free platforms like YouTube n such. Or offer them to local newspapers and magazines. Once you’ve got sufficient ‘by lines’ you could apply to bigger publications. There is a great dearth of good, well researched and independent journalists in India. Most of them now are pushing some agenda or ideology. Print journalism may still have some integrity but electronic media is a cesspool. Before even switching on the television, most of us can predict the spin each channel will put on a certain event. \\n\\nJournalists are much needed for this country. The battlefield of the 21nd Century is going to be information and attention with you people being the force multipliers of the arena. Though you are struggling now and have stumbled, don\\'t falter.  Good luck OP! Find your niche and everything shall follow. Do not feel disappointed. Try getting in touch Newslaundry? Apna business khol do didi. Digital content marketing aur baaki sab. Write your own article and slowly build up your website. Best of luck. write a book. anything that\\'s stopping you from doing that? as in the beat that you cover is not popular etc? I agree with most of the opinions here: if you aren\\'t in bad place financially, start your own channel/blog, and publicise the hell out of it on FB/Reddit/IG whatever. It doesn\\'t require a lot of initial investment (financially atleast), and you\\'d also be adding worthwhile experience to your portfolio, further making you an attractive candidate later down the line.\\n\\nIf you need any help setting up something, you only need ask! You have it in you already, you just need to go ahead and give it your best shot.\\n\\nYou can do it OP; we all believe in you! :-) Happens. Do introspection. Figure out what is missing. Work on small small things > Guess, I am just tired of getting rejected\\n\\nNo one has the authority or power to reject you. You allow others to do so. So, there is no point in getting tired or feel bad. Rather, I see such \\'rejections\\' as a difference of opinion, thats it..\\n\\nJournalism, in the age of digital, is one of the most exciting things to do. Keep expressing your views, via words, videos, images, and choose a platform to do so. Facebook, Twitter, Youtube are the current hot favourites, and if you are consistent, the right eyes will see you, the right ears will hear you. \\n\\n7 years of experience doesnt matter in this dynamic industry.. Your voice, your persistence, and your unique angle of viewing things does.\\n\\nAll the best! Have you tried Zee News? Maybe your writing sucks ? OP, the market is currently fucked.\\n\\nThe options that are available aren\\'t really lucrative and the options you want aren\\'t going to become abundantly available anytime soon. Brace yourself for a long \\'winter\\'.\\n\\nI\\'m gonna make a few assumptions about you in this response and I apologise if any of them are wrong.\\n\\nBeing a journo in these trying times is a difficult gig for several reasons. Traditional media has frozen/slowed hiring because they are not sure their existing ways and methods will survive. New media requires an additional skillset that not many traditional journos readily have. Companies are looking to hire hybrids - candidates who can seamlessly switch between traditional and new media. You might want to consider re-skilling or upskilling yourself with a certificate/course from somewhere reputed.\\n\\nThis is above and beyond the fact that some places are just shit to work at - you know the one\\'s I\\'m talking about. Most middle management in media is either incompetent idiots or assholes on a power trip.\\n\\nThat leaves you with independent journalism, which is way more difficult that most people believe it is.  Any idiot can put up a YouTube video (and most idiots do) but good, proper journos will agonize over every little detail and end up not posting anything. Independent journalism is a difficult, uphill climb but the view from the top is worth it.\\n\\nMy recommendation would be hit up your contacts from your job days and pitch them specific stories/ideas/solutions pertinent to their brand. Design your pitch such that it plays to your strengths and their needs. You\\'ll get probably one meeting every ten pitches and your first okay after ten meetings. Be prepared for that.\\n\\nAlternatively, you might want to do a John Galt (not a great example) and work in something completely unrelated.  This will help you in two ways - one, it\\'ll help you earn some money, and two, it will give you the option of getting away from it all for a short while.\\n\\nGood luck, OP. I   would   like   to  suggest   that   you   think   long   and   hard   about   how   much   effort   you\\'ve   put   into   your   career   versus   how   much   more   it   has   to   offer.   The   reason   being   I   have   a   friend   who   is   trained   with   two   relevant   degrees   and   a   masters   in   their   field   also   who   seems   to   be   struggling   to   find   regular   sustainable   work.    \\n\\nIt   might   be   that   unless   something   \"dream   job\"   worthy   came   along   you   will   need   to   work   part   time   in   your   field   and   supplement   it   another   way.\\n\\nI   wish   you   good   luck.', \" I am using hotstar. Though I am not sure hotstar works outside India(I checked last year). If you want to catch news, I think there are live feeds on YouTube of news channels.

I mean howdo you high tarriffs on Tesla and other Electric Vehicles with the lofty claims made by ministers ? Do we even have the infrastructure to support electric cars? Yahan road hai nahi.... RumTum Tesla ki baat kar raberahe ho It's not just import duties. I drive a Tesla. This car won't survive in Indian conditions without heavy modifications. The clearance is too low, the materials and paint too susceptible to the constant battering Indian roads provide, etc.\\n\\nThe core issue remain that they're expensive and this will be just another luxury vehicle that won't sell because the country simply doesn't have the infrastructure to support EVs. Anything that is environment friendly should have no import duties! Then don't import and build it in India. Why is the deer not working lmao? They are high cuz govt don’t wanna import them. Make them here China is far ahead of us in electronics manufacturing. Opening the door to imported EVs now would mean killing off the domestic auto industry and ushering in Chinese imports. Further, these EVs are not going to be powered by renewables, they are going to be powered my electricity which is produced in India by burning coal, which is worse than Petrol vehicles, so there is no real environmental benefit in switching to EVs today.\\n\\nWe need to make our electricity grid less dependent on coal and while doing so simultaneously get the infrastructure ready to produce EVs domestically in India so that they are at least somewhat competitive compared to imports, and only then push for their adoption. This means that there needs to be a phased adoption plan which industries can depend on to decide their investments and production targets. \\n\\nAllowing Teslas here today at no import duty does not really make any sense. Electric vehicles and super cars needs better infrastructure which is only seen near airports. If a normal consumer has pot holes and water logging on his street then he won't be encouraged to buy such vehicles. Surprise, let me guess so are taxes and having to pay a wage to workers.

Result: Sharmaji ended up in the hospital the next day with several broken ribs and fingers. After some months he returned to his job but never again touched a child.

I can\\'t professionally move up for another year or so, so I\\'ve entered into relevant courses, started diving and learning new things.\\n\\nAs time goes on you\\'ll see the similarities in how you feel and how everyone else acts, everyone is doing the same thing. Just be trying. Most parents think that millennials are dumb and are taking our nation to shit due to their smartphone and pubg addiction. But in reality it\\'s the politicians voted by everyone including older generation. Tell him it\\'s his genetics , all the overachievers usually have intelligent parents .... This will really piss him off I\\'m 24. I can\\'t drive. I haven\\'t even bothered to learn to cycle. You have all your life. Screw that shit. 19 is not even that old. You\\'ve technically not even started adult life. I\\'m 28. Bought my first car this year. Can\\'t drive. Hate all sports. The idea of going to the gym makes me wanna cry. I’m 30 and broke Same here.\\n\\n\"When we were your age, we already had you. When we were your age, we had built a house of our own. When we were your age, we had a stable job. When we were your age...\", when you were my age, the country wasn\\'t going to the dogs. When you were my age, the country wasn\\'t going to run out of water in the next 5 years. When you were my age, things weren\\'t as politically fragile as they are today. When you were my age, the economy hadn\\'t collapsed from top to bottom. When you were my age a huge, unemployed youth population wasn\\'t out either protesting for more jobs or slitting each-other\\'s throats for one. Your time was different. Accept it and move on. I am from pakistan and faced same issue. I am 29 now and after finishing bachelors(8 years ago) I had hard time getting job like everyone else. My father used to mock me each and everyday that you are a failure and you will never achieve shit in your life. He used to say so by comparing me with one neighbor guy who got a good job as a developer. I had skills and did job which I quit after 6 months because my boss was a dick. I had been full time freelancer soon after my studies and when I started earning more than that “developer neighbor” then all the mockery stopped all of a sudden and I became their most faithful and successful son. I am currently doing my dream job outside country and living in company’s provided apparent with family. I will never forget those mockeries and will never have respect for my father which I wish I could have I sought my father\\'s approval for the first 24 years of my life. In the last 6 months, I\\'ve been depressed and suicidal due to feeling like there was no hope for happiness in my future. \\n\\nI realised any father who put his daughter in a position to choose between her own happiness and pleasing him, is not a good parent.\\n\\nStopped giving a fuck about his approval. Took a lot of time and therapy. But it worked. Against his desires, I moved out of the country to find a future for myself and I\\'m struggling financially. I struggle for food. But I\\'m happier than I\\'ve ever been in all my life. \\n\\nSeeking validation and approval lead to no where. There will always be someone brighter, better and wealthier than you that people will compare you to. They will never be proud of what you\\'ve achieved and they don\\'t need to. You need to be happy with yourself. And honestly that has changed my life. I never thought I could be that person.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m 25 and know how to drive because I got my license but never drive a car because im not confident. 19M, with a drop year (in the first year itself). Under average in studies. Physically ugly. Virgin, never kissed or hugged. Had girlfriend for 1.5years and turns out it was one sided from my side. Can\\'t drive car but I can ride Activa. Have a really supportive bestfriend but I don\\'t treat her right. My behaviour goes toxic when anyone proves me wrong. I feel your pain. But if you\\'re willing to learn, find a  quiet place and a friend to help(if you can) and wake up early, like 4 - 5 am early and learn it. It should hardly take 6-7 days. I\\'m 21, have a job but am lazy as fuck ,very poor with my finances & afraid that I\\'m gonna end up alone First time huh? I hear that rant everyday, its to the point where it doesn\\'t even affect me, i practically live with existential crisis and top that with being an introvert, no one is perfect but our society doesn\\'t understand a simple fact that not everyone can become the top 2% in a rat race that only favours the academically superior, but we apparently can\\'t do anything do about it so just go with the flow, pretend it\\'s the rainy season of your life, it\\'ll pass and the sun will shine one day, just keep on trying I\\'m 16....got rejected by my crush day before yesterday....self esteem is pretty low...and seeing others like me on reddit makes me genuinely happy. it\\'s interesting as a Canadian of Indian immigrants seeing the youth of India questioning aspects of Indian culture.  It\\'s similar to what kids of expats went through when our parents first moved away.    \\nNot that the globe is smaller and ideas proliferate so quickly, Indian youth are going through the same cultural revolution that we dealt with.  Still one foot firmly planted in tradition while the other desperately dragging itself to a new reality  \\nI only offer the advise that stay true to yourselves.  There is merit in buying into the system, but don\\'t be defined by it.  Play music, draw pictures and do the other things that are \"frowned\" upon cuz \"ye saab se paisa nahi aiga\".   \\nI also understand better the pressures previous generations felt, and so it\\'s natural for them to push on to their kids.  Treat your parents with kindness, for they know not what they do .. they too are struggling with how the world has changed before them Bro start driving using a small automatic hatchback. It\\'s so easy to drive and also have big red \\'L\\' stickers on your car , you can remove it once you learn how to drive. Usually people understand when they see the \\'L\\' sticker and will give you way and won\\'t criticize you. Wake up at 5 am and learn to drive on empty roads first, once you get the hang of it go into usual traffic. I have seen people drive with L stickers for even upto 6-8 months. But make sure you learn to drive a car before you finish college it\\'ll be absolutely necessary. Even experienced F1 drivers would be scared shitless when they drive for the first time in Indian traffic. I screwed up and failed my car driving test and that\\'s saying something, as our country\\'s driving test is an absolute joke and is perhaps, one of the easiest tests out there, in this world of ours.\\n\\nThis happened when I was around 19 years of age (almost 5 years back). I mean, I had hopes and aspirations that I would have obtained a license asap, the moment I turned 18. Well, it sucks I suppose, for life to not turn up the way one hopes too, even if they give their darnest best to make it happen.\\n\\nI guess, my neuroticism and anxiety ruined that test for me, on that fateful day. Prior to reaching the testing grounds, my instructor made me do a trial on the roads, which I did a good job of and he assured me that I\\'ll surely pass the test as long as I maintain my cool and composure.\\n\\nBut, he couldn\\'t accompany me on the grounds and instead, another instructor who had no clue of my temperament and personality came. And he didn\\'t help things for me. For every minor mistake I made, he kept belittling me, dismissing my anxiety and nervous attitude and told me as to how I seemed to be the weakest out there, when compared to other candidates who came along with me.\\n\\nAnd thus, I was completely demoralised and failed the test. Everyone present on the ground, were laughing at me for my ineptitude in handling the vehicle. Did not speak with anyone, on that day. I\\'m 23, and I still haven\\'t learnt to drive. Just saying:  \\n\\n\\nI was afraid to drive, and have never ridden a bicycle till this summer. I got a job and was about to move to Bangalore. I knew that I had to learn it, and if I stay afraid now, I\\'ll hate myself for this in future.  \\n\\n\\nSo in a span of 2 months, I learnt how to ride a bicycle, then a scooty and a car back to back. Sometimes the motivation comes from necessity. Let me see. 23 y/o, male. \\n\\n1. cant drive any motorized vehicle.\\n2. cant dance, cant party\\n3. cant be \"social\", some dumb-fuckery by someone always flips me off\\n4. In a quest to learn as much as possible. so that makes me a prick\\n5. Dont watch movies.\\n6. Dont like eating.\\n7. Dont particularly travelling In big groups. \\n8. obsessive planner, not so much on the execution side.\\n9. One decent relationship that lasted 6 months.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nnote: i can and do ride bicycles and I do trek solo (started this recently) My dad made me drive when I was 19 ( now 21 ) and I got involved in 3 minor accidents and naturally developed a fear of driving cars. I can drive two wheelers fine but they still mock for not being able to drive a car. Honestly this is more because of a breakdown in communication than anything\\n\\nA lot of Indian parents are great at raising and talking to their kids till they\\'re 12-13 but seem to completely lose it after that\\n\\nIts important to note that you can\\'t control or govern your kids lives as they get older and that they still need unconditional help and support from their parents\\n\\nKids are too afraid of their parents to say no when they get forced into following some field or career and parents are too focused on the future to see what\\'s happening with their kids in the here and the now\\n\\n\\nThat being said the kid themselves isn\\'t blameless.. A lot of bright minded smart kids just lose the will to study/work/perform... And there is little their teachers or parents can do to understand if there is no communication.\\n\\n\\nAs for you OP... If you have a clear idea of what you wanna do in life then let your parents know about it... Let them understand that you have a goal that you\\'re working towards.. An aim that you want to achieve\\n\\nThey may be bullheaded about it but they still want the best for you.. Using my throwaway porn account because I don\\'t want my irl friends to find out about his, ever.\\n\\n20, Final year of BCA. Since I\\'m a failure (not engineer), My school friends consider me a failure and try really hard to hide that because that don\\'t want to hurt me (Or maybe I\\'m insecure, Idk)    \\n\\n* I still live with my parents, and I regret not living out on my own at least once every week.\\n* I know I\\'m not stupid (I\\'m always one of the first ones to build up logic for a program, I\\'m good at few things) but I have never achieved anything in my life, used to score \\\\~50% in schools and hence have trouble with my self image in this aspect (If I\\'m smart who just sucks at studies or if I\\'m dumb and just pretending to be smart).\\n* Current college is shitty as fuck, I have grown to hate this city because I want to live away from it.     \\n* My dressing sense sucks, but I try to mask it with an \"I don\\'t care what I wear\" attitude     \\n* I\\'m supposed to be preparing for MCA, which, if done from good college, Is the only way I can start earning. I have studied nothing in last 5 days, And my MCA entrance is 3 months away. I had told my Pune friends that I\\'ll be visiting them around 18th of December, but now I\\'m having second thoughts because of not studying. I\\'m not prepared at all for this, I feel like I\\'m gonna be a fuckup. and the worst part of this is I\\'m not even trying to change things.\\n* I have a gaming problem, when I\\'m left with games, I stop prioritizing things, and play it till everything else is collapsed... Last time I spiraled out on my gaming thing, I ended up scoring really bad for my 12th exams (Hence didn\\'t take engineering)  \\n* I\\'m really self critical, self conscious and a self loather (Not proud of it). There is something wrong with me, psychologically, But I don\\'t know what. Parents won\\'t understand what therapy is (Typical \"you\\'re not crazy, try going out more\" mentality, I don\\'t blame them for it). I have planned to get therapy with my own money once I start earning, Which won\\'t be anytime soon.\\n* I know I won\\'t do it. but I passively think that if I don\\'t settle down by 25 (or atleast start to settle down), I will kill myself  (Again, I won\\'t do it. I have felt suicidal twice in my life, and didn\\'t even try to harm myself those two times.)\\n\\nI don\\'t even know why I\\'m posting this here, I guess I just need to vent. 19 , Didn\\'t get into IIT even after taking drop, have zero friends and no accomplishments, Never had a GF , total waste of parents money Dude that pressure will always be there, irrespective of your age. Today it is abt your studies, tommorow it will be abt job, then about marriage and kids. \\nI stood up to my dad only after engineering, i finally got the balls to say that i want to do business and not want to work in a MNC.\\nHe listened to me for the first time after that full blown argument.\\nNow he encourages(read pressure) me to expand my business 😅 Turned 22 today, absolutely no direction in life. Have no idea what I really like doing. Most of us deal with this on a daily basis, correct me if I’m wrong. We could all use a hug right now. \\nBut only thing that keeps me going is no matter how hard or shitty a day gets, it doesn’t last more than 24 hours. I feel slightly better knowing that. Hopefully this changes the way you perceive things. Well I\\'m a teacher wage about 3000 RS per month 22 year old, lazy but hard working , have a dream of becoming an scientist or programmer but dream crushed by the same people The comparisons to other people of your age is normal and everyone has faced this in their life. Note that, I am saying everyone has faced this doesn\\'t mean that it is right and in the contrary, it is detrimental on the mindset of how we are brought up. The fact is that after our parents do this comparison, some people don\\'t give a damn after a certain age but some people still end up comapring themselves with their peers. \\n\\nYep, nobody is perfect but we have to do something meaningful in the world to earn our living, etc. How do you want to earn your living and lead your life should be up to you and you alone, IMHO. If it comes down to something down something along the lines of \\'\"Sharmaji Kya sochenge?\"To kahiye sharmaji khud ke baare me soch lein, hum apna dekh lenge.\\' The way you wrote your post. It seems you stopped before you even started. \\n\\n\\nYou really are not perfect are you comrade I\\'m 36 and can\\'t afford a car. Forget driving anything. >I\\'m  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I\\'m afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports\\n\\nThat\\'s my description. Except I\\'m 22 Oh man that line 19 and can\\'t ride a bicycle hit me. I am 20 i wasn\\'t able to ride bicycle but few months back i made up my mind that i will learn after a week i was able to ride a little bit now i can ride a motorbike (not perfect ) . And also i have started focusing on my life i learned c , python and have started focusing on study . I would also like to mention i flunked in maths in 12 so i would like to say its never too late to change. 23, graduated last year, was working at a job I\\'d landed through campus placements.\\nBut quit, because, big dreams, preparing for a very unpredictable exam with no back-ups whatsoever.  \\nNo idea what\\'s going to happen if my plan falls apart. Im 19 and I haven’t spoken to a girl in over 7 months I\\'m 27 and I\\'m alone. I\\'m 19 and I can\\'t speak to someone(immediately) new especially if they are girls or someone of greater my age! I\\'m 20 and feel you. Financial freedom will get you out of misery. Try doing things that can get you some money here and there. Stock trading and shit. Once you start making enough on the side to help with some expenses at home meanwhile you do stuff for yourself nobody will say shit. I honestly feel like people need to know this one trick. It is a shame that you feel that way. Unfortunately Indian parents have a tendency to push their own fragile ego and aspirations on their kids. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you and don\\'t let the things that your parents say get inside of your head. Get a job, become financially independent and move out. Just do not continue to engage in the toxicity of your parents otherwise things will only become worse for you. I am around 40. I moved to Europe decades ago for IT work, which I am still doing. A lot of my friends in India, some didn\\'t even finish school, are now vastly better off that me financially. Two owns businesses and employs 50+ people. At least 6 have amassed so much wealth (land, properties) that they could retire any day they want. I have 20 years left on my mortgage here.\\n\\n/I am not complaining though, I have a very good life. I\\'m 26 and I can\\'t drive (but I\\'m gonna get back to practice soon). Graduated with an engineering degree at 22 from a national top 10 school, but working hard to re-enrol in a good college so I can finally study things I\\'ve always wanted to. Have a lean built but never made a serious effort to get a buff physique as I always found gyms expensive. Promised myself I will get over my discomfort and go to the gym every day when I get into college (and finally have time again). 20. Failed 2nd year of med school, taking a break for one year. Dad says he\\'s ashamed of me and wouldn\\'t talk to me. I\\'ve been sent to another city because he can\\'t stand seeing my face, or hearing my voice. I can\\'t talk to people my own age or people in general for that matter, even for small talk. I\\'m overweight. I\\'m 17 and supposed to crack JEE but don\\'t know shit about solving those kind of problems, JEE starts on 8 Jan, fml 22 and can\\'t drive because I hit my face on an iron fence while learning. Safe to say I\\'m perpetually petrified of vehicles and fences. \\n\\nAlso intrusive thoughts. Does anyone else deal with thoughts that\\'d lead to brutal death while driving without anything even happening or is it just me lol I’m 31 and never been in a real romantic relationship. Wtf is wrong with me. The worst thing is the disappointment more than unemployment you see on the other fucking faces that we\\'ve let them down voluntarily & suddenly we become the bad guy \\nFuck this society I\\'m in my 3rd year of engineering. I feel like a complete shit. My parents are supportive of my decisions, but I give up things when the going gets tough for example Competitive coding and divert myself with porn or reddit.  \\n\\nI do not have a routine. I lack consistency and discipline. But I want to get rid of this lethargic feeling that I get. Man... I\\'m loosing control over my actions. Any advise would be appreciated kind Randians. i choose Non medical but i dont wanna join IIT 20s, I fell from my scooter once, it wasn\\'t a big fall neither was it very serious but couldn\\'t bring myself to drive a two wheeler again. Learnt to drive my car, once i couldn\\'t start my car on time after the green light and i don\\'t need to explain the commotion i created at that time, which scared me a lot and im too scared to drive now. Also my left leg feels like it will fall off in pain due to me controlling the clutch in heavy bangalore traffic. So im a lazy and untalented according to my parents. Lol ok parents, im your child who has your genes\\n\\nalso using public transport is better for the Environment Exams after two days and I haven\\'t completed anything properly. I am 18 and I have zero self confidence and even though I have been a performer before, now I am just really scared of going on stage and its funny because in my life  all I wanted was to be on a stage performing.\\n\\np.s. I am a trained dancer. 28 still studying .. This website is weird AF.\\n\\n\\\\> I\\'m  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I\\'m afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports\\n\\nSports? Never knew Indian parents gave two shits about sports. Play anything, you will get flying HC Verma on your face [deleted] Indians parents are one of the worst in the world. I am 1.6lpm guy but my failure  count is much more than  success count . Sure, society does put pressure but don\\'t use the anti-thesis to just be lazy. Dream, work for them, else life is just pointless void without real higher purpose anyway. Bro. Just find out what you really like and work towards it. It might be against their will but that\\'s how you can give an answer to them and to the society. 20 and still confused if I want to become a software engineer or a musician. I mean I love both but I\\'m not very good in either of them. :( Rather than think about what you are not good at, think about what you like and are good at or can be good at.\\nYou don’t judge a horse by how fast it swims and a fish by how fast it runs.\\n\\nIf you are not good at studies, maybe you like cooking, or art, or sports, or gardening etc.\\n\\nFind your passion...\\nDon’t let a negative opinion define you. This is all a direct result of Capitalism tbh. I\\'m n years old, and I can\\'t do a lot of things - but unlike the losers who don\\'t want to put in the effort to be able to do those things, I genuinely want to improve, and am working toward being what I expect myself to be, instead of whining about it on the internet. In the mid-20s. Unemployed for over a year. No social life anymore. Skinny, tall and bald. Very anxious about everything. I\\'m good at driving, just anxious. Failed driving test. 23 and hate myself to the core. I had social anxiety so talking to others really makes me nervous. I am so perfectly imperfect. I\\'m in my late twenties and I\\'m rediscovering life after nearly a decade of depression.\\n\\nI\\'m still depressed, of course, but I don\\'t have to let that define me, or dictate who I am or my actions. I\\'ve been depressed so long that my childhood memories seem like they happened to someone else. Like I was an observer to my own childhood.\\n\\nBut eventually the clouds will clear, even if it seems impossible. We will never be perfect, but we will bear our crosses and carry on. Because that\\'s life. Suffering, peppered with moments of joy, pain, heartbreak, melancholy, and loneliness.\\n\\nYou\\'ll be alright. We all will be. Its perfectly fine to be self-aware and being comfortable with yourself. But more importantly its necessary to try and fail rather than just being a silent observer and judging other\\'s opinions. If you have anything that keeps you awake at night, you must pursue that coz it\\'s the effort that counts more than success usually. I dont like any sports thats just okay. But ARE YOU AN ENGINEER ? Abey fuck same Logged in to tell you this. I learnt to cycle at age 28 and now I often bike 30 kms to work. Hang in there dude, you\\'ll get there.! The way you wrote your post. It seems you stopped before you even started. \\n\\n\\nYou weren\\'t joking when you said you weren\\'t perfect comrade I am 21, I\\'m scared to learn to drive a car. I also sometimes feel like I\\'ve wasted myself academically to the point that there\\'s no climbing back up for me. I also put off seeing a psychologist cause I feel anxious to even go lol I moved to Canada when I was 22 and long story short, I fucked some things up and came back to India 2 years later. Now I\\'m 25, battling depression, still unemployed but trying my best, listening to parents\\' whining almost every Sunday.\\n\\nSo, you\\'re good! I am 23, and not able to drive a bike, recently learnt to ride scooty on street. I am graduated and got a decent job with decent pay. Yet, so doubts that not able to interact and have a deep conversation with anyone easily. Lonely af. Still life is beautiful. I have been a \" Sharma ji ka beta\" Kinda guy in whole life. So can\\'t even complain. :). I like how OP is talking about accepting ones faults while the comments are filled with suggestions on how to fix that fault. \\n\\nThanks for proving his point? I\\'m 30, fat(29 BMI) and haven\\'t gotten promoted in a looooong time! I am 21 and i cant talk to girls. Yea the irony being ( in relation to the post) I know what iam doing but it ain’t progressing. \\n\\nFingers crossed As someone who\\'s disabled and struggles with mental health, I\\'ve had a lot of other things happen in my life that has made me feel in similar ways. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI have developed a very anticapitalist mindset as a result. Fucking wholesome this thread. I\\'m 26, graduated in hotel management, decided not to pursue the career, did MBA in marketing didn\\'t wanted to do field work, did digital marketing course, didn\\'t liked it, so here i am, working in a KPO as a fresher, on minimum wages, clueless of what I am going to do next.... Oh and did I tell u that I am socially awkward and a virgin who never had a girlfriend, yeah that and I sometimes hope for an alien invasion so that my society\\'s focus diverts from me! I\\'m 19 (M)\\n\\nFirst year at IIT. \\n\\nSevere body dysmorphia that I tell no one about. \\n\\nAn ldr that I\\'m desperately invested in. \\n\\nNo friends in college. \\n\\nRead incel websites and find myself agreeing with bits and pieces of it. Feel terrible immediately afterwards. We all Drew a tangent to the op conversation. I have heard countless stories of your loved ones comparing you to someone else. I feel so hopeless for such loved ones of mine they have spent all of their life comparing crying and living to fit in the society. “You have to this to make good name” “what will society think” “will you go marry a girl pf different caste and make us look like we raised a fool” The core message is *stop living for people and society start living for yourself*. I hope to get this in my grand pa’s head someday! You just copied my situation, although I\\'m 18, not 19. Guess some things about boomers never change. You are not trying to achieve and like to stay remain where you are so, not taking any chance to do new thing. Thats great. People should accept you. You are normal. Don\\'t listen other. Do what you want. I dropped out for 3 years and did nothing with that time Seeing all the people who are scared to drive I think you could also blame Indian roads and driving practices. I too hate driving because I have a terrible attention span. But it\\'s doable as long as you take enough caution. I am trying to loose weight since 2006, I am 26 😢 The other day I saw fuckin rickshaws drive on the footpath , ofc now I\\'m scared to drive I\\'m 19 and I\\'m in college and I just feel numb most of the time and I\\'m lacking self esteem and have zero ambition in life. I don\\'t know how I\\'m gonna get through this but I\\'m going to fucking get out of this shitty state. That’s just bad parenting - showing that your parents aren’t perfect either :) I\\'m 18, and feel isolated in most social situations. The few people I am close with to the point where this isn\\'t a factor are toxic and make me a worse version of myself. I want to make better, more meaningful relationships but my low self-confidence and insufficient social aptitude make it difficult.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n:\\') I am 22, overweight, and procrastinate alot I am 17 and very socially awkward.

Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.\"* --Mahatma Gandhi Okay guys, I will start practicing driving yet again this week.. I\\'ve been neglecting this due to the anxiety of driving a car after I near drove my car into a marsh People who complain about a generation forget who raised them. Expectation is a two way street. I\\'m 19 and I\\'ve lost interest in life. Don\\'t give a fuck about anything, not even my parents. I haven\\'t cried properly in 4 years thanks to extreme bullying and shaming in high school. Don\\'t get me wrong , I love life. Suicide is the last thing i will ever think about. But , I just want to have more confidence  in myself. I\\'m completely emotionless, have 0 interest in life in any aspect. I don\\'t play any game more than 3 minutes, don\\'t read a book or a topic more than 2 lines and give up on a task even before I start.  I just want to feel an emotion. that\\'d be good. Hello there. Well hate to break it to you, but you are not even at the worst stage of your life. Soon in a few years you\\'ll be pressured to get married. And yes arranged. And if you still don\\'t have a job? Be ready to face the wrath of your parents. Yeah Indian society. I mean of course they mean well but this isn\\'t the way. Man sometimes i think what if I become scientist or programmer should I\\'d be happy I am 21, too chickenshit to drive or ride a bike, thinking about dropping out of post grad I am 23 and I was super scared to drive in India. While my friends had their licenses and driving their cars, I used sit in the back seat. It\\'s only when I moved abroad I learnt how to drive. Oh and I also dont know how to ride a bicycle, bike or even swim.\" I\\'m 19 too and I can\\'t think anything else other than just killing myself. I\\'m 29 and I\\'ve not saved my first million ₹ yet. 22. IIT graduate. Didn\\'t learn a thing about Engineering. No idea what to do with my life. I can relate, buddy. \\nIndian parents expect their children to be like satya nadela or Bill gates. \\nWhen we tell them that we can\\'t, they come up with bullshit stuff like - \\'look at that guy, he had nothing and now he is -insert a high level title-\\' \\nOr  \\' We sacrificed so much for you, at least do this or that\\' I am 23 (M). Here are some of my flaws/failures:\\n\\n1. I didn\\'t complete a B.Tech. from IIT or a B.Sc. from St. Stephen\\'s. I could never sort out my priorities as a teenager so I ended up attending a \"decent-ish\" DU college instead. \\n\\n2. I do not work for McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Amazon, or Google. My family believes that I am competent enough to reach great heights, and I try my best to make them proud, but so far my path has only been full of disappointment.\\n\\n3. My girlfriend, whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, grew uncertain about the future of our relationship so I ended things on a bitter note.

Decathlon near my home organise events, from small walks for a cause to random cycling. Though a small town, it often has active participation of locals. \\n\\nAlso, their staff are directly involved in these training activites, kinda makes the whole experience great. More than a shop, it gives a socialising platform in sports field. Thank you Decathlon, for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Asics, NB nervous.  These people have made their products like 50 -100 % more expensive in India as compared to the west.  Largely making common products out of reach for the middle class.  \\n\\nNike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement. So much so that when NRI travel to India they bring shoes as gifts to please my family. \\n\\nFor context: A 100 $ Asics running shoe is  Rs14000 in India. What kind of business model is this? I\\'m going to decathlon for sure TIL Decathlon is French [deleted] Decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty. :) \\n\\nFuk u Adidas I don\\'t know of anyone\\'s been to decathlon\\'s in Bangalore but somehow in all of them, the helper staff seem like well off upper middle class people in their 20s, you can tell from the way they speak and dress, their English is like those South Bombay kids. I have even seen foreigners work as staff. This is very weird because you don\\'t see people who are well off doing jobs that are considered menial by a lot of people. Does decathlon pay really well or something. Reduced visits to Decathlon, because I end up spending more than I need to. The assortment is so good and the quality is first class. I just live their shop man so big and they let you try and play with things. Even the employees at store are so friendly and helpful. I wish more brands adopt this style, I\\'m hopping IKEA has similar experience. \\n\\nThe store in thane had very friendly environment, they trusted customers and I\\'ve seen so many times people shoplifting so they had to start tagging and deploying security at stores. That\\'s just sad. \\n\\nThese Adidas, Nike, puma deserve this. Decathlon cares about sports more than money-making... I fucking love Decathlon. Amazing quality stuff at great prices. I just wish they make a shopping app. Or at least do something w their website. It\\'s really buggy or something Decathlon, The Hamley\\'s for Adults What\\'s the difference between their dry, dry+ and dry+ breathe running t shirts? I heard great things about them from my buddies (so their word of mouth advertising seems to be working well) - will have to visit one day. it is pronounced \"di-ka-thlo\" if anyone is interested I just love Decathlon for their product quality and excellent pricing. It\\'s my go to shop for shoes clothes and basic sport goods. \\n\\nI have met many disabled employees at the Pune store (and I\\'m sure they proactively encourage and hire) which really improves their brand image in front of me. Most of their staff is super young so kudos to them for employing out country\\'s young guns. \\n\\nTheir staff is excellently trained and helps you get the best item possible. Kids cycling and playing in store brings a smile to my face. \\n\\nIf anyone from Decathlon is reading this - Thank you for coming to India! :) I love my decathlon. You can get some nice quality stuff for cheap. the store design is one of the best aspect of them. Explore all you want and buy what you like no interference from staff unless you need it This is really popular in hyderabad This is the place where I end up buying shit I don\\'t need. Nike, Adidas, Puma etc. are expensive just because they want to recover their huge investments in marketing Do they happen to sell them online?? I\\'m hearing about this brand for the first time 😅 Decathlon is my prefferd showroom to buy shoes, pant & physical fitness related things This should be an obvious middle finger in the faces of Nike and other over expensive brands. Decathlon stuff is amazing value for money. Somewhere I read this \"Decathlon is Hamleys for adults\" Shower thought: Decathlon is basically Hamleys for adults. I love everything about them but hate their trail rooms. Everything is perfect there but why they have coffin like squeezy trail rooms?

In fact, it\\'s not very popular outside of the States. While growing in popularity in some western countries, competitive cheerleading is not attached to a lot of sporting events. So, not a lot of what would be called actual cheerleaders would not be found in India. And for IPL, the so called cheerleading was nothing but a commercial eye candy spectacle. Want more people showing up to fill stands, give Indian men white women in skirts to look at. CSK used to have Indian cheerleaders. They even had a guy cheerleader. If I remember correctly there was also something about the colour of our skin. We discriminate a lot (which is also why we don’t see any Latina/Arab or black cheerleaders) Amit Malviya, Tejinder Bugga, Payal Rohatgi would be amazing as cheerleaders They\\'re either gonna get raped, groped, cat called, slut-shamed or all together.\\n\\nOur society is happier oppressing people, human rights & basic human decency and all, are unimportant.\\n\\nAlso,\\n\\n\"Log kya kahenge\"\\n\"Aise kapde pehene to mard kya karega?\" I think its the same reason why we don\\'t have strip clubs. Our society looks down on it because its not pure or its against godliness all that stuff. Must be something about indian mentality. Cheerleading is probably down there with lap dancing and mujhra dancing. People think it\\'s a low job that doesn\\'t deserve any respect. Until this changes then you probably wont see indian cheerleaders on google youtube etc. Its really sad as there is nothing wrong with this type of work. CSK, KKR and the defunct PWI have Indian cheerlearders donning traditional clothes. Google Images should give you some pics! I guess when IPL started, Lalit Modi and the powers at that time decided to import the cheerleaders to get more eyeballs in, and that trend has continued. This is what keeps you up at night?', ' Who are the nice people offering the food? Is it an NGO? One woman seems uniformed. Are they from the government? UP Delhi border from last two days is uncontrollable.

Sure, there is some gratitude behind them, but know this: behind every tear the poor shed, there is restrained anger, hidden shame, wounded pride. Every one of those tears is telling them that this is no way of living, only to have to live like that for many, many days to come. Someone will come who will weaponize those emotions and no tyrant will be able to stand against them. For now, all we can do is hope that such a day will come.’ I\\'m kinda torn about this. On the one hand I see the importance of letting the country know how bad the situation has become. On the other, I think taking a  video of this man crying steals the few shreds of dignity he has left. Yaar koi reliable ngo/organisation doing something about this? How can we help?! Source - https://twitter.com/aaqibrk/status/1243594510480707585?s=19 And here I am sitting at my home complaining over small things, seeing this video made me think how undeserving I am, this man probably busts his ass all day providing for his family and that\\'s a normal day.... I can even begin to imagine what so many people are going through, it\\'s as if we are all on a ship and they have been left in the cold dark sea, just with a floater.... I pray they get through this. And the people helping them are absolute heroes. Wish they reach home soon.. We have failed as a society. Imagine being recorded while you shed tears of pain Man this really puts things into perspective. How life can be difficult, unforgiving. At one moment you leave for a city far away with dreams, ambition and hope. And at another all of that is taken from you.  More people are going to suffer due to the unemployed caused by coronavirus than coronavirus itself. This is sad. Very sad. I lost my sadism and sarcasm looking at this i am serious. I never feel so helpless upon seeing these people. No one deserve to face such. \\nI couldn\\'t control my tears. Still thinking why. Corona virus has revealed real, terrible holes in our system. We have an economy that heavily relies on efforts of exactly those who used up and chewed out and treated like dirt.\\n\\nIf we learn anything from this crises, let it be the fact that our neoliberal, capitalist society has time and time again failed vast majority of its participants because of lack of humanity of the process. We need to wake up or this becomes a new normal. Good to see people are coming forward. While it wont do a lot, it is a good place to start. The most shocking part is that some people are blaming these poor folks for the situation. They also applaud each time they see police brutality in the name of this lockdown. Empathy is pretty much dead I think in India. Ok, i get it... it is emotional... but don\\'t zoom in when someone is breaking down..give them some privacy In spite of being a huge critic of Modi, I appreciated the decision of lockdown he took. But at that point of time, I didn\\'t consider the situation of these workers. Of course, he has a team of specialists so they must have known what is gonna happen regarding this. So I don\\'t understand why they couldn\\'t give any time for these workers to reach their villages beforehand by announcing the lockdown a couple of days ahead. All our money is of no use if we can\\'t do anything for humanity. on top of that we are fed hindu muslim pakistan everyday. UP government has recently allotted 1,000 buses to bring people back home. I wish I can make a difference in the world when I grow up 💔 To all my fellow Indians, at a time like this, those of us who have the luxury to stay home and have the means to help others should take care of the less fortunate. We cannot just blame the government and expect them to take care of each an every individual. It is important we the regular people do our part. You can find some NGO to donate to, I hope some here can provide a link of a reliable one but it is better if you find a local initiative in your community. If you dont have one then start one, but it is important if each person contributes to their local community Jo bhi ho, from Demonetisation to Lockdown, it is the lower class people who has to suffer. Oh dear...i teared up a bit there. I cant imagine who to thank the relative comfort i have in life. That lad will do something for himself. The circumstances that have led him and countless others to this situation are so out of their control that tears seem appropriate. I wish him well. Isn\\'t there anything us commoners can do for them from our homes??? Rula diya vencho T_T Why the fuck are they being filmed like that ? A man\\'s having a weak moment. Give them their fucking space. Gosh. Seems more like a gimmick. Sad to see this... I assume this situation is coz of landlords who asked these people to vacate houses as in these times they cannot pay rent. \\n\\nFrom what I know the first migrant worker sets up a base in the city and establishes himself... takes more work and calls more people from his village convincing their families that he\\'ll earn a good amount. They stay in groups of 6-8 or more.\\n\\nHere\\'s the states responsibility of not creating enough jobs is the prime reason. We also should have a threshold limit of population control for each city.  Jo ye bichare jis pareshani se jhuujh rahe hai wo kisi bhi pandemic se badi hai Income inequality aur poverty itni badi emergency ko hum sabne kabhi ek problem k taur per nhi dekha.

This breaks my heart, i hope they reach home safe and sound . This is honestly so fucking sad I am feeling sad for them Damn its tough to watch a grown man breaking apart like that. It\\'s always the poor who suffer the most during time like these. I have nothing but to thank those beautiful souls providing food. Fuck. This broke my heart This made me cry. I beg the government to atleast provide them shelters or transport to reach their homes. The poor always suffers in this nation. Guys please donate to PM CARES fund. what are some legit charities / foundations we can donate to and ensure that our money is well spent These people are the ones building our homes, roads, bridges and the country. It fucking breaks my heart seeing them like this that they are facing hardships getting even a plate of food. Guys, Do you know any NGOs that I can donate to? A trusted NGO? It\\'s so easy to forget about this part of our country while sitting in a well furnished room with all basic amenities. (Myself included). Whoever helps during these times, I wish them every happiness and comfort in their lives. I wish I was earning to contribute in some way. It\\'s ironic but I will say it anyway - \"Together we stand\". The tears from him explain how important food is.  I hope the donors provide free food daily until they have their regular wages. Is there anything Modi does with proper planning? I couldn’t help but break down looking at this. How can I send money to help them ? This gave me chills. Anyone who is privileged enough to be on reddit from the comfort of their homes should be very very grateful. But we all know we will never be. So my tax money goes to netas ghar, 10-20Rs ki chicken in government premises, traveling abroad, buying private jets... This post is not written by drawn into emotions. All of this migration could have been avoided if Modi would have worked with state governments to feed everyone who is out of regular wages (like community kitchen opened across Kerala during this pandemic). Instead he did the usual drama, probably not even consulting his ministers. This migration is going to be the equivalent of army personnels spreading spanish flu to the nooks and corners of Europe. I appreciate the effort and concern but just imagine going into the face of man with a camera/phone and recording him breaking down in tears thats not good. Its partially gratitude and partially embarrassment. \\n\\nOne of the hardest things for anybody in this world is to accept help. It\\'s hard for a man to ask for help.

I don\\'t know how right I am , but I still think instead of  arrangements of Busses to travel back home UP govt. should have invested in Tents or supplies for our fellow migrants workers, for they shouldn\\'t have to be forced to walk back home.\\n\\nWhen asked in various news sources almost everyone said \"Paise Khatam ho gye hai, hum bhukey hai kai dino se, Corona se pehle to hum bhuuk se mar jayenge.\"\\n\\n(Translation: We are hungry and not eaten for many days and we have no money left and will die of hunger even before Corona gets us.)\\n\\nMaybe, just maybe I think they made arrangements for busses because I don\\'t for sure but i think we didn\\'t have enough funds to feed this many people. So they decided to let every help them there houses instead.\\nBut this might backfire as they are so desperate right now that they don\\'t care for social distancing and all.

Why are migrant workers returning to their native places (and potentially bringing the disease to small villages), instead of sheltering in place?

If tomorrow news comes out that some DMart employee half way across the country was infected, does that mean now that we can't go get groceries from any D-Mart? I guess its kind of a CMV. I was thinking about how cooking food requires daily interaction with local grocers for veggies and wanted to compare it with ordering food under lockdown. PS I can do both. \\n\\n1. Supposing delivery executives do 15orders a day, they get to interact with 30 different people. A grocer will be interacting daily with suppliers and customers and the count would be much higher.\\n\\n2. You going to the grocer means interacting directly with a potential carrier(since they are interacting with more people). You meeting a delivery executive should be lower risk because the executive would at max be an intermediate carrier and and 2nd degree.\\n\\n3. the employee was a a Box8 employee. I am not sure if they are as strict and vigilant as swiggy or zomato.\\n\\n4. Ordering meat dishes will always be more nutritious than cooking eggs and veggies provided the cost is affordable.\\n\\n5. The only con I can think of with delivery executives is that they will be driving to all parts of the city, even potential virus hotspots. You grocer will be in your locality. His suppliers might come from other parts but in this case grocer becomes 2nd degree. The suppliers and customers would also be almost same everyday while for delivery executives they would almost certainly be meeting different people every day.\\n\\nMy mind is biased towards ordering and so I wanted to get some counter arguments and whether my line of thinking is correct here. Currently I order only curry while I make rice/roti at home. This makes me order once or twice in two days. If you are ordering rice/roti/noodles your mileage will decrease both in cost and quantity.\\n\\nSee comments:https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2obqh/should_i_really_be_scared_of_the_delivery/ Here only Dominos is taking orders, although with a limited menu.

It is impossible to survive 42 days lock down without government delivering food and essential services at door step.\\n\\nBut government is playing jumlabaazi even in corona pandemic. Felt bad reading about this the other day. While one lot of the poor are reaping all the benefits & demand more, when have this other side who cannot even make ends meet.\\n\\nThe first lot typically are the vote banks of local politicians, while the second lot are usually the migrant workers without a base who have come to earn their livelihood.

And on the other hand, we read media reports of women and children being abused at home... What a stark contrast between the have and the have nots... This is exactly what makes me wonder if the extension of lockdown is helping ppl or is it snatching the last ounce of fighting spirit from ppl who aren\\'t so privileged. Maybe for a decent chunk of population a  3% or 4%  mortality is a  far safer odds than surviving without a livelihood for 40 days. And as that lockdown gets extended more and more ppl are willing to risk those odds No matter where you live, you CAN give food to at least one or two poor families. Your neighbours will see you doing it and some will take your example and do the same. Height of stupidity. People can live for months fasting. His children had food. Not they don\\'t have him.

That's the issue that we're facing. In the hospital almost all out efforts are focused on Covid. But that doesnt mean that other diseases have stopped existing. We're unable to provide start seed of care and patients are scared of coming to the hospitals due to fear of catching covid. Eventually if they do make it to the hospitals it's in an emergency condition. I'm afraid that death rates will spike due to non covid causes as well\", ' I was initially surprised by the exodus of workers. But many interviews have clarified their thinking on the situation and I think it\\'s quite valid. Basically, they\\'re worried that if they fall ill, they have no support net in these city slums. Back home, they at least have family members to take care of them.\\n\\nGiven that politicians often have (or claim to have) their ears to the ground, they should have been aware of this insecurity. I think in hindsight it was better to announce a schedule for the lockdown a few days earlier, transfer funds to their accounts, run maximum number of trains and buses to take everybody back home, let people prepare and stock up, and then start the police curfew lathi raj. Instead, under the excuse of \"preventing panic\", they started with the last first, and now people can neither stay in cities nor go back to their homes, neither have food nor money. *“Recall the face of the poorest and weakest man you have seen, and  ask yourself if this step you contemplate is going to be any use to  him.”*     \\n\\n ―        Mahatma Gandhi The worst thing is he has been asking people for staying back for a number of days now.

It's a stark contrast to what I have experienced in gujarat where I have complained for roads being terrible but they were 100x better than what I experienced there. This lead to a large difference in lifestyles of villages of similar size and comparable resources. My point is, A road can change a lot. I have had a bit of comparable experience in madhya pradesh too. Maybe it was an isolated experience where I found the worse in the bunch but as they say a chain is as strong as it's weakest link.

This is universal, and the only way out of this is to insist you are full when you have a lil bit of space left. This way you can eat their final serving, and continue to flatten your curve as well, so to speak.\\n\\nEdit: Do bring in a dessert sometime. Return the favour! Indian families generally insist on serving more food until you INSIST you are full. It’s a cultural thing. \\n\\nIn older days people were shy to ask more food being guests. This was understood by the host. The hosts, hence tend to feed them more assuming the guest is shy. \\n\\nThese days people are generally very forthcoming (especially in American culture I observe that people are honest and absolute with what they want and how much they want). But sometimes, being hosts, they err on the side of caution to ensure the guest is satisfied. Just insist that you are full politely and say, you have reached your capacity. They will usually understand.\\n\\nAnother thing to do is, hold your palm facing the ground over the plate, to block the food and just insist more telling you are full. This gesture is an accepted gesture in various gatherings.\\n\\nThank them for the food and appreciate the cooking so that they know you are satisfied. \\n\\nHope this helps. Oh boy...I have some good tips for you..\\n\\n1) eat slow\\n2) when you are done, quickly put the bits that have fallen through the edges back into the plate...so the plate becomes unservable\\n3) just get up and wash your hands when done ....no eye contact. \\n\\n\\nTried and tested in the field.\\nP.S: all techniques tested on my wife\\'s family where I face the same issue. I am fasting today. Typical Indian household lol. It\\'s endearing in a way but tbh I always feel like I can\\'t walk or that I am going to throw up.\\n\\nJust insist that you are full and just ask small quantities of different varieties of food. It wont be that bad once they are used to have you around during lunchtime and get familiar with your portion sizes. Just eat real slow, they will get it that you are having trouble finishing it. Tell them that you will ask if you want more, or that you will take the food by yourself when you want more (e.g tell them “you guys also eat, I’ll take how much ever I want, I don’t want to trouble you”) . Eat slow to match speed of others eating in the house. Or tell that if you eat a lot, you will end up feeling ill. Initially Smile and after 2-3 times, tell politely but firmly with semi-serious face. Many years ago, a fellow American friend I knew in Dilli consumed an entire stick of butter out of politeness. The cultural norm is that as a guest, if you actually do want to be served more food, you only refuse ***mildly.*** Guests will usually not directly say - \"Yes, I do want more\". Instead they will just not protest too strongly when the hosts are serving you more food. So, when you actually do become full and definitely don\\'t want more, you have to politely but very firmly say no. You have to insist, like one of the other comments said. Don\\'t worry, it\\'s not rude. Another tip is - eat slowly. If you finish too fast, they\\'ll think you\\'re still hungry. Why do you think most Indians have a potbelly and are generally unfit? I don\\'t understand what it is with Parents and relatives that they will always put more than you need in your plate and think that its healthy to eat more while it\\'s clearly not. My diet always gets screwed because of my parents overfeeding me even if I refuse to eat more. They just put more on the plate and I have to eat because I don\\'t like wasting food. I need to be more stern otherwise I have to spend more time with my dumbells to shed those extra carbs. Refusing food is not rude unless you do it rudely Fast for a day I\\'d say it\\'s better to say you\\'re full, since it works like a charm for me. TBH it\\'s my family hence I don\\'t get pushed too often. It is typical of many families to insist one more portion to ensure even the meek leave with full tummy. Some hosts keep on feeding even if they might not have sufficient for themselves. They also believe that \\n\\nThe way you’d refuse - once you have eaten to your liking, say that you liked it so much that you already are full to your heart’s content and do not have room for more. Say you don’t shy from food and if needed you’ll ask for more by yourself (say this in a jolly tone). Also, as others have said, physically block them from serving another portion by holding your hand slightly above your plate or bowl. That’s an accepted way of saying you don’t want more. Tell them you have an upset stomach. That\\'s what I do! Something I do, but only if people are very insistent: I yank my plate off the table and protect it with my hand until the other person retreats.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis absolute last resort, but if your plate isn’t there, they can’t serve you. you should say that you are following very strict diet plan. Relax. It\\'s just culture. You have to refuse lovingly, three or four times before they\\'ll stop asking. Tell them you had something to eat already somewhere else. say you have allergies. Keep passing comments like,\\n\\n* today the food is a little oily\\n\\n* salt is less in the food today\\n\\n* I think the gravy stinks, was it yesterday\\'s dish you recycled?\\n\\n* Roti could\\'ve been softer\\n\\n*  Daal at the house next door at Sharma\\'s is tastier\\n\\n\\nif they still offer you food. Quit\\n\\nedit: Clearly this is being taken as a serious comment. I was in the mood to shit post. My bad. Take but don\\'t eat. I know its not good to waste food but it\\'s perhaps the only way. Ensure that the food gets wasted by may be mixing curries with staple, half eating sweets etc. When they ask you, say you are full and can\\'t eat anymore. They will still continue giving excessive food to you for a few days. But then they will start paying heed to your words gradually.\\n\\nE : It worked for me everywhere.

This breaks my heart, I just feel like blaming myself, what is the point of blaming anyone else, we as a species are a failure if situation like these keep arising. I know the person who took this photo maybe had good intentions but I personally would never be able to take a photo like this. We can never think of being a developed nation with kids starving :( Now Bhukts and other supporters will try to find out some past insident from RG's or some other opposition leaders constituency of people eating shit and say why no one had issue at that time and why only now. Man I am just fed up with all this whataboutery.

This is a complete failure of TMC government, and has nothing to do with poor implementation of lockdown or something else. And knowing how corrupt Mamata is, the ration distributor won't even get arrested. He will be given other attempts to steal the supplies while Mamata and her team keeps blaming the central government.

According to early estimates, more than 1 crore people have already seen these videos, suggesting a high degree of circulation and impact.\\n\\n> \"Several of these videos appear to be shot in Pakistan and Middle East but audio in Hindi has been superimposed to make it look like its shot in India,\" the 22-page report, which the Delhi Police has shared with various intelligence agencies, says.\\n\\n> \"Our analysis has revealed an alarming number of videos are being shared advising Muslims not to practice social distancing and several suggesting that coronavirus does not kill Muslims,\" a senior police official said.\\n\\n> According to him, the analysis also revealed a pattern in dissemination of misinformation.\\n\\n> \"While analysing the origins and sources of these videos, it was observed that several of the accounts which originally created them are being deleted regularly after the content goes viral to hide its origin,\" he said.\\n\\n> \"Considering the fact that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing software, being viralled (sic) on social media platforms, original uploader accounts being deleted, and certain accounts peddling fake news among Muslims are promoting Pakistani religious leaders with terror links. A further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated,\" the report says.\\n\\n> According to the investigation, Chinese-owned video sharing app TikTok is the most preferred medium for creating and spreading videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding the coronavirus. These videos are further being shared on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter.\\n\\n> Videos of Muslims refusing to get themselves tested and beating medical personnel were being spread and others were also being encouraged to do the same, the report says.\\n\\n> Religious texts are being quoted to not stop shaking hands and people are being encouraged to go to their religious shrines even during lockdown, it adds.\\n\\n> Authorities have expressed concern about the impact of these videos amid attacks on medical personnel like in Madhya Pradesh\\'s Indore this week and the emergence of a cluster in Delhi because of a gathering held by a Muslim missionary group last month that has spawned dozens of cases across the country.\\n\\n> In the investigation into the Delhi congregation, the police are looking into a sermon allegedly by the chief cleric of the group Tablighi Jamaat that termed the directions of doctors as \"a conspiracy to keep Muslims away from fellow Muslims\".\\n\\n> Since then, Maulana Saad Kandhalvi has officially issued an audio message to his followers asking them to cooperate with the government to fight the disease.\\n\\n> \"We have to take precautions, follow the guidance of the doctors and give full support to the government such as not crowding into places. This is not against the principles of Islam,\" he said.\\n\\n> While at around 2,000 cases and 53 deaths, the spread of coronavirus in India is far more limited than in Europe and the US, health experts have warned that the numbers could surge across the country if the contagion takes root. https://www.altnews.in/old-unrelated-video-shared-as-muslims-licking-utensils-to-spread-coronavirus-infection/\\nAtleast this one has been debunked Saw this on my group of old friends.

According to the description of the video, the people seen in the video are Dawoodi Bohras, who are licking the utensils in an attempt to follow their belief of zero wastage of food\\n\\n\\n>Furthermore, the website of the Dawoodi Bohras states that they follow a tradition of eating meals on a steel ‘thaal’, which is designed to accommodate a group of 8 or 9 people. They also strictly follow a policy of no wastage of food - “Bohras have a no-wastage policy so not a single morsel should be left on the thaal when it is taken away”.

Uber Eats had great offers and seemed affordable compared to the other two. Also, their customer service was miles ahead of others, at least for me. Zomato still owes me ₹130 I think. Pretty weird why they did it. It was a dead company. The user base was overlapping. For 3 50 million dollars, they have not acquired anything ground breaking. Its just waste of precious money. It will be duopoly as it is other sectors too. More discounts on the way! Very bad Uber bhuko ka sasta sahara Investors - wait for the dip and buy $UBER.

When the executive refused saying he'll be penalized for going off route, they insisted he come there and they'd pay him 30 or 40 bucks. Being the naive fellow he was, he's gone there for the money and guess what, they've given him 10 bucks. When he expressed his disappointment, they've attempted to assault him. He was pretty shaken up. I told him not to worry and come to my place. Tipped him well and I was even more sad because the guy was very young. I learnt not to act hastily without empathy. He was likely hoping that you cancel the order. \\nI have also heard of people taking the order ans asking delivery guy to not mark it as delivered and instead cancelling the order. \\nThis I heard from a ex delivery guy. All safety standards down the toilet. Post on social media to raise awareness. had a similar incident yesterday, where the app showed that the order was delivered when it wasn't.\\n\\nreported it and got a refund. It's possible that police may be stopping the delivery guys at every barricade ??\", \" I am an employee at Reliance and I have been harassed multiple times for bringing chicken or fish in my lunch box.

Funnily only in Bangalore offices for some reason I work in Anil's reliance's campus in Navi Mumbai for a client company. It is the same there. You cannot eat non veg on your desk either. People still eat non veg in campus though but you have to be careful not be seen by security. There is a hospital in Bandra, Mumbai frequented by celebs which doesn’t allow staff or patients to bring non-veg food inside. The security opens staff’s (esp nurses) lunch boxes and inspects your food! The restaurants and canteens inside are obviously ‘pure’ veg. Lmao, reminds of the time in elementary school when my classmates used to bully me for bringing chicken nuggets on Tuesdays. I worked in a school where majority Gujaratis sent their kids. One of the Koli (fishing community) kids used to be badly bullied and left alone for lunch because she brought chicken. She used to cry everyday. When I told the principal about this and how we should be teaching children acceptance she said that the parents would stop donating and pull kids out of the school so they couldn’t do anything. I ate lunch with that girl almost everyday instead. India hasn't moved on from the 1800's, it seems. No eggs?

It causes them be discomfort sitting in same area where non-veg is served or is being eaten. This is fine with me.  I guess the rest of the food court is strictly non-veg. Vegetarianism is obviously the right choice, but it still has to be a 'choice'. Dhokla Dhokla everywhere I'm about to join Reliance corporate park . Can I PM you for some questions please ?

I\\'ve only eaten beef this one time and it nearly killed me. \\n\\nThe meat was nice, the lynchers on the other hand not so much. I\\'m a mostly-vegetarian Hindu who can eat meat if there is no veggie alternative, or if said alternative has been had three times in a row. There\\'s only so much salad I can do. This isn\\'t for moral reasons; not having grown up eating meat means that the taste and texture are still alien to me. But I defend the practice of meat eating to my conservative friends and family. I tell them to (a) stop being hypocritical and (b) learn about other Hindus in India. \\n\\nI point to their and their children\\'s leather shoes and ask whether the cow voluntarily donated its skin, and whether it continued to live after they were well shod. \\n\\nI point to the fact that of the top six exporters of beef in the world, three are Hindus. What do they feel about it? \\n\\nMillions of Hindus visit the Kullu Dusshera festival, where animals are sacrificed and the meat is eaten as prasad. The head priest of the Hidimba temple does the sacrifice. \\n\\nSome of their favourite BJP politicians wear leather shoes, and some, such as Sangit Som (one of the most vicious anti-beef proponents) have owned meat-exporting companies. Overall, beef  exports have risen under the Modi regime. DM me your best place to order beef from For an average Keralite beef with beef is a cultural shock.

I just don\\'t happen to understand us, the Hindus of India. Be careful bro. Better go to a restaurant and eat rather than getting it delivered by brainwashed Sanghis. Just call customer care and get him fired. So now u got beef with zomato. Yesn\\'t. Fuck them. This kind of stuff reduces my belief in ..religions.

We are definitely testing less than other countries. \\n2. The real spike is yet to be seen. We may still have a surge of cases. Too early to say that we have less cases. \\n3. We don\\'t know what the reson is for lower virulence in indians. A newly discovered mRNA in indians might be protective, as can be lower levels of ACE2. \\nThere are other countries like Australia as well where they have very less mortality.\\n4. We really are in no position to handle a situation like new york or Lombardy.\\n\\nEdit. We have confirmed reports that some hospitals are hiding positive cases.\\n\\nEdit 2 . The hospital has come out with a press release admitting that they indeed have 3 positive cases. However, we have known it for atleast 3 days now. They hid it from the media for atleast 3 days,  maybe more. I have a question though, Let\\'s say India didn\\'t have 700 but 700,000 cases in reality.\\n\\nNot testing would result in low count, but you would still have sudden surge in people reporting to hospitals wouldn\\'t you?  Or even sudden surge in deaths related to pneumonia. \\n\\nI just think that if numbers were as big as some are claiming them to be, like in the 200k to 500k range. We would\\'ve definitely seen a situation where our hospitals would be overloaded and it would\\'ve been difficult to hide that in a country like India. For those who are thinking this is not true.  \\nI would say just wait.\\n\\nFor those who are thinking we should do more tests.   \\nI wish India had capacity for it.\\n\\nFor those who want India should have done better.  \\nIndia is still a poor nation now it would be getting worse.\\n\\nFor those who are trying to give it a religion or political angle.  \\nF\\\\*\\\\*K YOU [removed] It has been noted and stated by many that India does lack testing facilities.

I was thinking that we might be testing less than required but today I came across this article which gave a bit of solace. \\n https://www.indiaspend.com/1-in-50-covid-19-tests-in-india-are-coming-out-positive-compared-with-1-in-4-in-italy-1-in-10-in-the-uk/\\n\\nThey discuss the ratio of confirmed cases to total number of tests. Quoting from the article:\\n\\nIndia tested 25,254 samples as of 8 p.m. on March 25, of which 581 (2.3%) were positive, according to the latest update from the Indian Council of Medical Research. This proportion is comparable with South Korea\\'s (3%) and higher than Taiwan\\'s (1%).\\n\\nIn comparison, 74,386 of 324,445 tests (23%) in Italy, 6,001 of 35,995 tests (16.7%) in Austria, 65,497 of 484,062 tests (13.5%) in the US and 9,529 of 97,019 tests (10%) in the UK were positive.\\n\\nMore targeted testing in other countries could also be a reason for their higher percentages. [removed] Just being a negative nancy is she ^/pj let\\'s not forget we indians don\\'t like going to docters and prefer self-medication. Pretty sure many people especially in age 20-40 sitting home with virus Keeping the mortality rate at 1%, I would state that the real number is affected cases at the max could be 2,000 from the current near 1000. So we\\'re off by a factor of 2 Death rate is more reliable than number of cases (for countries with democracy). Death toll in India is currently 20. Since it\\'s in initial stage in India, we can take mortality rate of 2%. Now after calculating we get roughly 1000 cases which is in line with currently 902 cases. You can add 100 to 200 in 1000 cases but not more than that. I believe that government is actively working on this problem, major decisions regarding converting schools in hospitals, railway coach into quarantine center, developing new methods of testing etc.\\nSo we as Indian need to contribute to the efforts of government in any way and manner we can. Just like rape in Saudi Arabia. No report, no rape.\\n\\nNo test, no corona.\\n\\nGo corona. Think about Bangladesh then. They are even more crowded than us. I believe they are one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Haven\\'t heard much about COVID from them though. So India has 2.5% of hit rate on the tests.\\nWhile other countries have ~10%.\\nAnd India has been denying tests to most who show up.\\nHow do we explain this? Keyword \"may\" day 1 50 infected  \\nday 2 > those 50 infected 500 more  \\n \\nEdit : R0 is not a constant 10 permanently, is an example, the numbers can vary based on precautions taken and communities may have higher or lower rates of spread and it may also mean R0 can rise day by day, or go down day by day. Please refer to the statistical data and feel free to calculate again if my example doesn\\'t satisfy you. Reasoning behind using R0 = 10,  the inadequate tests and spread rates that are partially evident, 66% as mild symptoms = conservative side of 80% as on some sites. Once again kept R0 as 0, considering it is not contained and during incubation period one person can easily come in contact with atleast 10-15. Also there is an error it won\\'t be day 2 for 500, day 2 = incubation period started so should be day 4 or day 5 to get to 500. Resulting in a possible 12 day delay in actual show of 50 to 500. 6 days to spread, and 8 days for the spreaded to be in turn infected again. I may have accidentally skipped any info please let me know in comments. \\n\\nbreakdown of those 500 :\\n\\n\\\\> >  66% (300) show mild symptoms and their immunity kicks in and a fraction of them recover without even consulting a doctor (recovery period about 1 week with 1 week incubation period, aka 2 weeks of being a potential spreader), while some of them do get a few symptoms a fraction practises quarantine and some meds and gets better, never realizing they were infected with covid 19, most of this group)  \\n\\n\\n\\\\> > 33% (200) which will show symptoms and get worse progressively and more likely visit hospitals, even a small fraction of this will not get self treated and may recover or some may die, post mortem will they be classified as covid 19 death ? now the reports which we do know are covid 19 are an actual subset of this 200 people group, which will show up on radar approx 4 days after day 2, aka on day 6.  \\n\\n\\ndue to eventually finding out, we also miss on a good chunk of the carriers who will not be tested and will add easily to the exponential growth, all the while the actual cases which are severe will be followed with a 4-5 day delay, which is enough to track down for maybe 50 cases but for 500 carriers not possible in absence of widespread testing  \\n\\n\\nthis can be visualized mathematically, easily remember to factor in the methods of verification of a positive case from the 10 actual infected, the carriers are least likely to be tested or quarantined. Also considering weather changes and other factors many of this symptoms, a common citizen  may  think of as weather change issue and not some corona virus infection that is taking root. So true. That\\'s why kerala shows more cases as they check vigilantly. I have been thinking about this exactly. We\\'ll know in the next few days how many cases pop up. Explains why Kerala has more confirmed cases compared to other states. More people are being tested and put under observation. [removed] I think the number of deaths in the coming days will reflect the amount of infected people. Deaths might be a better indicator. Take Kerala for example.\\nNearly 5k have been tested but the cases are less than 200, and most of them are nri\\'s, even after some of them contacted with many people. So, even though testing should be done, it is not necessary that all of them end up being covid patients. And a country like India, it is not possible that large number of patients exist and not showing symptoms or not take treatment in hospitals. Bangladesh. With 200 mil people only 48 effected and 4 dead! Negative Nancy. /s The dance reason why our divorce rates are lower.Ignoring the dysfunction Yes low cases count in india but i think its  just beginning. Becuase of people stay at home\\n\\nAccording to my view in india have no enough resources for controlling this virus .\\n\\nso best tools is to maintain this level is  stay home &  safe Well, thats actually true. 2 days ago only 21k tests were conducted. Not shocked to know that people needed an expert\\'s opinion to know this. I don’t think we can place any blame for this. We don’t have enough resources to test widely. Which in itself is a shame. see I read somewhere that if we calculate the percentage from the people infected and the death count in the world, it comes out to be about 4.59% and we know that so far we\\'ve had 20 death so far so if we consider even 1% of that it becomes around 2000 people. There is going to be sudden influx of cases in the coming days. we will definitely know if more deaths are happening.\\n\\n in fact there are more people in community but they seem to have a mild infection. the death rate will be much lower. Ground reality is very bad, even in authorized government hospitals they are not interested in taking samples. :( I have a source and. I was told the in dharavi local transmission has switched to community and people are being sent back saying that it is influenza.\\nMost cases in country are of local transmission and in about 2 weeks there will be a blast in cases well where are the dead than? Lack of testing is the reason. Thanks Nancy! My theory is that since it was during new year when the viruse started spreading and since most of the students from China, go to us/Europe for studies, these countries were badly affected. \\nItaly has direct flight to and fro Wuhan combined with people not taking seriously in Italy caused serious damage.\\nUS, same. Large number of students/working professionals escaping china to usa for studies/work but bringing disease with them.\\n\\nIndia on other hand has large number of students studying in China, so when they returned, they were quarantined immediately. Rest of cases came when the Chinese people in infected countries spread infection, and since many students study in USA/Europe, they brought disease with them. But by that time proper precautions were in place. But still due to its hard to detect and people doing shady things like travelling even though it was adviced to self quarantine, consuming paracetamol etc to escape quarantine is the cause of spread in India. \\n\\nIn simple sense \\n\\nDirect spread\\nChina -> USA\\nChina -> Europe \\n\\nIndirect spread\\nChina -> US/Europe -> India\\n\\nStill GOI should look out. What\\'s the deal with Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin combination being used for treatment ?\\nPeople hoarding medicines and using them prophylactiaclly and as for statistics  \\nEVERYONE of you PLEASE refer country wise day to day growth !!  \\n\\n\\nIn number of cases  \\n\\n\\nfrom 600 cases to 4 days how many did each country add when they were at 6xx positive infected, and how many after 4 days were added  \\n\\n\\nwe crossed 6xx mark and 4 day from that what will be our situation will likely to resemble the exponential growth curve we are following, some countries are ahead of us, we might find which country is closest approximation in spread as to us. it is still an approximation not that they curves may be exactly similar, but likely to be similar This is major absurd. Lack of testing? No. We have all the medical care you get in T1 countries. Don\\'t judge us like that. We took precautions wayyyy before. Lockdown is the reason for this. Many countried despite having more cases are not on Lockdown. USA for instance. https://scroll.in/pulse/957380/testing-is-key-to-fighting-coronavirus-so-why-does-india-have-such-a-low-testing-rate With morning walks banned, people have become emboldened. /s That\\'s basically the only point I\\'ve been making in my house for the past week. Not sure if hygiene hypothesis works here but either way Indian population has insanely good immunity in general, we have young population, with our tropical temperature and the lockdown that has been going in full force, I don\\'t think we will ever see a big surge here. Our healthcare system is pretty solid, even without resources they manage hell on a daily basis. And people are actually taking quarantine and social distancing seriously. Even in our remote village workers in the farm know the basic dos and don\\'ts and follow them rigorously.', ' Please remember that top level comments are reserved for questions only. Thanks and have fun! Do you think Indian healthcare is capable of dealing with an outbreak of cases in the future ? In your opinion, is there a chance of widespread community transmission in India?\\n\\nIs there any chance that the Indian summer may help beat the virus back? How likely is a medical professional to catch the Corona virus in India while being actively involved in aid of a positive patient? More likely than western/developed nations or less likely? 🤔 as per the data from [here](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6), cases outside China reached 47k from Jan 20 to March 12, but since then additional 57k cases were reported from 13th to 17th. \\n\\nis the communal spreading has begun in most countries ? How does pulmonary damage work, and what does it actually mean?\\n\\nIs it possible to revert the pulmonary damage caused to a corona virus survivor? How can I self quarantine without endangering family members? \\ne.g \\n1 - What\\'s the proper to clean dishes used by me(who\\'s in quarantine)? \\n2 - Should I use different bathrooms?\\n3 - How to clean clothes used by me? \\n\\nThanks Do you think the testing strategy should be amended as the current one does not account for community spread? Do you think we are able to test enough? Do you see an outbreak in India like Italy? Thanks for this. Can we trust the numbers on the news ? Or is something deadly brewing underneath  ? Assuming cases explode putting our hospitals under stress and some of our aged relatives will be denied healthcare or left to die, is there anything medically we can do at home about conditions like pneumonia to ease their suffering and perhaps give them a chance to recover? A very good evening Sir!  \\n\\nJust a few questions:\\n\\n1.\\t **Can teenagers get sick?** The Chinese data shows that only 2.1% cases in China were of people below the age of 19. They can transmit disease but not get sick. \\n\\n2.\\tAs we know that the government is not allowing tests for people without travelling history. **What to do if we feel like we’re having symptoms?**\\n\\n3.\\t**What’s the best protection an individual can have?** N95 masks aren’t available, I have a few surgical masks (heard they’re of a little help), hand sanitizer, and that’s pretty much it. How much in danger are the medical staff who are testing and treating the patient who unknowingly goes for common cold treatment, but may have been infected with the coronavirus? What steps can be taken to mitigate the risk? Hi since yesterday I have sneezing, a throat and ear pain, slight trouble breathing, congestion in the lungs, heavy mucous discharge, headache, slight body ache, but no fever yet. Visited a local clinic doctor today who says it\\'s just a throat infection and asked me to do gargles and...that\\'s it. He even discouraged me from wearing a mask. I live alone and I\\'ve isolated myself now. Is there any symptoms that I should be on the lookout for? At what point should I seek a hospital or testing facility? I should mention that the city I\\'m in, Bangalore, currently has some small scale H1N1, Bird Flu and Cholera outbreaks as well. Why are they not testing people showing symptoms but haven\\'t been abroad, or in contact with someone abroad recently?\\n\\nSeeing how minimal the testing is, do you expect it to blow up the same way it has in European countries and US? Thank you for your service! How is your mental health right now? * How many medicines required for treating covid 19 are produced domestically? Is there any danger of medicine shortage?\\n\\n* Should the government be enforcing a total 100% lockdown coupled with mass testing similar to china?\\n\\n\\n* How can ordinary people help doctors and nurses in this crisis. What can do or not do to make their work easier? Given how hi-tech private hospitals like Kokilaben, Hinduja, Apollo, Fortis, Jupiter are why can\\'t government help set up Bio-Level 4 labs in them to add more testing centres?!\\n\\nHaving 1 testing centre in Mumbai, a city of 25 million, is a death sentence for many. In your best of knowledge, how much is government paying heed to WHO\\'s call of \\'test, test, test\\'? Are we even equipped to increase the number of testing if we want to? What\\'s with the half life of this corona virus strain? Virus becomes active only in suitable host and it remain inactive otherwise but completely able to bounce back even after years. So how some  reports claiming its half life is in hours are calculating that? Hi Roshan am glad you took time to clarify or doubts How dangerous is it to fly domestically in India in 3 days time? Considering that I will be taking all necessary precautions(maintaining distance,mask, hand sanitizer) and not interacting with anyone? Only travelling because the reason to travel is really important. How do Asymptomatic cases spread the virus so much? If they don\\'t have a temperature and are not coughing, I would assume they won\\'t be spreading as much since the virus transfers through droplets. How well equipped is the Indian pharma industry to deal with a widespread outbreak? Are we likely to have shortages of medicine? Hi. MS patient here. Been on immunomodulatory drugs for 2 years. How does that change, if at all, my susceptibility to this virus?\\nEdit, 27 year old. Since age seems to play an important factor. Thank you for the AMA. Why do you think that there are so few cases thus far in India? Considering the size of the country and the population, the data looks terribly incongruous. Are there more people infected but simply haven\\'t been tested? Or have we just been lucky?\\n\\nGoing by [this site](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries):\\n\\nCountry\\t\\tTotal \\tNew\\n\\nAfghanistan\\t22\\t+1\\n\\nBangladesh\\t10\\t+2\\n\\nIndia \\t137\\t+8\\n\\nPakistan\\t236\\t+52\\n\\nSri Lanka\\t44\\t+16\\n\\nWe have had only 8 new cases in the last day while Pakistan and Sri Lanka have had 52 and 16 respectively. Can I find out if I have a fever without having access to a thermometer? How do you keep calm in an emergency situations as this and how risky is it for medical professionals while treating this disease? How can we urge the government to test everyone? Symptoms or not. Asymptomatic cases are the major cause of spread and this needs to be taken seriously. Also, community spread in a city like Mumbai or Delhi will be a nightmare. Any recommendations? Hi doctor. I would like to ask just why did you max out the beauty filter on your mobile camera? Like other viral diseases, like the viral fever we usually get, we are prescribed antibiotics and painkillers to manage the symptoms and let the body fight the virus. \\n\\nIn case of covid-19, would the same measure be taken? The only difference being we will be under quarantine given the high R-0 of the virus. How are YOU feeling today? I have a mild fever but not other symptoms. My fever broke yesterday. A family member just died and their funeral is Saturday. Am I safe to go if I wear a mask? How safe is domestic air travel with reasonable precautions? [deleted] Hi doc! How are people able to recover completely when there\\'s no cure for corona? Is there a way by which we don\\'t enter phase 3?\\n.... because I can see people are distancing themselves now to some extent and in the coming days will follow every regulations and guidelines (hope so). If a person is having only dry coughs(a little bit much) and no fever, it can be the symptoms or not? I am pregnant (first trimester).\\n\\nIf I come in contact with an infected person, how can it affect the baby if at all?  I  have seen multiple sources which report that hydroxychloroquine has  shown high effectiveness for covid-19 in China and S Korea. Why is this  not used everywhere? And if it is effective, why are there ppl still  dying? should I sell all my stock, underwear, and toilet paper? Since this is an AMA I’m curious what your thoughts on using skin whitening filters on photos are doc? There was a news recently that doctors in Rajasthan cured 3 Coronavirus patients with the help of Malaria, Swine flu and HIV medicines. What is your view on this? I don’t think my *primary medical system* here in **Himachal** can handle if the number of cases increase.. \\n\\nPlease let me know if a regular *exercise* would increase my chance of *survival*... \\n\\nOr I’ll be a **host** and have **asymptotic** condition lying on me ... Thanks for this AMA. \\n\\n1. Do you think we are testing enough people at present?\\n2. If not, do you think this is because we aren\\'t capable of testing more people or because the government doesn\\'t think it\\'s required?\\n3. How long do you think it\\'ll take for this pandemic to subside? A month? An year? Or will it continue until we have a vaccine? Do you think current ICMR guidelines are enough to provide a true picture. As we have seen, time is the key here. Are they saying n95 masks are not necessary due to shortage. Or do they really make no difference. Should I buy masks if I find them? If someone gets infected, got forbid, what precautionary steps should they or people around them should take?\\n\\nChange cloths? Call the 100? What should we do? The people who are affected of this virus. How are they  living? Is it painful? Are they conscious all the time? Do their color change?\\n\\nPeople in my city are still not taking this seriously, the roads are still filled with peoples\\n\\nMaybe If we show how people are suffering they’ll consider self distancing? [deleted] This might be a dumb question, but, is it bad to eat from restaurants etc. in this time. I\\'m talking about delivery mostly. Can people get infected again once they recover? Do you think private hospitals can make a difference if they are allowed to test? Thank you for your service, how can people support medical staff better? Are you an epidemiologist? In Delhi, schools, colleges etc. have been closed till the 31st of March. Do you think this is enough time or a delay is necessary? How are the hospitals preparing for the outbreak? Thank sir for make this honorable answers. You are a hero to all men. Is it safe to receive parcels from Amazon/flipcart( package are shipped within india only) Why are the cases so so low in India? With such dense population and bad hygiene the cases should be much higher? Should I go jogging early in the morning? I do this daily, there are not many people present in the streets at that time. Should I wear face masks if i go out. While traveling do handwashing with paper soap will work as affectively as a regular or Antibacterial soap ? Should N95 mask be used if someone is showing flu-like symptoms? Or will a normal surgical mask suffice? 1. Suppose one gets infected with Corona virus, please suggest top 5 things the person should do, to increase his chance of survival?\\n2. Which homemade things can be used as hand sanitiser or mask substitutes?\\n\\nThanks Which type of mask is most efficient in preventing the virus? Can being affected by Coronavirus lead to fluid in the lungs? Is diarrhea one of the symptoms of this disease? Do you think Indian government and it\\'s people are doing enough to \"flatten the curve\"? I see many of my friends chilling and hanging out as colleges have been closed. How harmful is this? Things that we can do to keep ourselves safe? Are there studies/indications that the virus might slow down it\\'s spread with rising temperatures? Why doesn\\'t every hospital create a route map for positive patients and put it out in the media? Can\\'t this be done parallely while investigating the patient for all contact places? Considering the number positive at 134, I find it baffling why this isn\\'t being done anywhere except Kerala Should I be scared that I\\'ll be easily affected by Covid-19 because I\\'ve kidney stones ? Is there any extra precaution I should take ? \\n\\n(I am drinking 2.5 litre water every day) I read that Zinc, Vitamin C and Vitamin D could be helpful to fight the infection. Is that true and should people start taking supplements? Will people deficient in vitamins have a harder time?\\n\\nAlso, thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. Yo doc, forget the corona virus, you gotta drop that skin care routine. Man got glow Do you think that the Beauty Filter was turned on in the above picture? 1. Given that the government has focused mainly on travel cases, what do you think a realistic number of positive cases in the country would be. I know it\\'s hard to project these things as they are highly speculative but do you think it\\'s in the 100s or 1000s or more?\\n\\n2. How long do you think it will take for ordinary life to stabilize in India?\\n\\n3. My organization has been slow to move into a work from home arrangement in Bangalore. I\\'m struggling at this point as I feel strongly that I shouldn\\'t have to go. What would you recommend for professionals in this situation? Human extinction ahead ! What does the future of this pandemic look like? As far as I\\'ve read we\\'re about a year to 18 months away from a vaccine/medicine to treat or prevent the infection, so what exactly is going to happen in the coming months? \\n\\nThis social distancing and quarantine we have got going on, how long will this last? I don\\'t think this quarantine setup can last more than 2-3 months, right? So what WILL happen and what SHOULD happen in the next few months? this ama was nice. Thanks to the doctor not being a govt bhakt..good job! Do you think the measures our government is taking currently enough to combat the spread? Or do you think we are treating this lightly?\\nAlso, thank you for your service. Do you think we need to learn from countries like Singapore where the contact tracing capabilities have put them in the front foot in controlling the spread in their countries. Doctor,\\nI have few doubts please try to clarify.\\nFew months back I have suffered with Dengue fever.\\nAnd recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism. How likely I\\'ll stand against corona virus?\\n(In general how likely people like us suffer with corona virus?) What is the procedure sir for getting the corona test can u tell us pls !? And that’s one way you shouldn’t be wearing a mask . Is there any planning being done in your hospital? Are they planning for protection of staff, families and how to handle extreme cases? Hi Doc, and thanks for doing this. \\n\\nIf, let’s say, we assume community transmission. Is there a graph that can help us understand/project the next 1/2 months? Is sanitizer enough as a precaution because corona is a virus and i dint think sanitizer are able to effect viruses ?  Help i am dumb I heard in a news report that private labs are going to be authorised to conduct Covid-19 tests in India. Is this true? Do you think that\\'ll increase the number of Covid-19 tests to a level that\\'ll actually help the case in our country? When will all this subside? I\\'ve read that this is the starting phase of a pandemic, so what could be the worst case scenario here?\\n\\nHope this helps Hi doc, what can India do to stop the spread reaching phase 3? - Are people who covid-19 once immune to it? If they get it again, will the symptoms and risks be stronger or weaker?\\n- Does eating citrus fruits help build immunity immediately for this situation or does immunity building take more time? Is India testing enough people to be sure that we are safe? Why is the mortality rate so high in Italy as compared to other countries? Do you think this could happen in India as well? How difficult is it to get more kits? Is there anything stopping the government from getting more kits? Are they prohibitively expensive? Do we have to import them? Can we manufacture them in India?\\n\\nSorry for so many questions :) If someone is sick and goes to a doctor for a check how long does it take to know if they are positive or not Thank you for your time. Went through all your responses. Some of the other members had already posted the questions I had in mind. Thank you very much to you all in the medical field for your service and sacrifice. What to do about office goers which travel regularly to gurugram through metro Hello doc\\n\\nI have seen you and other people talk about diffrent phases of the disease can you explain all the type of phases Hi, thanks alot for your service, hope we all get through this situation well and fine :) Can u explain the symptoms in stages(days) , it will be very helpfull ? Will the situation from now onwards get better or will it get worse? I have been trying to find an answer to this but haven\\'t been able to. Please ignore if it seems off-topic. My question is if Viruses need a host to survive and everyone is healthy and unaffected (maybe when everyone has recovered after a spread), do they go extinct? How would covid 19 affect cigarette smokers and marijuana users? What about kids with pre existing Asthma conditions? Are they at a greater risk? [SARS-CoV-2 Testing Methods](https://i.imgur.com/XD2ZKrl.png)\\n\\nWhich are the ones among these being used in India?? How long will it take a person gets cured from the virus once symptoms start showing? Is it true that scorching sun will stop the spread of virus? Can pets and animals be affected by the coronavirus?\\n\\nHow does one maintain animals in the house wrt hygiene. I am currently living in a Tier-3 town and in a state with zero corona cases so far. How serious do you think it is for people in small towns and villages ? What precautions should they take? I have dust and other related allergies and hence have hyperimmunity, how will coronavirus affect me? Sir! What do you estimate the actual extent of covid-19 infection to be in India?\\nSince a lot of people have not undergone tests; and many more are just using the quarantine to go on vacations and stuff. Hey doctor! I’m 22M and a kidney transplant person. I’m on immunosuppression. Do I have high probability of dying if I catch Coronavirus? What is the procedure for testing for COVID-19?\\n\\nAnd when they say \\'kits\\' do they specifically mean that a single-use package exists that doctors use to test for this virus and we have a limited number of it, it is a proper machine or something?\\n\\nAlso, thanks a lot for your help. I have friends and people I consider family in a small, rural village in Rajasthan. Though I feel they may be less likely to encounter this virus, what advice do you have for people living in rural communities with poor access to facilities like hospitals and medical centres, and where literacy levels are much lower than in cities? Are there websites where the information is given in Hindi? \\n\\nIt’s also worth mentioning about half the men in this community work in nearby mines where they come into regular contact with foreign workers. Can this virus be more dangerous for person with asthma history? Doctor, is the advice here right?\\n\\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1xXEEgtPULOAGDT2VRNX4n0he8Vwstvkr/view Good evening Dr. \\n\\nI\\'m curious to know if pulmonary kochs drugs will help CoVid 19 as both is affecting the lungs.\\n\\nThanks. So for someone, who do not show the symptoms, how long does the virus stay inside? Do these guys should be treated as well? No questions as many people have already done that. I just hope you and other medical staff is safe during the whole thing. Thank you for your services :-) A conspiracy theories goes like its America\\'s biological war gone too far. Your thoughts? [deleted] Hi im a type two diabetic. 28 yrs. Is this going to be more difficult for me? Why are we taking so much time to give the test results whereas countries like South Korea etc can test it in a few hours?  Can\\'t we just copy them? Ive heard there\\'s no treatment, so does the body heals itself? How much time will it take to recover if you are healthy but infected with coronavirus? As a biotech student, do you know any sources that mention the physiology of how the virus is infects and the studies performed to find the right medicine for the cure?? I was reading a pre print research paper from some chinese researchers who claim to have found a correlation between blood groups(antigens) and their susceptibility to COVID-19.\\n\\nCan there be any relation between the two? Should I stop going to work even if the consequence would be that I lose my job? [deleted] I\\'m still going to office for some crucial work that can\\'t be done from home yet (will be over in a day or two). I\\'m taking ubers both ways (wearing mask), not touching the phone, and cleaning my hands with sanitizer as soon as I get off the car. I also keep the windows open to ensure that the air is circulating, and keep an eye on the driver if he\\'s showing any signs.\\n\\n\\nAm I in serious risk right now? Can I hold off for a day or two more? Is it safe to eat food ordered via swiggy or zomato? I usually order food throw away packaging asap, wash my hand with dettol for 20 seconds, and finally, begin to devour my food. Is it safe? I am afraid I interacted with someone who seemed sick but wasn’t coughing or anything remotely close to showing symptoms. He simply said he didn’t feel good. \\n\\nWhat should I do? Wait for symptoms to show in me? Should I get tested ASAP? I am working in a public sector bank,its too crowded. How to take precaution at such a crowded place? Hello sir, I heard that Soap and Water is more effective that using Hand sanitizer as preventive measure from Coronavirus. Is that true?\\n\\nAlso, Just generally, Are Sanitizer that useful as they are marketed?\\n\\nOne of my friend gave this scientific explanation behind the claim:\\n\\nCoronavirus is an \"enveloped\" virus, which means that it has an outer lipid (fat) membrane layer. Basically, it\\'s surrounded by a fat layer. And soap (plus any other detergent, so your dish washing liquid as well) is amazing at dissolving fats, which means that it will basically... explode the virus. There is no need to switch / stock up on sanitizers, normal detergents and soaps are enough.\\n\\nAlso, can you please suggest any good product to sanitize product bought from outside or even for mobile phone and laptops? [deleted] Is there any evidence to show that if you get the virus and recover you would be immune to it? Or that it is less likely to be contracted again. Thanks for the AMA Doc, how likely are the patients that recovered from the virus to get it again meaning not from external stimuli but I heard there have been cases that people get it again even they are recovered. How many months do you think it will take until the pandemic becomes manageable,ie things go back to some semblance of normal? Is it possible that the spread dies down in phase 2 (irrespective of coronavirus scenario) Thank you for all the good work doc! What are the chances of self recovery for a coronavirus suffering patient? Let\\'s say you get infected. You\\'re showing symptoms but you don\\'t have proper access to health care. Since there is no present cure for it except to relieve the symptoms, what are the odds of a person recovering? Does the disease regress on its own after a given amount of time or does it give rise to new complications apart from respiratory problems? I am from Mumbai i am very scared due to dense population here , What precaution should i take for myself and family for maximum safety ? Do you foresee a shortage in groceries and household essentials? Do eating food like almonds cashew etc boost immunity against viral diseases? Let\\'s say this does become a community outbreak - how much different will it be from the common cold virus which lakhs get each year? I\\'m asking because I feel we are trying to avert the inevitable. This is going to become as common as the flu virus from next year, and we can\\'t keep shutting down entire countries because of this. We should rather be preparing for this to become a common virus. So when it does become a common disease, how dangerous is it on a scale of 1 to 10? Because the reactions right now range from \"meh, we\\'ll be fine, we\\'ll just catch a cold\" to \"oh my gaawwdd it\\'s the zombie apocalypse and we\\'re all gonna dieee!\" I\\'m not even sure what to believe anymore. Indian immunity: Yes; No; Maybe ? Of I got infected with coronavirus. Can I become healthy without any medical help? My age is 20 and I have cough from 1 week. Not other symptoms only cough. Do you think a teenager with asthma needs to check and self quarantine regardless of his present condition?? I know this is an absurd request since I don\\'t think health professionals will have time but a small but recurring and progressive AMA will help us to understand and forecast situation over time. My office won\\'t allow me to work from home or a holiday,  how to keep myself safe? How likely is the virus to be eradicated by the heat during the summers? Hi doctor,\\n\\nWould taking the flu shot be of help to elderly (60+ folks)? how long do you think schools and colleges will remain closed in india? Hi Doc, so good to see you here. I am a US citizen, wife is Indian, but residents of US, both in our early 30s, and currently visiting her family (and isolating) in India. We have a flight scheduled this Friday heading to New York, nonstop. Seeing as how you believe Phase 3 in India is forthcoming, would it be prudent to head back to New York on Friday (armed with N95, sanitizer) or delay our return for a few weeks (if needed, we could stay in India ~5 months if needed) and see how things develop? As you know, NYC is not in good shape at the moment, so we\\'re hesitant with both options. Thanks very much. There are a lot of samples being negative even for the primary contacts of the infected. What is your take on this? Was this also the case in other countries where things have now become worse?\\nThank you Very important question:\\n\\nIf a person gets it once, will he get it again??\\n\\nCan it pass from pets to humans.  2 scenarios - \\n\\n   i. does a dog get one and then can he transmit to humans\\n\\n   ii. if a dog licks a person who has corona and then licks another persons hands, who then touches his mouth does it transmit. How long do you reckon it\\'ll be till the worst is behind us? All the countries say that, testing kits are scarce. Is that a problem now or will it become one?( In India) Also, what can we do for more testing kits. \\'Cause I believe preventing the spread and ***\"flattening the curve\"*** is the most important thing rn. Amazing skin! Secret? When will the self isolation and panic end? What are the means to end this pandemic? Is it true that hot weather will reduce the spread? Is there a way we can use the antibodies produced by the patients who have already recovered from the virus? Pretty late. Question might have been asked. How effective is isopropyl alcohol+aloevera gel to make sanitizer? Hello Sir, I am a student. I live in PG in Delhi.\\n Is it safe to be here or I should head to home(Jharkhand)? Q. How corona virus works when it enters our body ?          \\nQ. Does it also have mechanisms like reverse transcription and whether it is mutagenic or not?          \\nQ. If there\\'s a mutation due to several number of host will things get easier or worse for people working over medicines?                                                                              \\nQ.

Being a virus it is very small in size and the normal face mask can allow it to pass through are there any more ways to protect ourselves? ( Other than hand sanitizers).                                                                               \\nQ. Are there any memory cells produced after the primary response on corona virus patient after they healed. Does it helps them aquire Immunity to any further coronavirus infection.                                                   \\n                                                                                                \\nP.S : I am an aspiring Medical student and I like the mechanism of diseases specifically , how it functions , symptoms and medications etc. Thanks for giving your time for us. How do we sanitize objects to keep ourselves safe? Will dettol solution be sufficient? Sir, \\nI am a smoker, heard that smokers are in more danger zone than non-smokers. \\nShould quitting right now will have any effects?? And how much danger for smokers than non smokers? Do you use an \"Apple\" phone? DO YOU AGREEE THAT CORONA VIRUS IS A BETTER POPULATION CONTROL METHOD TAHN ANY METHOD ADOPTED TILL NOW? Are you aware that the mask you\\'re wearing is of no use. It should be at least n95 graded to provide any kind of safety against contracting this new virus.', ' What are the attitudes among your friends/family towards sunni, shia, sufi, ahmaddiya muslims? I love that there are two ex-muslims answering all the questions. I feel like we\\'re getting two AMAs in one post. Not complaining! As a strong supporter of secular politics, \\nAt times it’s difficult to see certain far-right attitude among the Muslim brethren.    \\nHow effective is rationalism in muslim community of India and what is its reach?    \\n    \\nI also have come across a fair share of atrocities against dalits by the Muslim community. What is the attitude among muslims about dalits? While growing up, did you face any discrimination in Schools, etc from your friends just because you were a Muslim? How will your family and friends react when they find out you no longer identify as muslim? Are you worried? Being a minority, do Muslim children get the feeling that they\\'re different from others, and maybe face difficulty adjusting? Does this impact their mental well being - and if so, how do they get support? Do children do better when they\\'re in a Muslim majority school or a mixed school? What are some things you feel a lot of non muslims dont know about muslims. Like, is it really religion first for most of them? From a purely academic/secular point of view, what do you think of Hinduism? I\\'m mainly curious to understand how Indian Muslims in general perceive the majority religion. I imagine most don\\'t think much about it. What is the attitude of your friends/family towards the Kashmir movement? Do they support it but do not speak out because of fear? Are they nationalistic? Can you name some people (historical or present day) that Muslims look up to or consider their role models? Which exmuslim Youtubers influenced you the most? For me it\\'s Apostate Prophet and Abdullah Sameer. What do you think of the Hijab? Did your opinion of homosexuality change after you left Islam? Hi. Another ex-muslim here.\\n\\nI never felt discriminated against growing up. Even now the only discrimination I have felt is on TOI comments and Twitter. \\n\\nThe reason I left religion is because I felt I was living a lie. I feel I should read up about other religions, especially Hinduism and it\\'s rich culture. How did you leave Islam? Was it a gradual journey or was there a Eureka moment? Did it affect you mentally? Some of the dalit bahujan pages I follow talk about the Ashraf-Syed (upper caste) vs the Pasmanda(lower caste) muslims. \\n\\nThey talk about how the Hindu-Muslim binary is created by Brahmins and Ashrafs to benefit themselves, and that the true source of conflict is not Hindu vs Muslim but Brahmin-Ashraf vs Bahujan-Pasmanda. Brahmins and Ashrafs are the ones with wealth and influence within their communities, the people who give speeches, but it is the bahujan pasmandas, the working classes, that die in riots, while the brahmin Ashrafs win seats in parliament. The Hindu-muslim binary is useful in ending any caste class consciousness that may arise among bahujan pasmandas. \\n\\nSo my question is - how relevant is caste among Indian Muslims? Is endogamy practiced in any form? (I\\'ve heard syeds used to only marry amongst themselves but now they marry other upper caste muslims as well - similar to how brahmins now marry baniyas as well)\\nIs there an overlap between these caste groups and wealth/income levels? why you left Islam? (please mention the details as I\\'m studying the religion myself)\\n\\nwould be your kindest of  favors  :D 1.) What are you now? different religion? atheist? agnostic? anti-theist?\\n\\n2.) Why did you leave islam? what caused all this?\\n\\n3.) On the scale of just \\'ex-muslim\\' and \\'Islam should be removed from the world\\', where are you?\\n\\n4.) In your opinion, who are the popular muslim figures who should be despised/criticized instead of being famous among muslims.\\n\\n5.) In your opinion, what are some big ills of muslim society.\\n\\n6.) What are your thoughts on the future of muslims world. What are some aspects of Islam that you really love? [deleted] me too ex-muslim , hello there ! * What is your opinion of prophet Muhammad? Hero, or villain?\\n* Suppose an ex-Muslim doesn\\'t believe in Islam, but is not an atheist. What options does he or she have for belief in an almighty?\\n* What specific aspects of Islam turned you off the religion (theologically or ethically)?\\n* Have you explored the \"gentler\" varieties of Islam, such as Sufism? Do you feel Quran is still viable even though Islam as an organized religion is dangerous?\\n\\nThe Quran mentions the New Testament. What are your thoughts about the New Testament?\\n\\nHere is a link I found:\\n\\n[https://answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/injil\\\\_what\\\\_kind.html](https://answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/injil_what_kind.html) I\\'m an ex hindu . \\n\\nI see you are a man of culture as well Hello, and thanks for doing this AMA!\\n\\nIn Hinduism, there are some people who claim their ancestors were Aryans, which is to say, not the inferior locals :-), and who feel pretty proud of themselves for that. What about among Muslims? Are there those who claim to be descended from Arabs/Turks etc and feel proud about that? Do the others in the community give them any extra respect for that?\\n\\nSecondly, among Muslims, in your experience, how literally do people take the fanciful stories? Eg the story that Muhammed travelled on a horse and went to heaven and came back. Is the story considered figurative or the literal truth? I think its great that you are critically examining your religious beliefs and the Quran. Its a step in becoming a more well-rounded and knowledgeable person. I agree with your point that there is no \"hard evidence\" of a lot of things that are mentioned in the holy books.\\n \\nHowever I am not convinced if they are to be taken literally and hence its a narrow view to subject them to scientific empiricism. Its not a scientific claim or experiment after all. Every story is open to interpretation, if it really happened or not to exact accuracy is irrelevant to most people.\\n\\n I believe there are a lot of moral lessons that can be derived from the stories of the Bible, Quran or any of the Hindu/Buddhist/Sikh and other religious mythologies and they can help you lead a life which is more rounded and in harmony with the society. I am not advocating for religion per se but just to take what you can from it and find your own path.\\n\\nOn that note would like to end with this debate (check link), Hasan is one of my favorite Muslim journalist and a lot of his moral courage comes from being a religious Muslim.\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/Jy9tNyp03M0 my english not so good please adjust, why you chose to give up islam can you tell , you thik india islam sufi one better than all the hardcoar wahabism one from middle east Full disclosure: I fully expected this thread to become a shit show, full with irrational Islamophobia. Thank fuck nothing like this happened.\\n\\nGood AMA by you two, or three, forgot. >We are not anti-Muslim, we just don\\'t believe Islam\\'s claims and feel Islam should be criticized like any other belief system.  \\n\\nWhy belief system and not religion?

This is very helpful in generating much needed engagement. Hi Srinivas, In your tweet thread [https://twitter.com/digitaldutta/status/1209029898695659521](https://twitter.com/digitaldutta/status/1209029898695659521) you talked about bio metrics being de-duplicated with UIDAI . Can you explain what this means and why it is needed ? Are you from Swecha group? There was a news back in the year that Aadhar Data is not secure enough.\\nAnd some french guy who also trolled TRAI chief.\\nMy question is, if aadhar is not secure then why emphasize on connecting it to every other thing that is secure. Like my PAN, my mobile number and even my Bank Deposits? There was an Aadhar card for some Dog. I have seen it in 2018.\\nHow? And Why?\\nHow is it possible and why was it not caught by the authorities before issuing the same? In your opinion,  will this NPR/NRC project result in gerrymandering like it happens in the US where parties draw and redraw constituency to favor the chances of their party winning ? Thanks a lot for doing this. My questions:\\n\\n1. While NPR is under citizenship act and Census under Census act, their data is being collected together. Can it be shared between the two? Is there a possibility of NPR data being used for delimitation given Census data\\'s privacy/anonymity clause? (as you hinted this this tweet) \\\\[ [https://twitter.com/digitaldutta/status/1209030276698931201](https://twitter.com/digitaldutta/status/1209030276698931201) \\\\]\\n2. How accurate are the EC\\'s \"voter list purification\" exercises? Do you know why do we have duplicates in voter list at all? Or is it just an excuse to delete voters who might not vote in favour?\\n3. Given BJP\\'s multiple lies and delays about NRC and rules to implement CAA, what do you think they really have in mind? How should the protesters go about it all? There are women in Shaheen bagh who are sitting outside for many days now. What should we aim to do here on and how do we do it? What is the difference between NPR by UPA and NPR by present government? why is it more dangerous now? I have two questions. \\n\\n1) How do you think the govt should balance between privacy and security? Both seem to be opposite to each other. If the govt wants to grant it\\'s citizens some privacy (both online and offline), then that can pose a security threat as they won\\'t be able to identify terrorists. If the govt want to tighten up the security by monitoring data (online surveillance) and putting surveillance cameras everywhere (offline surveillance), then that becomes a privacy nightmare for a citizen of a democratic country. So how should the govt balance Privacy and Security of it\\'s citizens?\\n\\n2) Related to this, what do you think about Data Protection Bill recently brought into the Parliament? It feels like the govt is focussing more on the Security aspect than Privacy (in the context I explained above). The bill was supposed to give more Privacy to citizens but it feels like the bill has gone in the opposite direction. What are your thoughts on both these questions? How can this NPR data along with Aadhar can be used for winning elections as you pointed once in your thread? In your article [https://thewire.in/tech/aadhaar-infra-npr-nrc](https://thewire.in/tech/aadhaar-infra-npr-nrc) you conclude that \"The government’s use of data to identify people and randomly create registries has created a multitude of problems.\\xa0 It is time they be put in check with the upcoming data protection bill.\\xa0\" Could you elaborate on what kinds of problems these are ?', \" Did mods verify? Basic question - How are you and your family? Do you have more appreciation of internet after this episode? Or has this forced digital detox, while highly inconvenient, made you appreciate offline life more- friends, relatives, physical activity, hobbies? How true are the claims that there has been not a single bullet fired since the announcement was made?\\nIs it true that no childen have been detained by the police?\\nAre emergency medical facilities available?\\nWhat is the situation on procuring the basic necessities like food materials?\\nDo you think that lifting the lockdown would result in violence? What can be done to diminish the unrest? How have Kashmiris taken to the splitting of most of the state into Ladakh, both in terms of impact it has on Kashmiri identity and more day to day stuff like administration, jobs and economy? Just curious as to what Kashmiri locals think about genocide on Pandits, ethnic cleansing, driving them out and looting their properties. It is no secret that locals to some extent collaborated with the militants as they saw the violence beneficial. Do you agree that these murderers should be brought to justice similar to how nazi war criminals hiding were hunted down and brought to courts? Would you and other Kashmiris like Kashmir to be like other Indian states? By other Indian states I mean no lockdown but also no special status. What do Kashmiri’s feel about the lockdown? Why is gustaba served last? I read your another comment, and want to follow up on it. You'll understand the political sensitivity of the issue, but what can Indian state do over time to make things better. Asking as this has to improve, Indian state is investing so much money, lives are being lost, and no one is happy with anything. Hi, Kashmiri here (not in Kashmir). I don't have any questions to ask, just wanted to say that I hope that you are your family are doing well. I see stuff on the news channels and I'm worried for my relatives there :( Firstly, thank you for doing this. I have a couple acquaintances in the valley but haven't been able to muster the courage to text them. No words can comfort them. I hope things get better soon.\\n\\nI am curious about the healthcare situation there?Earlier there were reports of life saving medicenes and critcal care equipment shortage. Is it any better now? \\n\\nAlso, how heavily is the military deployed there? As in are they at every street corner, every block? Have they cut off neighborhoods from each other? What are your day to day interactions with them like? Are they hostile towards the locals or indifferent? [deleted] Salam.. Don't want to ask you anything. Just want to say sorry. As an Indian and as a human being.\\n\\nI can't even begin to imagine what it must've been like for you guys for the last three months. I still, to this day, have not been able to contact my friends who live in an area called Bren Nishaat, if I recall correctly, in Srinagar. Not even a simple text exchange to ask how they and their families are.. And that alone is a huge indicator of just how badly wrong things have gone. \\n\\nMay Allah keep you safe and happy. As a Kashmiri, what is your personal preference? Would you like Kashmir to be with India, Pakistan, or stay independent ?\\nEdit: can you also share your religion for context?\\nEdit 2: What do other Kashmiri feel about this? Dapaan neth karen restore yakum decembar peth? beyi mah trayan rail ti yalle. Halaat che laegmet thoda  calm down gasni magar  meh basaan yi phaeri wapsi cxouri nai weryeh. Tohih kya basaan? What do Kashmiris want? Except for the removal of restrictions which I believe should happen asap and except reinstating 370 and 35a which the current government won't do? I don't want to get political but how as the sentiment changed towards the nation after the episode, you can ignore the question if you want. Just trying to understand what this has done in the minds of the people apart from the obvious. I personally think Kashmir should be made a independent entity with only foreign relations and defence being managed by the central government. This is to counter the threats from Pakistan and China. This would also mean Kashmiri's only enjoy the same privileges in rest of India that rest of India has in Kashmir. Do you think that'd be a better outcome for Kashmir? \\n\\nTBH I haven't seen a good argument for keeping article 370. Yes it ended special privileges that Kashmiri's enjoyed but the article itself has been so diluted it was hardly doing much. Apart from an emotional reasoning what is it that Kashmiri's oppose in removal of art 370. Assuming the lockdown didn't happen, cause that is terrible. What are your thoughts on Jammu and it's people? I see people/media mentioning about Kashmir a lot, but nothing on Jammu. u/bropunzal, in case you are still answering questions: firstly, glad you and your family are safe and as well as can be, in the circumstances. Hope things improve soon, for Kashmir's sake and for India's sake.\\n\\nMy question is this: you have mentioned several times that you fear the intention of the state is to carry out a mass genocide of kashmiri muslims. Why do you think so? My own sense is that the govt doesn't trust that Kashmiris won't choose Pak/independence if they had the option, so it suppresses them with a very heavy hand.  This leads to military rule, firing with live rounds, and custodial killing, but that is very different from a genocide. I think the Indian state, horrible as it is in so many ways, does not have the desire (forget the capacity) to do something as evil as that. What reasons make you certain?\\n\\nSecond: I think the govt's best-case scenario is that somewhat like the Khalistan movement in Punjab or ULFA in Assam or the Mizo movement in Mizoram, Kashmiris will eventually come around. Clearly you believe that is not going to be the case. Why? Do you think it is at all possible that if the govt uses heavy military force to achieve superficial peace, allowing Kashmir to develop and achieve greater prosperity, Kashmiris will eventually find that staying within India is not too bad?\\n\\nAnother question: Given that the Indian state is not going to allow Kashmir independence or even autonomy, what is the best possible outcome that you see happening? If you had a chance to address all fellow Kashmiris, what would you counsel? Azadi at any cost? Keep your head down and carry on, one day we will get them? Or Lets give India (yet) another chance, they are the least worse option? Or something else?\\n\\nSorry for so many questions, I couldn't stop at one! Namaskar Mahrah, Tvaahi kaatika jhu? Anatnag?\\n\\nIt is also important for Indian redditors to know this AMA is from a Kashmiri Muslim, they do not speak for Hindus like myself.  Kashmiri Hindus are like 100% with India, and we are thankful for the Jawans here. \\n\\nOne thing I would say is the Indian Government made mistake by allowing paltry access to landlines during initial days. Talking one minute with family isn't enough, I didn't know anything about my family for a while.  It is a better situation now, but now optimal. India needs to normalize everything sooner better than later, \\n\\nSituation will get better and hopefully peace and prosperity will return to the region. Is it safe to travel there with family? If yes please suggest some good peaceful places near mountains Assuming independence isn't feasible, why do you guys wish to join Pakistan over India? Hi! Thank you for doing this.\\n\\nI have a couple of questions regarding Kashmir. \\n\\n1. What's the general opinion in Kashmir about their identity as Indians? I recently learned that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is called Aazad Kashmir by lots of people.\\n\\n2. While the current situation is absolutely dire (not that it ever was normal with the army being there all the time), are there people who believe the removal of Section 370 can lead to a better future eventually?\\n\\nAgain, thank you so much for doing this. There was a panel in my university about Kashmir, and we had a Kashmiri speak about life growing up there. I can't even begin to fathom how daily shootings have turned into normalcy for the area.\\nI don't know how things can ever be peaceful, and life can be actually normal there. Hmm, in your opinion, what has Article 370 changed for a common man in Kashmir? There are claims being made that 'grass root' people aka not privileged like upper middle class, are happy that state became UT because now central govt can build metro/flyovers without having to go through the state.\\n\\nHonestly, state govts don't do shit and do you think that this will be that one good thing for Kashmir? Its good to know you are doing ok. Just keep holding on and I believe everything would be fine. If things go bad always remember there are people who will help. Always. Just keep hanging there bud. Hi, good to know you're safe. \\n\\nI read you want Kashmir to go back to its autonomous state. My question is, it's been that way for the past several years, but only thing that's increased is the militancy. Also, if you were to go to Pakistan, only thing you guys would have in common with them is the religion, but Pakistanis kashmiris are having it worse, they aren't happy there. So why do you want things to go back to as they were before? \\n\\nAlso, stay safe. Cheers. Sorry for what you guys are going through. \\nHope normalcy returns to you soon and bigotry doesn’t affect you.\\n\\nI wish people learnt history and not cherrypicked only select events. And even if they did, that “revenge” is not the same as “justice”. Hello.\\n\\nWhat is the situation like for forest covers in Kashmir? How is the environment doing after years of occupation? Is clean water easy to access everywhere at the moment? \\n\\nSo you have migrant farm labor from the subcontinent? Or have they returned? Harvest season cannot have been easy, I'm sorry. Sorry, if this is rude. But based on what you feel, how many Kashmiris would want J&K to be a normal state in India, how many want to join Pak and how many want it to be a third country? [deleted] What can I do to end the lock down? BTW you are from  which district in Kashmir?\\n\\nAlso after the 370 removal if there was no lock down wouldn't more people would have been killed in the violence? If I remember correctly 50+ people were killed after Burhan Wani was killed.\\n\\nThe lock-down is pretty bad and I don't endorse it but if there was no lock-down, much more life would have been lost.Honestly I'm so confused about the whole thing! I think the reason why this is happening is because India doesn't want to give any more 'gifts'(can't think of a better word) to Pakistan. J&K is an important land and people living their won't be given any freedom. You all are just under crossfire between two nuclear powers. Both of them fighting for religious beliefs which is stupid. All I can say is migrate to other countries and leave your home because at the end of the day even I don't think about what conditions you are going through. I have never experienced what you have (and don't want to) and I hate religions. The only religion I believe is survival. Survival at all cost. Well my point is just make sure you survive and help many people survive along with you. J&k will take decades to regain freedom and you don't have that. Its unfortunate to see any effective action from the world community. Imagine if this happens in Europe, they would have quick to change the regime. When 70 % population supports terrorists  government have to take measures. my uncle is deployed in kashmir he say mentality of kashmiri people is of terror. Imo it's good to keep control I am not fully aware of all intricacies (political, historical etc) but full integration is beneficial for J&k, at least in the long run. Why are kashmir people against it? Muslim or Hindu? are you muslim or non-muslim? So in your opinion we let them what they want to do\", '', \" This should be interesting. Thanks for the heads up.

I just don't understand why would Sena protest against selling fish and most definitely it is not considered haram in Maharashtrian families maybe strictly vegetarian will not eat it. But most non-veg Marathi families eat fish. >The next morning, as soon as the shutters were raised, within literally seconds, about 100 beggars began banging on the glass window panes demanding food.\\n\\nBelieve me there used to be a time when people from Inorbit, Vashi could be seen dashing all the way to local station with their McD coke to avoid beggars 😂\\n\\n\\nMan this was an interesting Sunday read.

No questions here , but I thoroughly enjoyed your write-up and the humour! Have a great weekend 👍 Did you ever spit in someone's food ?\\n\\n\\nSlim shady Fake post. Something akin to a writers fantasy. You said marathi people asked you to stop selling fishes in mumbai.  I cannot believe that all. Half the Mumbai marathi population is from konkan where fishes are staple. Mumbai itself has roots in a fishing village and shiv sena half of whom are from konkan themselves asking you to stop selling fish what bullshit. I went to the McDonald's outside vt station the day it opened. It seemed super expensive back then. The outside seating was great. I received excellent service and I even filling out a feedback form. Why won't the foods get spoiled? Some things that sound fake to me:\\n\\n1. Shiv Sena opposing fish - like others have stated, Shiv Sena have never really had a stance opposing meat or beef (Correct me if I am wrong). In fact, they had flouted government orders and sold meant/fish when it was banned for Jain festivals\\n2. Woman throws coke at employee and walks away with 1000 Rs voucher - again, I can believe people being rude and still being placated by manager, but, an actual act of aggression like throwing drink at the guy in counter and getting away sounds far-fetched. I am not defending any caste here, but even people of lower caste treat people in retail shitty. In India no one cares about respect for a fellow human, If they are paying you or buying your stuff you are their slave. Upper caste or lower caste, PhD or 10th pass they all behave the same in this shit country. This is darn funny. Usually well off kids in India don't do part time jobs, it's sad, it's because of the class perceptions.

For some it may be just a job. For others it may be a stepping stone to something altogether different. > The first hour was spent preparing the store for the onslaught of the McDonald’s-craving indian junta many of whom were **sinister vegetarians**. I say sinister because if these people had their way, they would crucify anyone who ate meat. Since they could not do this, they resorted to making a nuisance of themselves everywhere they went. At home, they thought nothing of abusing the labour of a lower-caste servant and would force said servant to eat and drink from separate utensils. Anything that came into contact with a meat-eater was deemed to have been defiled and must be purified by magic incantations and ritual cleansing with water. These same people once called the police because my family was cooking fish. The irony of eating food at a restaurant that also served chicken was lost on them but that’s **partly because they love the gora and anything that the gora sells to them**.\\n\\nNicely worded !

He has said that he will impose CAA here, 100 percent.\\n\\nFurther this comes from the CM who also says that - so far, he did not know that there were protestors at Townhall.

I know the that North East was protesting before hand, but people in power don\\'t care about the protest there as the media only pays those protests lip service. With the protests in delhi, every channel HAD to cover them. The govt. was easily able to arm twist a bunch of parties in the Rajya sabha to get this bill through. Maybe if these street protests in the capital had happened earlier, it would have been more difficult to get this through RS? Needed clarification on something. Bharat Sharma, this ABVP volunteer was identified in both Jamia clash and the DU clash. He was working along with the police and was seen beating students along with the police. Isn\\'t this illegal? And can this be considered to be our first clue that the Police and the BJP (ABVP) were involved in this together to an extent that intruding in Jamia and causing all that ruckus was planned beforehand?\\n\\n\\nPs- I really need to report this, and want media to give attention to this.

Shashi Tharoor was spot on when he earlier said that India is turning into a \\' Hindu Pakistan \\'. I know that a lot of Gujarat is pro-Modi but I’d be willing to participate if some protests are organised in Surat. Government has crossed a line.

This combo is persecuting muslims in our own country. \\n\\nThis bill will not prevail. This will be BJP’s Doom. Now that the CAB has passed and Assam is burning in protests, isn’t it inevitable that secessionists will make a major comeback in the Assam? After all, whatever little trust the average Assamese had in the Indian government is probably gone now(especially as the BJP just broke a portion of the Assam Accord by giving Bangladeshi Hindus citizenship), so won’t many of them feel like the only way to have their demands met is by forming a new country? As an outsider who\\'s not really been following this story, can anyone explain why the CAB was passed?

Every politician is greedy for something. Modi is greedy for power and legacy. He wants to be known as the messiah for Hindus. With him getting so much negative coverage and Hindu youths joining the protest, the legacy is under some danger. The older folks in urban hindu belts would definitely support the bill, but I am pretty sure Modi\\'s team is calculating if that is enough population or not. Elections are a good indicator too. If they lose both Delhi and Bihar elections next year, it will be a big jolt. The bill is timed perfectly to grant citizenship to immigrants before west Bengal and assam elections in 2021.

(This will include register preparation by government workers, database, IT, peacekeeping by police and army, etc.) \\n\\n2) How much time and manpower will be required to then reinstate citizenship through CAB?\\n\\n3) How much time and money will be spent on average by a citizen on NRC and then further on CAB? \\n\\n4) How much estimated added burden this activity will put on our already overloaded judiciary, and subsequently the affect it will have on other cases (existing & new) - basically what effect cab + nrc cases will have on the time taken to achieve a resolution on other cases? If say the time to arrive at a judicial resolution goes up by 20% because of this, we\\'ll have to pay the judiciary 20% more to do the same job. \\n\\n5) Then we need to add all of these numbers up and this will be the cost of doing nrc + cab. It will come out of our budget and out of our gdp. \\n\\n6) Finally we need to estimate the number of actual illegal immigrants - if the money spent on the illegal immigrants is less than the money spent on conducting NRC + CAB, not only does it make zero sense to implement it on a moral basis, but also on an economical basis. \\n\\nIf we can do this activity, it will add a whole lot of weight to our arguments.

Just got an SMS from jio that internet services are gonna be suspended in my area (gzb) till the next directions by the govt. Clarification Required\\n\\nI’m observing the anti CAA-NRC protests worldwide through reddit and other social media. I myself went for a protest yesterday near KMC Hogg market, Kolkata. But today I was watching a few news channels, the likes of Republic TV, Times Now, ABP Hindi, India TV etc- they are saying that “CAB is to give citizenship, not to take away citizenship”. They even show Amit Shah telling the same. So, my question is, if the BJP government plans not to strip citizenship from any Indian, then how will they determine and locate those people who are from Afghan, Bang, Pak who came before 2014. Or do those people need to apply separately? Also, later if NRC is carried out nationwide, my question is, what is the purpose of spending thousands of crores of rupees just to find a few people who are from the said countries and give citizenship. I mean , isn’t there already a process present for refugees to apply for citizenship; can’t they not follow that process. Also, the NRC exercise in Assam proved to be a huge failure along with demonisation, make in India, digital India and what not initiative started by BJP govt. Why don’t they use that money for better healthcare, safety of women, employment, education, cleanliness and the general economy of India. Yesterday morning I went to bazaar and onion is 140rs a kilo( that also the rotten ones). Can’t the bjp govt see these as immediate problems which need attention or have Modi and Shah grown cataract in their corneas. \\nMy last question is related to the media. Why are majority of the media houses leaning towards BJP CAB NRC and showing the protesters as evil and all as propaganda by the opposition. Why can’t they be neutral? Heck , don’t they even see that CAB itself is unconstitutional and religion biased? Speaking of religion, how can BJP govt find out who belongs to which religion? In my documents issued by the govt there is no mention of religion. I however have my Baptism and other certificates issued by my Parish which shows that in a Christian. Do Hindus Sikhs and other religious communities have any said documents or will the BJP govt determine religion based on the name. If someone can shed some light on these please...

Really shocking watching school bus being stoned ,thank God driver saved the kids.this protest is being used to incite communal violence.I only fear if the kids were killed we would have riots. [deleted] A genuine question: We are saying that after the NRC, non-Muslims deemed \"illegal immigrants\" will get Indian citizenship under the CAA, but will Muslims deemed \"illegal immigrants\" also get it under the original Citizenship Act, 1955, provided they have stayed in India for at least 11 years?\\n\\nEdit: Finally got it. No illegal immigrant can apply for citizenship under the Citizenship Act 1955. CAA legitimizes non-Muslims and they don\\'t remain illegal immigrants anymore, and they can then apply for Indian citizenship. However, Muslims will be tried for entering India illegally and sent to detainment because they will be treated as illegal immigrants. There\\'s still a small part of cynical me that hopes for our media to finally, just for once speak out against our supreme leader.

I\\'m gonna go and shout out loud come the 19th, but deep within l know well that it could mean for nothing if all the middle aged and older folks continue to watch the same TV channels when the rest of us protest for what\\'s truly required in standing up to a fascist state.\\n\\nOne can hope - for a day - when if you spoke the truth, you wouldn\\'t be branded a protester/a Muslim apologist/ antinational/or a leftist even.\\n\\nTruth is the center.

I am not a lawyer. But i was attempting to read the new amendments along with the original bill. This bill may have unintended consequences on the citizens of India depending on how stringent is the criteria to prove your connection to these 3 countries. I will explain. (Lawyers, please correct me. Even i am trying to understand this. But this is my understanding so far).\\n\\nWill it have any effect on Indians or not can be determined only by how much is the weight on proving that you are from these three countries. Because a lot depends on that. \\n\\n\\nIs the passport of old country mandatory? Or Is affidavit sufficient if the old passport is lost or never held. If we don\\'t put weight on proving that, then  the criteria of these three countries is completely watered down. \\n\\nIf not, then that means even Hindu who cannot prove themselves in NRC and still have to produce some proof of them coming from these three countries (like an old passport or residential proof from the old place.. something). In which case even Hindus should be getting all worried at this point about NRC. \\n\\nBecause for the section under citizen by birth and citizen by naturalization, it needs the parent and the person to be not an illegal migrant.\\n\\nQuoting from original bill: \"1[[3.]\\xa0Citizenship by birth.—\\n\\n[(1)]\\xa0Except as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,—\\n\\n[(a)]on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;\\n\\n[(b)]\\xa0on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;\\n\\n[(c)]\\xa0on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where—\\n\\n[(i)]both of his parents are citizens of India; or\\n\\n[(ii)]one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, shall be a citizen of India by birth.\\n\\nSo, for those who are born after 2003, one has to prove that both parents are not illegal. Even if one parent is not able to prove then the child born will be deemed illegal too. \\n\\nThe new amendment Bill deems Hindus+from these three country+was here before 2014 to stop being illegal. So they can avail naturalization route.\\n\\nSo now it depends on what proof is to be required to show my connection to these three countries.. that information is not spelt out in this bill. \\n\\nGosh, this will be a nightmare in any case because:\\n 1. If affidavit allowed, it\\'s grossly divisive. All Hindus can just put affidavit that my father came from these 3, we lost our doc etc.. muslims still considered illegal. So naturalization route is not open for them. Pronto detention.\\n\\n 2. If affidavit not allowed and more proof needed, it fucks everyone. So less divisive but still fucked up because if i cant find my father\\'s birth certificate or his name on electoral rolls, he cannot prove his citizenship and then even if i am born in India, i will still be counted illegal. \\n\\nBut isn\\'t this a very thin criteria to walk on? And if it\\'s not spelt out in the bill, tomorrow a circular can be passed giving exemptions of proof for those who lost their old passport while coming to India. This will likely happen if Hindus on large scale are not able to prove in NRC.  Toh poora argument vahi khatam.  Can citizenshipbill  stand legal on such flimsy criteria. \\n\\nDo let me know if i have made errors in understanding this. As i said, NAL. Trying to read this correctly is all.

Their inability to prove Indian citizenship doesn\\'t prove their Pakistani/Bangladeshi citizenship, does it?\\n\\nWhy will Bangladesh or Pakistan accept these people as their citizens? Does the Indian government have any agreement with Bangladesh/Pakistan governments on this matter? Dumb question here: how does a non Muslim who\\'s lived in India all their life benefit under CAB if it\\'s only applicable for people from three countries? My post got removed abd I was told to pist it as a comment here. For background, im indian Muslim.\\n\\n>I\\'ve been following CAA and NRC closely mostly because I\\'m Muslim and my family up until my dad (both my mum and dad are born after 1978) was in a rural backward and poor area and naturally we dont have any certificates of our grandparents.\\n\\n>So, as per all the news in getting from media, I\\'ll be asked to prove my citizenship through any certificate dating back prior to 1970s which I\\'ll surely cant produce.\\n\\n>But according to citizenship rule for immigrants, my family will only need to show that we have been staying in india for 11+1 years (I can use graduation certificates of my parents or my own birth certificate) and then we can get in line to get permanent citizenship.

Can the current government be overthrown? I know how a coalition government can be dissolved but how do you break a government with majority in parliament in India? This is exactly what the government hoped for. This is the right wing playbook for decades. Look at any Hindu-Muslim riots in the past 20-30 years and you will find the pattern. First, attack a community the sanghis have an issue with, directly or through the state agencies, and when a reaction happens they will go on about how the community is violent and lets crackdown on them. They did this with dalits in Maharashtra during the Bhima-Koregaon protests and now the same will be done to the muslim community in Jamia. I can assure you that the narrative that will percolate to their votebank in their media ecosystem will be, \" look at these violent muslims. Aren\\'t you happy we are protecting you by getting CAB passed and getting this violent community in line?\" and poof, the little doubt the andh bhakts had in their mind about the Act will disappear. \\n\\nDo NOT fall in their trap by resorting to violence. Do not give them fodder. They are in power and will use it effectively. Play to your strengths and not to theirs. Protest peacefully and daily. Jeena haraam karo saalo ka. Roz utro sadak pe.

Objectively speaking why would anyone want to attract that kind of threat to oneself?\\n\\nThey are probably not the ones to blame but it is the society that we have created where there is no room for freedom of speech, no room for a healthy conversation, no room for any sort of a respectful debate.\\n\\nAnd why just point out Bollywood actors, cricketers don\\'t say shit, notable businessmen don\\'t say shit, other athletes don\\'t say shit and so on and so forth.\\n\\nEdit: typo # Isn\\'t this what they wanted?\\nThey wanted the Janta to focus more on Hindu-Muslim religious issue so that they can distract us from\\n\\n- \"hamare ghar me kanda lehsun nahi khate to mujhe price se farak nahi padta\"\\n- \"millenials are taking ola-uber instead of taking loans for new vehicles that\\'s why Auto-industry is not flourishing\"\\n- \"Rahul Gandhi (pappu) has welcomed rapists to rape all the women in India\" where as her own party contains Chinmayanand, MJ Akbar, Sunil Sehegar (sorry I didn\\'t remember the last name correctly)\\n\\nThis is what puzzles me where were this students, social communities, good citizens \\n- when GDP per capita was decreasing or - education was getting costly or \\n- people over 23 of age were sitting at home without jobs even after applying and trying hard \\n- when Taxes were literally shutting down many small clothes, plastic, cosmetic, etc kind of shops.\\n\\nThey really know that only religious and/or communal issues gets us out of our houses and we are literally being played that way.

It\\'s beyond my understanding why people are failing to see through this simple fact that the current Home Minister is a history sheeter. No amount of justification in favor of NRC-CAB is going to alter the fact that the premise of this bill is to alienate Muslims and any form of uprising(even the peaceful ones) against it will be met with severe actions by the police and other administrative bodies reporting directly to the HM. These actions would then be made to look rational by deliberately creating chaotic/violent scenarios followed by an Internet blackout.

What makes us secular is the fact that someone elses religion doesn\\'t affect how we view them, or we don\\'t try to convert or punish them for it, that we dont impose our religion on them. India under BJP is failing on both these accounts.\\n\\n\\nJust like an apple sticker doesnt make a Nokia an iPhone, having democracy or secular in a constitution isn\\'t what makes us those things.\\n\\nAs for people insisting, \"It isnt a religious, anti-Muslim thing\", remember that most racists don\\'t admit to being racist. They will find a way to say racist things and get away with it. I haven\\'t felt this kind of rage ever before AMIT SHAH - the plan is always simple. Get so dirty, so vicious, so obscene and so communal, that everyone is forced to talk about it. people have no time to talk about anything else....they dont talk schools, colleges, employment, but are shocked by the dirtiness to talk about communalism, hindu, muslim, secularism etc.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nso the conversation changes near to an election. and people have to pick sides. thats the only trick amit shah knows.

Just saw this protest tracking app, https://sehmati.com I suppose it’s natural to suspect bias when there is something or someone disagreeing. But as far as the CAA law is concerned, it doesn’t take a leftist or whatever to conclude it’s a communal piece of legislation. When a law excludes on the basis of religion, it’s plain and simple communal.

Dear All,  \\nPardon my ignorance but I have a few questions regarding the recent bill that was passed.If someone has any answers, or sources that I can refer to, please share them.\\n\\nSo just for a short premise, the bill states that it would be applicable to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014\\n\\nMy questions for this are:\\n\\n1. What document or evidence does the person need to present, to prove that he or she is part of one of those communities?\\n2. What document is required that he or she has come from one these countries only?\\n3. What document is needed to show when this person came to India, illegally or legally?\\n\\nAnother common narrative I see people sharing a lot is, that first the Govt. will run NRC through the country, and if you are a non Muslim who fails to show up documents, the CAA will save you. But if you are Muslim, you are screwed. (This can be false, but I see this being shared all over youtube and instagram)\\n\\n1. If a legal Indian citizen does not have sufficient documents to prove that he or she is Indian, how will they prove that they are in fact from Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan?\\n2. Is not too shady that someone first claims he is Indian and tries for NRC, then later claims that he is an immigrant and applies through CAA? Would this even be allowed?

India wants to stop any more people coming in by putting up controls \\n4. India wants to mark the existing population as legal or illegal and grant residency/citizenship only to those who came during to persecution back home.\\n\\nDoes the Constitution of India apply to anyone on Indian soil or Indian citizens? Because one could also make an argument if a foreigner delivers a child in India he should be a citizen since he is protected by the Indian constitution and granted all right by virtue of being born on indian soil.\\n\\nTerrorists/Mercenaries who cross over and are killed or kill others, are they also protected by the indian constitution because that would make the entire army a murderer?\\n\\nHow would you do it any differently from the way the CAB and NRC together are trying to do it?\\n\\nEveryone has a right to criticise and that’s democracy. People also criticise economic problems, terrorism etc. which may or may not be related to illegal immigration. But criticism alone will not solve problems, so I would really like to know if you guys were the Home Minister what would you do differently?\\n\\nI’m a layman with these questions so interested in finding answers.

Does it say that the Muslim family cannot apply for citizenship at all, or only that it can\\'t use the \"fast-track\" process?\\n\\n2) Furthermore, the Hindu family that was declared illegal can only be given the \"fast-track\" option if it can be proved that it was a persecuted minority in its home country, correct? If that cannot be proved, would they also lose the \"fast-track\" option?\\n\\n3) Finally, what happens if you are a persecuted Hindu/Muslim from another part of the world (let\\'s say, South Africa, for instance). Since you are not a persecuted minority from the three neighboring nations, does the CAB not apply to you at all?\\n\\nThanks everyone! The SC led by CJI has refused to stay the CAA.

It will be those without documentation from 30-40 years ago. That includes poor people, senior citizens, tribal, people living in remote rural areas. They will be termed illegal immigrants in thier nation. That is where CAA kicks in, they can say that they were persecuted and stay but the Muslims will be excluded and termed illegal even though they have been in India since generations. They will be thrown in detention camps (that\\'s horrible, check Assam detention videos).

I want to post my art on the protest but automod removed it. I deleted the post and tried again but it did again. What do I do? Correct me if I\\'m wrong, but it\\'s the nation wide implementation of the NRC that puts possibly millions of Muslims and other illegal immigrants who cannot produce the stipulated documents at the risk of losing their citizenships and being detained. This would happen with or without the amendment. The CAA basically contains the criteria for getting your name registered in the NRC i.e proving/gaining citizenship and the primary issues with the amendment is that it is unconsitutional for specific groups to be excluded from its benefits. -~~Only difference it should be making is that the cut off date for naturalization is different for separate groups~~ Is there any protest happening in Bangalore on the 25th?

I have a few questions regarding the proposed nationwide NRC.\\n\\n1. What would be the cutoff date for proving citizenship? For Assam it is the Bangladesh war which makes sense because most illegal immigrants came after that. But what about rest of India?\\n\\n2. If it is anyhow implemented then how will a non-muslim who don\\'t have documents to prove that he is indian citizen prove that he is a persecuted minority in Pakistan, bangladesh or Afghanistan? In that case how will the government prove that he is infact a non muslim. Let\\'s say a muslim converts to some another religion, gains citizenship under CAA, and then converts back to Islam.\\n\\n3. What according to you is the best way to identify illegal immigrants and deport them back? In the Bangladesh war of 1971, there was a state sponsored attack on hindus, so are they really illegal immigrants or refugees who fled targeted violence? And if the government agrees to relocate them in mainland India to ease pressure on N.E. states, Will you support the move? [deleted] How long will these protests last? I suppose the Assam experience hasn’t helped. And whatever any apologist may say, the CAA certainly IS a communal piece of legislation. Please note that NE is protesting for different reasons than the mainland. We are pro-NRC. Why is the UN not intervening into this on the lines of anti-secularism and anarchy?\\n\\nThis thing has also not made into the amjor headlines of international news in other countries... They keep talking about religion in CAB. But from what I understand, passports don\\'t mention religions. So realistically,anyone can just wear \"hindu\" attire, enter the nation as an Immigrant.

CAA applies only to minorities from THREE countries - Pakisthan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.  \\nMyth : Documents to prove citizenship needs to be collected now or people will be deported.  \\nFact   : WRONG.

Who deserves to be called inhumane then ? https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1206539826826076160.html Indian National Congress has came up as **biggest hypocrite** , they are protesting for **Violation of Assam Accord and deporting Bangladeshi illegal immigrants in North-East** and protesting why **Muslims are not included in Rest of India.**\\n\\n**Other Big Question is Kattapa Shah 👴 ne Assam ko kyu mara** I am CAA supporter. Protesters are not even sure what they are protesting against or for. [removed] [deleted] It\\'s really funny that everyone who is protesting does not understand the bill, and anyone who is not understands it fully!!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nlol! After reading the link above regarding  [**What Is The CAA-NPR-NRC Link? Explainer by LiveLaw.in**](https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/what-is-the-caa-npr-nrc-linkexplainer-151105) , there does not seem to be any link between CAA and NRC. Or am i reading it wrong? The article says it multiple times there is no link just based on current statements by many politicians, it is a fear that both will be linked?? https://youtu.be/yY8BonoYv2c\\n\\n\\nProtests in Bengal Why is so hard to understand\\nAll these amendments are not for existing citizens Has anyone gone through this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHVhTujFJ3E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHVhTujFJ3E&t=68s) If so any reason to believe such a certificate would not be possible to be obtained? (sorry for spamming every CAA related thread)\\n\\nHow can the CAA in its current avatar be used to disenfranchise Muslims large scale (after an NRC) and gulag them? The CAA seems to specify that only persecuted Hindus from those countries who already have the authorization to stay on as refugees can apply to be fast tracked. How will government make a Marathi Hindu dude who has fallen through the NRC cracks become a persecuted sindhi or Bengali from Pakistan/Bangladesh? What we should rather be protesting is the possibility of NRC becoming demonetization 2.0 Let\\'s be honest, no country today wants more Muslims. Uk, France, Belgium, Germany, US have openly said that. And I don\\'t see any issue with India following the same pattern. Is CAA harmful for Indian Muslims?\\n\\nNo it\\'s not! The CAA has no consequence whatsoever on pre-existing citizens, whether Indian or not.\\n\\nCan CAA revoke my citizenship?\\n\\nNo, CAA is cannot revoke anyone\\'s citizenship, it can only award citizenship to persecuted minorities of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh after they reside in the country for more than 6 years.\\n\\nDoes that mean only minorities of these three countries can avail citizenship of India?\\n\\nThe communities not included in the bill have to apply for Indian citizenship normally.\\n\\nWhy aren\\'t muslims included in this act?\\n\\nWhy would a Muslim face discrimination in an Islamic country based on his religion? Isn\\'t that the point of having an Islamic country? Muslims are excluded from this bill because the countries mentioned are countries where muslims are majority and hindus, other religions are monorities.\\n\\nThose countries have a record(from what I hav read) of treating minorties badly. India wants to bring them back and give them citizenship.\\n\\nMuslims if they want to live in india, who are from those mentioned countries can seek asylum in india and it\\'s completely a different process which can be done.\\n\\nOn NRC, there are people who already are registered as they want to spread it across india-people need to present a proof (which everybody even I think is difficult). They told that they\\'ll make it easy for people already residing india.\\n\\nPlease tell me, if there is anything else that needs to be looked upon. [deleted] Hey guys!

The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  and IIT Bombay. Powai Labs, a Mumbai-based company, has also invested in the venture and will own, market and support the product. \\n\\n> AJIT’s features can be compared to many of the microprocessors of its size available in today’s market. Unlike the ones used in the desktops like the Intel’s Xeon, AJIT is a medium-sized processor. It can be used inside a set-top box, as a control panel for automation systems, in a traffic light controller or even robotic systems. What’s more, the researchers expect that AJIT will cost as less as ₹100 when it is produced en-masse. \\n\\n> AJIT can run one instruction per clock cycle and can operate at clock speeds between 70-120MHz, comparable to its competitors in the market.\\n\\n> “We have been working on this processor design for more than two years now. The design has been tested on programmable semiconductor chips before we began our effort towards fabricating the processor,” says Prof. Desai\\n\\n> The researchers have made the software tools associated with AJIT freely available to everyone. The processor is also available as a ‘softcore’, where vendors can buy a license to use the design of the microprocessor and fabricate it to use it in their system. The researchers also offer to customise the processor for specific applications.\\n\\n\\nThere is a lot more info in the article. ELI5 how it is different from other processors and where IITB is planning to use it? Any RISC while using this? Can it run Crysis???? Whats next? How you are going forward with this ? a. How is this different from SHAKTHI?\\n\\nb. In What kind of hardware these chips might end up in? Laptops may be....?\\n\\nc. Any plans for mass producing? Have a few questions for you..\\n\\n1. Which module(s) were you part of?\\n\\n2. Which HDL was the processor coded in?\\n\\n3. What was the technology node this was done in? And what was the method of building standard cell library?\\n\\n4. Which language/methodology was used for verification?\\n\\n5. What was your preferred method for DFT?\\n\\n6. Can you disclose the layout, package analysis and SI tools?\\n\\n7. Which aspect of the processor, according to you, was most challenging?\\n\\n8. Is this our own fab? I\\'m dying to know we can have cutting edge fab tech in India. Been watching out for this for about 2 decades now.\\n\\nThanks for this ama, and keep doing the good work! Congratulations! Are there going to be further iterations, or is this the final product? And are you going to dive into mass production straightaway? what are the commercial applications or is it just a milestep to develop something even more complex Can it run Chrome with five open tabs? I\\'m a non IT guy (Accounts). Can someone explain the significance of this? Wasn\\'t the 1st microprocessor developed by IIT Madras? Shakti.  How is it different from it & can it compete with Intel? Can we build a low cost Raspberry Pi/Arduino alternative with this chip? Or what kind of hardware specs are yet to be integrated in this for one to realise a functioning SBC for the DIY maker community. Thanks for doing this AMA! I\\'m really interested in the field of architecture.\\nDoes this processor implement pipelining? Does it dispatch instructions in order or does it implement out of order dispatch/processing? Why not RISC? What is the design team size at IITB? I assume the final synthesis, verification, and layout was done in Cadence? How many design cycles did you need before taping out the final version? Sorry for too many questions! Once the final version is out into mass production, can we have a course like *NAND to Tetris*, where they try to teach us how an entire computer is built out of nand gate. \\n\\nSomething like this for electronics(in this case the design) which will ease the fear and improve the understanding, of course this should come out in free time How much did it cost to develop this processor? Is this the same as developed in IIT Madras?? Which was fabricated for free at Oregon? Wow. This is amazing!!\\n\\nI\\'m guessing this is based on open source hardware. Is the architecture of this cpu available to take a look at? Congratulations! Can you give a bit of a overview of what it is capable of? What kind of skills would i need to become a part of something like this? I\\'m currently doing my undergrad in ECE. Which subjects should i focus more on to develop the skills you have to make a chip like this? Hey,\\n\\nWhile I really commend the AJIT work from IIT Bombay, I feel there are quite a few mis-conceptions in the AMA which need to be addressed. This is in no way critical of AJIT, just that people should be more aware of the information they consume.\\n\\n>IIT Madras partnered with Bluespec to work in collaboration with them for a major part. Here we have implemented everything from scratch.\\n\\nUntrue. IIT Madras used the Bluespec language. It\\'s like saying if I used Rust, I worked in collaboration with Mozilla. Now the counter-point given here by OP of AMA is that it is an American company and Ajit is developed in India, so all good. Now let me tell you, developing a language and compiler is hard. That is why Bluespec started at MIT, has one of the few companies that has got it right and with around 10 years of experience in this field, their product is really good for processor dev. Also, Bluespec has DARPA funded programs, which increases the confidence in their language.\\n\\nBluespec is happy to give free licenses to educational institutions! Do check them out. Finally, the code we write in Bluespec is owned by the writers, no **partnering with Bluespec**.\\n\\n>Yes, it is a pipelined processor and thus in-order.\\n\\nMate, don\\'t expect to make statements like these if you designed a processor by yourself. Your statement implies, a pipelined processor is always in-order. So are Intel/Amd chips not pipelined, as they are out-of-order. I\\'ll give you the benefit of doubt that you mis-typed that, hope you get across.\\n\\n>RISC-V is not considered a stable architecture by many people around the world and is not a proven architecture whereas Sparc is an old but proven architecture and hence was a better choice.\\n\\nI don\\'t know where you get this from mate. Did you know the Pixel 3 from Google has a RISC-V core in it? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7aAUlHoV2E&t=55s)\\n\\nOr that NVIDIA is going to use RISC-V in their GPU\\'s? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg1lISJfJI0&t=645s)\\n\\nOr that Western Digital has already committed to replacing all their chips with RISC-V cores, and they have open source cores out there? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlIhU_vovP0)\\n\\nThe only notable company I knew anything about developing Sparc processors was Fujitsu, for supercomputers. Even they moved to ARM -\\n\\n>We first caught wind of the Post-K supercomputer back in June 2016, when Fujitsu unveiled some of the architectural features of the future machine and confirmed its switch from Sparc64-fx motors to a custom Arm chip.\\n\\n[Link](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/08/24/fujitsus-a64fx-arm-chip-waves-the-hpc-banner-high/)\\n\\n>Shakti was built using proprietary software and this has been built from scratch so technically this is the first one. Yes, it is an SoC. I can\\'t reveal that information here because of NDAs. The compiler already exists for Sparc-v8 and has been provided by GNU org.\\n\\nSo then don\\'t call it India\\'s first indigenous processor. Call it India\\'s first indigenous processor-design language and not India\\'s **first indigenous processor.** Because Shakti with the open-source code-base - [Link](https://bitbucket.org/casl/c-class), an ACM publication - [Paper](https://acc.digital/shakti-an-open-source-processor-ecosystem/) can safely claim to have been designed before you.\\n\\nAnyways, it doesn\\'t matter if Shakti was even the 10th fucking processor in line after miles, it would just be better if [u/prabot](https://www.reddit.com/u/prabot) stopped making misinformed comments. If you call yourself an academician working at a prestigious place like IITB, you should put a bit more thought into your responses. Are you planning to do MBA from IIMA as well. What\\'s the cost compared to an Intel/AMD processor? And clock speed? What was the most challenging part? Are you from electronics or CSE? As a cse student from another iit this sounds a great development and shows the amount of hard work you guys put in research. Congratulations!  \\n \\nPS : hire me in next placement season What is the purpose of creating this processor? Do you see India as a competent nation Atleast in terms of necessary resources for setting international industrial standards for this chip in near future(10-15 years)?\\n\\nSumming up,can we use these chips like the pic/Arm/Avr in anytime in future or is it too early to call a shot? Congrats! Any plans for a retail development board? What is the full form of AJIT? Will you employ americans to do your telephone support? What were your biggest challenges ? When was this accomplished? [Link to the detailed article](https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-%E2%80%98made-india%E2%80%99-microprocessor)\\n\\nP.S : Thanks to u/kash_if Congrats!\\n\\nAre you going to release it publically? Like for use in phones and computers? Or is it going to be reserved for research purposes?\\n\\nAlso how is it better than currently used processors? i seem to be more interested in how did you get involved. i have similar ambitions. could you, please? How good is fabrication from SCL? Are you going to open source the instruction set, bootloader code, etc? Where can I download the RTL, is it there on opencores? Business Perspective: Will India be into processor fabrication, like how it is into IT services. Do we have required raw materials and the process to fabricate with cost lesser than importing one. I have a more general question. China is investing a lot in semiconductors in order to reduce chip imports. It also has companies like HiSilicon which is aiming for competing with the likes of Qualcomm. India is obviously not quite there yet but there have been voices calling for this for years.\\n\\nHow realistic should we be with our expectations? When could we see an Indian competitors to these kinds of companies? Do you think the state needs to step in the way it has in China with massive financial support or do you think the private sector can do it on its own with some collaboration with academia? Thanks. - Is the tech used on par with what other international makers are using? Where do we fall behind? \\n\\n- Why would a device maker use this processor instead of commercially available similar processors?\\n\\n- How far is it from mass production? Will it even be mass produced or just remain a lab experiment?\\n\\n- Why do you think are we so far behind in this space? Almost all developed countries have dozens of fab plants and India has just one? Why is govt. not investing in this industry, this industry alone could give a massive boost to the Indian economy? What instruction set? [deleted] 1)Does it require its own motherboard or is it compatible with commercial available mobo.                    \\n   2) How will you compare it with current gen CPU of Intel and AMD,like which processor will it be comparable to.             \\n               3)How much RAM it supoort How far is it from mass production? When could we see any company or you announcing real world products? I don\\'t really have a question - just wanted to congratulate you and the entire team - hope this endeavor continues to even greater heights. Well done! [deleted] That is so fucking cool. Kitna deti hai? I don’t know much about processors or about tech in India but it looks cool and you have my upvote We were told you were making this, in VJTI. One time Prof. Girish Kumar mentioned this too. Congratulations on its completion. 💜 Now we’ll have to call America for support Respect bro A wonderful achievement itself , I hope that we can see India producing microprocessors with the likes of Intel or AMD\\'s flagship microprocessors at a cheap rate and paving the new generation of microprocessors for the betterment of technology and the country soon enough. Congrats, you\\'ve made us proud! Btech or Mtech Honest question: why have you started this AMA on a Sunday past midnight? fabrication ? \\n10 nm ? x86, ARM or something new? Can it run Crysis? [deleted] Which Architecture dose it support and what is max data carrying and crunching capacity of this processor ? Where and by whom did you get the fabrication done?\\n\\nDo you think we can get mobile phone manufacturers to set up high volume fabrication (not assembly, which are already in few places or will be) plants in India? \\nCongratulations quite happy to see development of a processor in India \\nCan you list the issues facing the semi conductor development and  fabrication sector in our country? like we do not have a single fab company That manufacturers of devices could use What is the distance between its transistors? How did you get into the process of creating it? How does it differ from other processors in terms of performance and efficiency? I am assuming there must be some caveats as this is a new project so can you please mention them. Specs details? Are you looking to make it an industry standard, if yes, what advantage does it have over intel or similar popular processors First of all many many congratulations..!! \\nSo what are the future plans? Only use it for the systems and applications you mentioned above? Or near future you have any commercialization plans for this processor to be used in PC\\'s? How can i be involed in any manner in any kind of process within this project? . Damn keen on knowing/understanding this development. [deleted] Wasn\\'t Shakti the first one?\\nHow similar are the two?\\nMajor applications? Could you please share what processor node this was based on? Is it market ready or still a kind of prototype? If it is market ready, what are the next plans for use of this mp? But the real question is, can you game with it? RISC based ? How is it compared to the currently available same type of processors? Thanks for the ama!\\nSome questions I have-\\n\\n1. What tools did you use for apr? And does Iit bombay have good license support?\\n\\n2. You mentioned you’re moving to 65, which fab would this be made by?\\n\\n3. Does Scl supply any memory compilers?\\n\\n4. How much of the chip was made in custom?\\n\\n5. Why did you use vhdl instead of system verilog? Why have you named it Ajit man ? We already got a \"Ajit Pai\" meme, the dude who tried to destroy internet, now soon we will have Ajit processor meme\\'s, why on Earth would you name a processor Ajit ? Why not something like Arjun, Drona, Bhishma, Ram, Shiv, Karna, Karma, Duryodhan, Ravan, Hanuman, Bajrang, Vayu, Trimorti, Bheem or anything else ? So this is different from the “Shakti” processor from IIT Madras? This looks really cool. What desktop processor does it compare to in terms of performance ? I have answered a lot of questions in a short while. I think I will come back after a bit. Please keep the questions coming I am really excited about upcoming questions. Where do plan to get it fabricated at 65nm? Is SCL starting fabrication at 65nm? Is Mass production of this going to happen in India or abroad? I read you said it\\'ll be mass produced at an aim of 100rs but will that be possible to be done within in India? Does India have a leap-frog advantage of starting late in this field? Like the lack of credit cards was okay since we leap frogged to finance apps for credit Don\\'t know much about processors but that looks gorgeous This is exicitng. \\nNano meter? Also do you think we\\'ll be able to mass produce? If AJIT was comparable in performance and speed to a commercially available processor that was made in the past, which one would you equate it to? Any reason behind the name AJIT ?  \\nAlso, congrats and good luck What incentive do businesses have to design their products using this processor? Does it require external cooling? Or is the IHS enough to cool this processor? What kind of power consumption can it handle? Also does What kind of TDP applies to it. You\\'ve made so proud and happy OP we need more of you. How complicated is the manufacturing for this processor? Process node? Are there any public papers on how their transistor performance compares to competitors ? What are some pros and cons from x86 and Arm Congratulations :D How commercially viable is this processor. When ARM, Intel and AMD are flooded the market. Do you have any plans to sell Dev kits like raspberry pi? What exactly has been built from ground up? Is it the ISA? Is is the underlying VLSI? Is the actual fab done in India? Can it make me a sandwich? What next? It\\'s 2019 ffs. Congratulations OP. You guys have accomplished a enormous task. I am proud of you people. Some questions if you don\\'t mind.\\n\\n1-Are guys planning to release an SoC of this.?\\n2-Is there 64 bit or further in the future?\\n3-How many no of transistors does it have?\\n4-Is it able to run the Linux Kernel?\\n5-What was the most challenging part in the design of the AJIT? Why didn’t we make it any time sooner? What were the challenges that stopped us from making this processor in earlier decades?\\nThere are some really famous and efficient processors readily available in the market at affordable price. Are you planning to get this project to that level or is it only for research purposes. Compare it with something like ARM7 / ARM M4 ? I’ve installed a chip like that by hand. Hand formed, hand soldered. This is a remarkable feat but this causes a brief flashback. Aside from the awesome technical accomplishment,  I must also acknowledge the pleasing aesthetic of your product.\\n\\nCongratulations! Hey great work indeed. How big are the dimensions of current processor? I’ll buy a development board if there ever is one available! Does it have a built in serial UART? Where did you copy-pasted the design? You just made my point Could you tell us the specifications? Transistor size, density, etc. What level of clean room is available to you? 100? Techniques used for lithography and masks.\\n\\nI\\'m also intrigued by the code to hardware thing. I\\'d guess specialized hardware runs orders of magnitude faster as opposed to generalized ones. \\n\\nWould it be possible to make a chip for a particular time consuming program(say photo shop or matlab) making it much cheaper hardware wise if you wish to use it for a singular purpose. Making it sort of cartridges like which used to be case with nes video games making it impossible to pirate a software.\\n\\nAlso most of the specialized machines (SEM, TEM) we have run on way old computer software e.g. 95 and 98 as they don\\'t invest in drivers for newer version of windows. Would it be possible to replace the controller of these machines with a single use computer.\\n\\nAlso is anyone working on quantum computing? People are trying to build it up from scratch so wouldn\\'t it be better if we could jump on it. More like mobile revolution happened in India skipping the landline revolution. OP can you suggest me some resources on 8086. IWTL I have a genuine doubt about something being called \\'indigenous\\'. What does it really mean? hope this captures diy market and helps developing prototype projects quickly Congratulations on your success. Even though i dont know anything about computers. But this looks interesting. Well done! Could this guy run Linux? What sort of I/O does it provide? (Ethernet, GPIO, I2C, etc) where is it manufactured?? Btw great job.  What’s with the name? Any chances for a cooler name that appeals to the millennials? Why the naming? It sucks so bad.. get a ambitious name atleast. First of all congratulations! Its great achievement.\\n\\nDoes it have its own Instruction set? Is it RISC or CISC? How come only a few newspapers and reddit will celebrate these achievements which come out of IITs and IISc ? This is awesome. Congrats. But, since you mentioned the “future,” I am wondering if you and your team are ready to bypass all patents for chip manufacturing. Eg. developed patentable creative way of developing it without interfering prior arts. \\n\\nI wonder why military can’t use foreign chipsets; maybe reverse engineering to make sure it does what it does would be sufficient enough and cost effective. How many masks were needed to fabricate this? How long will it take to launch it to market\\nAnd what more improvements are we looking at? can you please state the specs Is there a reference manual and a compiler?\\n\\nWhat are the advantages of developing own microprocessor compared to picking up an ARM reference architecture and customizing it for your own requirements? How much cooling does it require? Is it passively cooled? Asking since the clock speed isn\\'t something in Ghz.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhat kind of motherboard or accessories does it require to work? What about things such as RAM and other hardware controllers like storage or other things? (sorry if question isn\\'t clear I\\'m not much of a Chip guy lol.) any chance of a micro controller/processor like arduino/rspbpi? with peripherals? Congrats! How long did the whole project take to reach up to this prototype? What\\'s the power consumption of this prototype?\\n\\nHow do you come up with the Rs 100 estimate of mass produced cost?\\n\\nWhat\\'s the minimum feature size/technology node of the fab process for Ajit?\\n\\nDo the power consumption and performance meet the envisioned use case for satellite deployment? Hiya OP, I\\'m glad you guys have done this, it\\'s quite something, do you plan on building anything in the future for desktop grade architecture? Cheers! what is the ISA for this processor? are there any benchmarks? what architecture was used to produce this RISC or CISC..?? Yay Considering the many processors that are currently in the market, could you please tell us how this compares or rather how this is better? Could you also lay the difference in cost when comparing with other processors in the same category?\\n\\nNow that this was fabricated in India where do you see the future of of microprocessor fabrication in our country?\\n\\nEDIT: how would this compare to an ARM, raspberrypi and so on? Can we expect this to be commercially available for home projects? Can it run minesweeper What will be the benchmark processor if we wish to compare with other popular ones. ? Will this be commercialized, and actually be able to compete with processors by other big companies? Cost less than rs100 if produced on a mass scale? How much does a processor of same specs cost in the market? What is the assumed profit margin to your product? Does it work? What educational background do I need to join your team? Reading through all the comments and sub-comments, I can\\'t help but wonder that this AMA is a supreme example of how an AMA should be. [deleted] Hi there,\\n\\nI have a couple of questions (3 infact)\\n\\n1. Why do we not have our own indigenous processors that compete with the likes of Giants like Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Exynos or Kirin? I mean its been so long, we have some greatest brains in our country.\\n2. Not offending anyone, but we could have probably reverse engineered the process or taken help from engineers who have previously worked for these companies. Why do we have to start from scratch? Why start from Mhz? Why not directly Ghz? (atleast 1 Ghz would be good. Enthusiasts would probably buy this instead of the Raspberry Pi and provide some funding to the research)\\n3. At this rate, how long do you think will it take to reach a competitive level in terms of the \"nm\" tech.? (Please don\\'t say near future) Which programmable chip (I am assuming some FPGA) did you use for testing AJIT? I will try a HPC around it. Xilinx devkits are really good at combining softcores and provide an on-board ARM processor to build a complete embedded system where you can accelerate hardware and use ARM\\'s existing computational capabilities. 1. How long did it take to complete the entire ASIC flow? \\n2. Is there a spec sheet available? Im all in for indigenous technology..But don\\'t you think we are bit too late in the processor making race. Even mobile processors have achieved GHz capacity with half a dozen parallel cores with integrated peripherals. Even if we catch up with the big players in the market, we will still need to build the ecosystem around it, do you think we can do that ? \\n\\nI agree this is just a start, we can use low frequency processors in a lot of military, industrial and household equipments - microwaves, washing machines, are you guys looking at a niche within that or is it going to be some heavy computing in future?\\n\\nAnd, i kinda feel that government wants to make headlines with this, every government in india does that, how is their support in the long term ? \\n\\nAlso, this is a very huge opportunity, it feels great to be a part of something this big. How is the diversity in the public institutions that support this kind of leg room in technological research ? Kudos Brother / Sister. :) Hearty congratulations on your Achievements\\n\\nBrutal Question\\nDo you plan to implement a secret CPU running inside the processor which has complete remote access, similar to Intel\\'s **Management Engine** or AMD\\'s **TrustZone**?\\n\\nIf not how would you takle pressure from government authorities in case it is mandated. Benchmarks pls Reading AJIT on that chip triggers me because of AJIT PAI. \\n\\nNonetheless, Kudos for this achievement OP and his team. Can it run crysis? Hi, I am so interested in designing microchips and processors. Being part of a team that develops such products is so awesome! I am currently on my way to enter Mtech VLSI in one of the NITs. Can you suggest some essential tools/skills that\\'ll help me to get into such industry? I am from electronics background and circuits have always fascinated me. Wrong, IIT Madras developed \\'SHAKTI\\' processor in Nov 2018 Looks like arc reactor from Ironman 2 (it\\'s square instead of triangle). One question though, how is it different from other processors in the market (despite it would be produced in India) and are we planning to mass produce it here? And congratulations, this marks a success!! I initially thought, it was a carom board. When will it be mass produced? So you started from wafer level? How did you get all the etching done? That\\'s a very nice and insanely costly thing to have to just make one chip, isn\\'t it? Any plans to build GPUs? u/prabot kudos on the success. I had a query. What is the socket/pin description for AJIT? Wasn\\'t Shakti the first one???\\nPlease correct me if I\\'m wrong. How many nanometers? Can it compete with STM 32? What architecture is it? Is it a new one? Comparable with STM 32? Architecture? Btw wasn\\'t riscv based shakti released before your processor? All I see is that you\\'re going for the embedded market, but every story I read describes the AJIT as a microprocessor. Are you planning on making a microcontroller with this architecture or is it meant to be a processor only?\\n\\nI mean a 32bit 100MHz uC for approx 2usd would be sweet, although I don\\'t, from a marketability standpoint, understand why you went with the sparc v8. I guess licensing ARM would render the chip too expensive.\\n\\nI\\'m going to stick with AVR and ARM for now, but I wish you good luck with the AJIT. Does it do the needful? PAPA ne nahin bola sharma ji ka beta is in Intel making 10nm processors /s Show bobs and vagna RISC V ARCH I Guess ? what does it run?, what architecture is this? , what\\'s the benchmark? \\nany link to such details would be appreciated.\\n\\nNice work though. Will there be any requirement of operating system / kernel developer ? \\nWhat will be Applications ? I\\'m really intersted in learning this stuff (designing processors / how processors work) do you have any book recommendations? But can it run Crisis? Do you hope to rival other processor manufacturers such as intel and AMD in their processing power? Or aiming to excel above their standards? Would you say that the price would be similar or cheaper? And final question, would you also manufacture a cooling system that best suits this new processor that is both light weight and highly efficient? If so you got my complete support! Is nanotechnology a buzzword or will it make an impact? Thank you for sharing this!  Just curious why choose C and not C++ Oh wow to my gaming mind that looked similar to  pc processor lol, but im still amazed and hopefully this will be the technological boost needed to push india into the forefront of technological development can it be used as raspberry pi for learning. if yes will it be commercially available at a cheaper price than pi? Can I play Skyrim with it? I Salute you anyway. Where do you see India in the next 10 years in this particular field ? Are there any mega plans or vision policy that the government has regarding this? How are we doing on the theoretical front of it ,as in what is the original research output that we are generating ? How does it compare to Intel and AMD cpus? What\\'s your JEE score /s Following the Moore\\'s always we will be reaching the current configurations of CPU\\'s around 20 years from now OP ? Or shorter. But still this is amazing, I have seen the productions lines, and it seems hella crazy, so much precision, care and methods. Great Work !! Can it run Crysis? How is this different (or better) than other silicon based processors from silicon valley? I\\'m curious @prabot do you work at powai labs ? Will it still follow Moore\\'s law ? :) Congratulations from IIT Kharagpur. Even though this is much slower than Industry standard processors around the world.  \\nI\\'m still proud of this achievement done in India. Hopefully our government will start funding more towards this. I\\'m not a technical guy, but, is there a possibility that the project can, sometime in future, be scaled up into a motherboard that can go into laptops made in India for Indian market? I\\'m sick of people always bragging about how electronics are cheaper overseas and the lengths to which people go to save $100 on their laptops by asking their overseas cousins to get mobiles and laptops for them. I\\'d really like to see laptops and other electronics developed in India and being cost-competitive with the rest of the world. All of the following question are on ELI5 level :\\n\\n1.) Can you do a comparison of your processor and i3/i5 .\\n\\n2.) Can processors be reverse engineered? how hard is to reverse engineer a processor.\\n\\n3.) Who are the giants in the field of processors research/R&D.\\n\\n4.) What are the key obstacles in the development of processors.\\n\\n5.) What kind of equipments are needed to manufacture your product? are these machineries available/produced in india? what machineries are required to mass produce your product. Also, what\\'s the cost of manufacturing your product (say 10,000 processor)\\n\\n6.) why it took so many years for india to produce a processor while companies like intel is selling it to millions?\\n\\n7.) I see in every few month a more developed processor is launched (i3 ----> i5 ----> i7)  why is that they couldn\\'t able to produce the current version few months ago? how come they weren\\'t able to produce it then but just after 6 months they can produce it now.\\n\\n8.) What\\'s the highest potential of current processor technology? \\n\\n9.) I have heard about quantum processors, are they the next generation of processors? how different is the quantum processor technology to the current processor technology?\\n\\n10.) If you had a superconductor, what effect would you have on your processor/ or in the world of processor? What programming language did you the most? ARM? He\\'s answered only 2 questions by my count and they were pretty softball ones. Pack it up boys. This is starting to look like the Arnoob Goswami AMA. Propaganda at its finest. I wonder if this processor even exists or if it\\'s just another fabrication of the government propaganda? Heard that it is based on havard architecture instead of von Neumann. Why is that? [removed] I thought SHAKTI was India’s first microprocessor. Does it run `gcc`? Could you tell me why some of the brats from IIT are so arrogant? Bet it works as well as testicles in a pc Wow! Salute to the guy who made India proud! Does it have a toilet ? Kitna deti hai?? Why does India make it so hard to do business with other countries? Non tech guy here. Is this chip a mobile processor? I hope and believe if Indians would finally stop leaking their top talent to other countries and find a way to implore them to staying there. I feel extremely bad how all the incredible talent that our nation generates leaves and ends up fighting to find a way to find citizenship in an another country as opposed to leading our own to greatness. \\n\\nI am one of them and I feel ashamed of that fact every day.\\n\\nHopefully one day I can return and pride myself for being Indian.. \\n\\n#JAIHIND Can it run Crysis?

I really liked how the paper was very secular , gave you information about somr major religions which most people I know don't know about Where are you now?

Capital of India is New Delhi technically. Also please give your location - it should be North India. North of India makes it look at if Kashmir is a separate entity from India. Being an Atheist it sucks to see how religion is fed into a kid's brain before they learn science and stuff... This prevents them from questioning their religion.\", ' How does one join your team full-time and part-time? What type of roles do you have? Do you like to eat mangoes? What\\'s your business model?

I want to Thank you for the brilliant work you are doing. Such work requires a lot of personal sacrifices and I\\'m sure there are lacs who appreciate it.\\n\\nI have only one question:\\n\\nWhat do you see as AltNews biggest threat today? How can the average Indian help you combat this? Can you guys develop something like a browser extension which can automatically alert about a fake news page when visited. For example, anti virus software indicate weather a web page has malicious links etc. [removed] Do you ever get threat calls by Political parties for exposing fake news? You are doing all your work from Ahmedabad. How do you do verification of information in other cities when someone has to go physically to a place. I\\'m sure many of us would be ready to volunteer our services in these cases. Do you keep records of who shares the most amount of fake news on Twitter? Would love to see a chart listing the top 25 fake news tweeters in India and share it on Whatsapp in all my groups. I have a feeling that M Kishwar will top the charts if one is prepared Pratik, do you believe in religion/concept of an omnipotent higher power? Hi Pratik,\\nBeen a follower since Alt news inception. Great work, big fan..!\\nI just wonder why ALT NEWS is not getting much popularity that it deserves. Hire a PR agency may be?\\nThanks Have you ever made a mistake? Like not checking a fact or news properly and mislabeling it as false? How did you correct it? Do you think social media platforms should remove content which fact checkers have deemed false? \\n\\nIf yes, doesn\\'t that put a lot of power in the hands of the factcheckers, who can then easily suppress opinions contrary to theirs? In essence, the question is who checks the factcheckers. \\n\\nIf no, what can we do to reduce fake news on social media, without taking away people\\'s right to free speech? Yesterday I had a big argument on Twitter(less surprising, eh?) that Altnews shows a bias on one side only, but I countered by saying most of the fake news is generated to favour one side of the table. \\n\\nHow would Pratik convince people on that side that AltNews is absolutely neutral and brutal when it comes to quashing misinformation/disinformation? I want to contribute to altnews, but live outside India. The funding page  via instamojo only accepts payment methods from India. How else can I donate? How do you guys first determine that one piece of information might be fake?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen determined how do you guys investigate the information further?\\n\\n\\nIs there one particular thing which is false but its belived to be true by majority which have amused you guys? Can you tell us if during this current government the number of fake news against Muslims has increased in the recent years or not? And if yes How could we tackle it here.\\n\\nMy next question is, Is there a troll army who sends Islamophobic whastapp and twitter messages daily on behalf of BJP to make their front strong?\\n\\nEdit:And you people are doing a good job for Humanity. Profit or not. The service you are doing with credibility you people have made in recent years is worth praise. Aapka aur Zubair bhai ka Bahot bahot dil se shukriya Dhanyawad. Hi Pratik,   \\n\\n\\n* Do you think checking whether a news article is fake can be automated in the near future (so that there can be a mobile app that more-or-less does the job)?\\n* Do you think the prevalence of fake news articles that we are seeing (which is being used by interested parties to shape their narrative) is the new normal in the political scenario from now on? If yes, is there a sustainable way to fight it? Are you hopeful that our current liberal constitution will ultimately prevail over the fascist theocratic ideologies contesting it? In the age of post truth, busting fake informations are still worth it for the people?\\nI haven\\'t see yet , any politicians or any celebrities apologize or regret for spreading fake news.\\nHow do you defend yourself from allegations that you are more anti bjp? Hi Pratik, I am just curious have you teamed with social media platforms to provide this as a service , also have they incorporated your tool within their platform? Don’t get me wrong AltNews is absolutely wonderful. Yet, it does not deter Whatsapp aunty uncle post shit, and also you cannot counter every other version of fake news out there in various languages.\\n\\nWhat do you think is the way forward? Hi. Pratik. Great fan of Altnews. Been following you since the beginning. Currently I have a job as an engineer. A decent one. I don\\'t have a degree in journalism but I feel more interested in the kind of work you do. I would really love to work with you. I\\'m ready to quit my current job. And I don\\'t expect a high salary.  What do you recommend? 1) Which Indian news organizations would you like to commend for their attention to detail when it comes fact-checking / reporting the truth? \\n\\n2) If one were to make donations, which independent journalism organizations would you reccommend (in addition to AltNews of course)? How do we train the average person to have enough information literacy to be able to evaluate claims so that services like yours are not needed? When was your most busy month/week of last 5 years? Social Media in a wonderful technology in connecting people. But they have failed miserably to tackle fake news, hate, threat messages, etc. Do you feel the same that social media have poorly managed these issues and they still have a miserable outlook for it?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThank for your work. You are my hero, virtual hugs!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Thank \\\\*for\\\\* your work. Any plans on creating a fact-check on speeches made by politicians? Like an Indian Politifact? Also, would it ever be feasible to create an approval rating system, like the US, in India?\\n\\nP.S. A massive THANK YOU. You have no idea how much AltNews helps me, esp on WhatsApp University. Please keep doing the great work that you do! How did you transitioned from a soft dev to mass media. \\nDid you did any courses regarding this . There are some fake news which seem to not be beneficial for any political party and are just plain useless, so who\\'s gaining from them ? Alt news is doing a great job. But unfortunately the major source of misinformation and propoganda is by mainstream media itself. Them with the powerful IT cell and ground level workers set the agenda. And the opposition always are reacting.\\n\\n Through CAA protest we have set the narrative for the first time. But BJP can easily make it a hindu Muslim issue and polarise. \\n\\nSo my question is how would we set the agenda when we have a weak opposition, pliable media, powerful fake news factory? Do you think the volume of disinformation is going to increase in the coming years?  Also, why does the right seem to be more indulged in fake news than the left? @frthnker - How can one contribute to the betterment of society apart from donating to an organization like yours? I\\'m sure there are many people like me who have some spare time on their hands but not sure how to best utilize it. I\\'m done with trying to convince extremists in my friend circle, it\\'s futile. How much of this is fake and how much is true?\\n\\n\\nThese are names of 28 Nationalist Business men who looted money of Indian Tax Payers\\n\\n1) Vijay Mallaya \\n2) Mehul Choksi \\n3) Nirav Modi\\n4) Nishan Modi \\n5) Pushpesh Baidya \\n6) Asish\\n7) Sunny Kalara \\n8) Arti Kalara\\n9) Sunjay Kalara \\n10) Varsha Kalara \\n11) Sudhir Kalara \\n12) Jatin Mehta \\n13) Umesh Parikh\\n14) Kamlesh Parikh\\n15) Nilesh Parikh\\n16) Vinay Mittal \\n17) Eklavya Garg \\n18) Chetan Jayantilal \\n19) Nitin Jayantilal \\n20) Dipti Bein Chetan\\n21) Saviya Saith \\n22) Rajiv Goyal\\n23) Alaka Goyal \\n24) Lalit Modi \\n25) Ritesh Jain \\n26) Hitesh Nagenderbai Patel \\n27) Mayuribein Patel \\n28) Ashish Suresh Bhai \\n       \\nTotal looted amount \\n 10,00,000 crore (only Ten Lakh Crore Rupees )\\n\\nSpecialty: \\nNone of them : \\n** was Pakistani\\n** was Muslim \\n** was declared Terrorist \\n** was Naxalist \\n** was SC ST\\n\\nThey all : \\nBelongs to Gujarat\\n\\nI know first isn’t coz mallya is from mangalore.\\n\\nAlso, it would be nice if your platform could provide a verification service and your team can verify the submissions with high frequencies. Would help reduce fake news by a lot, no? 1. What has the experience with AltNews taught you about your own biases and human biases in general? \\n2. How do you rein in your biases while building an \\'unbiased\\' fact-checking organization?\\n3. How do you decide what to fact-check? Example: How \\'trendy\\' should the story be? What ideology does that story represent? Hi sir, I have been receiving fake news in telugu language, can I send them to u Hi Pratik. Thanks for the great work with AltNews. I am following you on social media since ToG days. What do you think can be done to counter misinformation and propaganda about Indian history? IMO, portrayal of Hindu-Muslim issues as an ongoing civilization war is something that has caused a lot of damage. Any books you\\'d recommend looking at the current situation of the country? I have been following you on Twitter for quite a while now. Very impressed with your work. Kudos to you for your hard work. In the world of propaganda and fake news we need entities like Alt News. How are you managing the finances for Alt News? Are donations enough to pay you and the staff a decent wage and to ensure a decent output? **Request :**  Can you add a new section in your website for \\'official/provable data and statistics\\', this would be a game changer for the people who are trying to convince other people and their family to fight against fascism.\\n\\nAlso, Indian govt. is very quickly destroying internet freedom and internet it-self, do you have any plans for that? What would you do if some upcoming laws can be twisted to frame web outlets like \\'Alt-news\\' as \"Cyber Criminals\" ?\\n\\nYou are the light we india need :) I was curious, how is Press Freedom in India right now? Has it worsened or stayed the same as before? [deleted] Great effort with Altnews. We badly need this.\\n\\nUnfortunately the usability of detecting \\'fake news\\' with altnews is quite hard. Maybe Altnews can display news (say headlines) and then highlight the fake ones. That way, I can come to altnews and get reliable news - else I have to visit other sites for news and then come to altnews to see what was fake about a past headline (a day old.. or a few days old).\\n\\nOr maybe it can be a browser extension that automatically strikes out fake news headlines on say Times/Hindu/hindustantimes etc. With government becoming autocratic day by day, have you considered the possibility of the state coming after altnews or hinder the donations? \\n\\nDoes the newspapers/sites pay altnews if an article is based on your investigation as license fee or so? Are you guys planning to go on TV anytime soon? Because we surely need a news channel to debunk all these news and unbiased journalism First and foremost, you guys deserve a great round of applause for the amount of fake news you bust everyday. \\n\\nI just have one question\\nWhat business model do you follow?\\nWhat are ways in which you generate revenue? 1. What methods do you employ for fact checking an article.\\n\\n2. Are there any non-monetary ways in which we can assist to curb fake news. Hi Pratik, thanks for doing this!\\n\\n- Firstly, I must say one of the coolest things I\\'ve witnessed during the whole CAA/NRC protests is the role that AltNews has played. There has been a vile push to spread fake videos and propaganda, sadly communal and hence dangerous more often than not, and at every stage ALtNews has been the credible voice to counter that. Seeing several people reply to hate-filled fake video tweets with the link to your site has been a blessing that not other nations get to see in their national debates. Thank. You.\\n\\n\\n- **My question**: How do you think we can get platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to start using services like AltNews as part of their platform so that fake information can be removed and not just called out in comments? (I know FB ran a pilot in the US a year ago but nothing came of it)\\n\\nBecause currently it goes something like this\\n\\n- Person 1 posts fake video\\n- Person 2 attaches the AltNews link and says it\\'s fake/old video\\n- Person 1 either ignores or says so what it still happened in some point in time\\n- Person 1\\'s followers still keep on seeing the video and believe what they want to believe\\n\\nWe need more than just people calling others out. If the fake content stays up, it still has significant influence. How do you track fake news? A huge volume of these are passed around in encrypted group messages. \\n\\nPerhaps keeping track of misinformation twitter bots could be one way to capture what is also being sent out in private groups. Tools such as the following could help? \\nhttps://hoaxy.iuni.iu.edu/ \\nhttps://osome.iuni.iu.edu/tools/botslayer/ Hi Pratik, how does fact checking work? Does it work from the reverse order where you see the original news source, and then compare it with an suspicious one, or do you scrounge the Internet for an answer? If so, how? Hi Pratik, \\n\\nMe and my friends have actually been wanting to create a website for publishing stories on certain events, inspired by Hasan Minhaj\\'s show *Patriot Act.* What are certain reliable sources you would recommend, and do you recommend us to start with Indian issues (because of the way dissidents are hunted) or world issues? Personally, i disagree with the claim that India is a democracy. What India has is a functional voting system with and ignorant electorate and even worse \"leaders\".\\n\\nWhen are we going to stop pretending, when are we going to wake up and realize that all we have is an illusion of democracy. Sure we can vote, but its the same two parties everywhere, and we all know whoever we put in power is going to steal from us, and we can\\'t do shit about it. The same old shit of religion and caste has been going on for decades now, nothing has changed, we may be sick and tired of it, but we sure as hell can\\'t change it. Warren Anderson is allowed to fly away after killing an entire city worth of people, and we couldn\\'t do shit about it.\\n\\nThere is corruption is every government office, kids are dying due to negligence in hospitals, people can\\'t eat the food they want to eat, people can\\'t hold hands in public or kiss, homosexuality is still illegal. Where the fuck are my rights? Courts are overburdened and cases go on for decades before a verdict is delivered. \"Sarkari Babus\" have no accountability, they don\\'t have to do their job, and yet somehow they are some of the richest people in the country, while farmers who break their backs working are committing suicides daily. Govt. can announce demonetization on a whim and we can\\'t do shit but stand in line for ATM. Parliament barely functions, they stage a walkout every other day so that they don\\'t have to do work. Unless they are discussing the matter of raising their own salaries, then they agree readily. Post something wrong about some leader on the internet and get arrested, invite members of opposite gender to your house as a bachelor and get fucked by the society. Is that how rights work?\\n\\nLong story short, the way I see it, for regular middle class/lower class people, there is no difference between the authoritarian regime of China and the \"Super Awesome, free and full of rights, DEMOCRATIC af\" India. Given that, the progress China has made is commendable, and we should be ashamed.\\n\\nIf you can afford it and have the skills, you should be taking steps to move out of india ASAP.\\n\\nYour thoughts? How far are we (whole society) to get rid of fake news as political propaganda? Guys, so many of us our fighting to save the soul of India, we need to collaborate and make it big...The same way our founding fathers aligned themselves. Any suggestions apart from fighting online what else can be done to actually bring a change. Love your work. But instead of just busting fake news, why not have a segment to clear big news ie the news that concerns the whole nation or the news which confuses people? Hello there. I’ve been away from india for a while now and would like to get myself informed about the major incidents and pressing issues. Unfortunately I have only seen incongruent information across media and internet, leaving me in confusion as to what I shall believe and what I shouldn’t. Being part of alt news, you’re most likely going to promote that - but I’d like to request you to point out how I shall check for news by weighing it? Yes there is bias check websites for media in general, but fact check is another thing. Would you please recommend me a source or two besides yours to follow for news? Very unrelated but :\\nWhat\\'s your favorite movie Using AI for fake news? Can you collaborate with Social media channels like Peeing Human or Soch channel to create videos which can be spread to wider audience?  This will help you reach out to more people through their videos. What is one good thing current government is doing right according to you? Do you think fake news and conspiracy theories are the new normal ? I mean are they here to stay or just something that is result of rise of right wing populism around the globe and will eventually end once right wing populism subsides. Love your work.\\n\\nWhat are your plans for the next steps?\\n\\nMight I put in a suggestion. So far your objective has been creating awareness and identifying fake news. Perhaps step 2 would be curbing the sources of fake news altogether. Once you identify accounts that are confirmed to spread fake news, put a note at the end of your article urging readers to report those accounts to twitter/facebook etc. Once enough readers have reported those accounts, they would need to be taken down. It wouldn\\'t change much but every time you shut an account with even 500 followers, that = one less account spreading shit. The other side may simply open multiple new accounts to spread more misinformation, but as long as they don\\'t have a significant following, that should not be an issue.\\n\\nYou have an engaged audience and this sort of action would not cost anything. Hi Pratik I am a huge fan of your work I have the following questions.\\n\\nHow can some one do basic fact checking by themselves? \\n\\nwhen will the altnews app coming out for ios?\\n\\nIs there anyway someone check if images or videos circulated are genuine or from a specific incident that is claimed? does that need special tools or can be done using google image search?\\n\\nThank you again for all the work that your team is  doing . you, zubair, the doc and the rest of your team. Thank you for all the amazing work !! \\n\\nAs a fellow techie here just curious about if this would be opensourced , can others also contribute to improve/add new features? You\\'re a legend. More power to you. I have no question, just want to thank you for the service you are providing to filter out fake news from the large dump. Will Arvind Kejriwal win 2020 election?\\n\\nWhat do you think of him? Heard of his work in education a lot Hi pratik...what about starting WhatsApp groups which disseminate the actual facts especially regarding WhatsApp forwards that are hugely circulated?\\n\\nI say WhatsApp since it\\'s the go to app for BJP IT cell and for other extremists apart  from Twitter and for other extremists\\n\\nLike I can submit a huge forwarded WhatsApp from those unkills / other extremists and then you guys could send us the truth do that we can fight back the vitriol..\\n\\nI genuinely believe that our creator (although you\\'re an atheist) just justice ultimately for all mankind. This is one of the ways by which wrongs through misinformation are reduced since the minority who actually cares can check before forming an opinion Hey pratik, I know the AMA is over and I am late, but do you guys plan on making a whatsapp bot which checks the message forwards to find if its fake or real news? If not do you have an api for your fake news debunk articles so that someone can make such a bot? Favourite news webistes in terms of writing quality and reliability? (international and national) Do you get threatened from those people/parties whose fake news you expose? Hello sir. I think yours is one of the most successful digital media outlets considering how indispensable your service is. I would like to ask how do we take this fight against fake news beyond Twitter and beyond intellectual dialogue. How do we take it to the normal masses. To the villages where rumours spread on WhatsApp end up in lunching incidents. \\n\\nMy second question is more of a request. False claims and fake news often manipulate election results in India. You do not take a stand that often because of being termed bias. Could you please do more towards making election campaigns more accountable ? Why don’t you guys do a tutorial of how you do fact checking? People think it’s mostly reverse image search but I’m sure there’s than that Hi Prateek\\nJust wanted to know if your team has any members who subscribe to a different ideology that you? I think for a true fact checking portal this is important in the long run as you and your personal ideology may determine the quality of articles you pick.\\nBy number you may be exposing both sides but may not be by quality.\\n\\nNevertheless you guys are doing a good job. Let me know if you plan to diversify the group to include diverse people with key decision making power. Can you put up Rankwise and Stats of Fake News, based on political parties? Who is #1 currently? I know the answer but can you give us an image? What you guys do for your security ..?.You are not getting afraid by any system which warns or threat about your reporting....?Because you all are doing a great job in truth reveal...hats off guys....If you guys have vacancy any then convey us also....We are in need👍 SIR,\\n\\n1) Are there any rules and regulations in  place legally which deals with offenders who spread such fake news which may lead to fear mongering, communal hate etc? If yes are there any from your personal experience that are dealt with??\\n\\n2) How inefficient you feel have social media companies like Facebook etc. have been to deal with the same??\\n\\n\\nThanks to you and the entire Alt news team, Keep up the good work......... Hi Pratik,\\n\\nThis is the first time I\\'ve heard about Alt News. I am interested in things from a technical point-of-view rather than journalistic.\\n\\n1. Do you think news orgs lack access to powerful search methods to dig up facts? For instance, going back in time to evaluate on-record statements; pulling out key quotes from previous interviews, searching for all news bites and reports on a particular person or organization on a particular topic, searching video and audio archives, difficulty in making sense of long legal documents, and so on.\\n2. You mentioned crowd-tangle and tweet-deck, what other tools do you think would help orgs like Alt News?\\n3. Have you thought about starting an internet-only (live) TV channel as opposed to a YouTube channel, say? If so, what hindrances do you foresee (licensing, legality, cost, reach-ability, technical feasibility, on-ground logistics)?\\n4. What are top three burning problems you wished tech solved for you, but hasn\\'t, or it has but is simply too cost-prohibitive?\\n5. What do you need to be able to compete with a deep-pocket propaganda machine like the BJP IT Cell and the rest of the sold-out Indian media?\\n\\nThanks for everything you do. Hi Pratik, thank you very much for doing AMA i really appreciate the work you\\'re doing. I would like to ask few questions.\\n\\n1.  According to you what we as a responsible citizens can do to fight with fake news? \\n\\n2. Whenever i show alt news to my friends and colleagues they accuse that it does selective checking and mainly target right-wing, can you tell me how to counter this accusation and what is your take on this.\\n\\n3. Are you planning to expand this and take it to in main stream media? If yes then how and when you\\'re planning to do? How is AltNews looking to secure the website/app? You never know which IT cell could hire who to start looking to find vulnerabilities and possibly hack into your systems. What are the technical challenges that you face as a fact checking company? I\\'m very curios about the tools you use. Are you looking into a way to automatically reply to any shared fake news (at least on Twitter) with the Alt News link to the related article?\\n\\nSorry for the tirade of questions, last one: How do you think we can combat Whatsapp, since WA seems to be the primary hotbed of fake news and propaganda. 1) At what percentage fake news graph spikes during elections?\\n2) What’s your criteria of selection of fake news?\\n3) How many Fake news you think originated on daily basis?\\n4) Didn’t you contact Social media platform to filter out fake news from their site?\\n5) Why don’t you ask or take help from the people to volunteer your PR work on no charge basis? Hi Pratik,\\n\\nI am a huge fan of Alt News and it is my go-to source to bust Whatsapp and twitter Noise and false news.\\n\\nI just want you to be more open about your personal life since your Father was associated to Teesta Setalvad\\'s organisation which is under trial for various things.\\n\\nThis has not stopped me from supporting alt news but I just want you to clear the air around this since I know for a fact from your past interviews that your parents have been Activists and flag-bearers to seek justice for the people affected by the 2002 Godhra/Gujarat riots.\\n\\nMy question thus are:\\n\\n1. Is your rivalry now personal with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah since they were acquitted on the 2002 case by the SC \\n\\n2. You have been vocal and political in your opinions on twitter. Do you plan to join mainstream politics given enough support \\n\\n\\n3. Is AltNews ambitions itself to be a full fledged news channel of India given the change in regime and a left of centre government in place\\n\\n4. Do politicians LW/RW call you guys up and heckle you to delete/place a fake news and then bust them\\n\\nI am asking these to add transparency to the good work you are doing. How did people reacted to you editing BJP IT cell tweets? Could they accuse you for manipulating tweets especially for the verified accounts and did you received calls ? How would they reacted to it if it was something like ugly truth of RSS or BJP or something about 2002. Have you thought about some kind of certification for recognition? A lot of people still don\\'t know altnews. Pointing out misinfo/disinfo has the unintended side effect of giving misinfo/disinfo more attention. Trump has proved it hardly matters to him. And everyone world over seems to be following his lead in increasing their propaganda wings activities.\\n\\nSome people such as Tim Wu (of net neutrality fame) think rather than pointing at misinfo/disinfo pointing at positive/other stuff gives these operations less oxygen to keep burning. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think? How to contact you, Pratik Sir? If one dwells in your own city... Do you report on the naxals? If so, how do you portray their circumstances? Hi Pratik\\nDo you think we can help? I think people who follow you already follow right side of politics. Can we include bhakts? Can we do better PR? Can we help? Lot of us are techies. 1. Can you suggest news sources one should receive information from? I currently use inshorts app as daily source of information \\n\\n2. How is PIB as daily source of information? I mean it is still a government organisation. It\\'s hard to trust government organisations these days\\n\\n3. PIB has started debunking fake news now, do you see that as competition? Is taxation theft? [removed] Which other fact checking websites/pages would you recommend besides Altnews in India? How do you feel about the internet ban and what can be done to cover events happening in such areas? [Comments Ngo?](https://i.imgur.com/7iEjKix.jpg) I am doing my BSc I want to work with you, I don\\'t have experience in this but I still want to please inform me whenever you guys need some people. Do you believe Twitter and Facebook are unwilling to tackle RW hate speech and fake news on their platforms in India due to Govt pressure?\\n\\nSome of the RW handles constantly peddle fake news blatantly but Twitter doesn\\'t seem to care. Do you find this unusual?\\n\\nAlso, between Twitter and FB who do you think is doing a better job in tackling these issues? Hi Pratik,what made u quit your job?...also were you working on part time projects as a software engineer? You and the rest of the Alt News team is doing a great job. It\\'s highly needed in this day and age. That said, I can\\'t help but think Alt News and other similar organizations must only exist within certain echo chambers. People who already know they can\\'t trust everything that comes across would follow fake news busters and trust them but people who blindly follow certain fake news peddlers won\\'t follow organizations like yours and even if they did, they\\'d discredit anything you published.  \\n\\n\\\\- Have you thought of ways or tried to reach out to such people?  \\n\\\\- What are the biggest challenges you faced during the transition from an engineer to essentially a journalist and founder.\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'m sure there are other people in similar position as you were and want to dedicate more time to do social good but are afraid to essentially quit a career they\\'ve spent decades building. Any advice for such people?\\n\\n\\\\- How does Alt News sustain itself? Is there a business model and has it worked or shown signs of working?\\n\\n\\\\- Does Alt News have any programs for part-time voluntary work people might want to do? I imagine software engineers, writers, security experts, journalists etc could all help out. Any other organizations you might recommend such people to volunteer for? Great work you guys are doing at Altnews. This is something that is much needed. More power to you! How do we get in contact with you if we find something that needs to be fact corrected? This is amazing. My question is whether the below informatiom is significantly true or not, it\\'s imperative i get the truth on this. Eagerly waiting for your response on this please. \\n\\n\"... in 2014 when new govt came to power BJP had launched the namami ganga .\\n\\nThe Delhi STP project is under the Yamuna Action Plan and is part of the Namami Gange initiative project where each state where Ganga and Yamuna flows from was asked to execute X number of STP plants which will be partially funded by the center. Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were the 1st states to reject these adivisory in 2014. In 2014 UP had mayavati and Akhilesh Yadav and in Bengal our favorite world renowned Didi. So 85% of the Delhi STP is funded by Modi Govt .\\n\\n2) The place exactly where this statue of unity is built . It’s built on Narmada dam (Kevadia ) , want to know what it does to 4 states ? Read about it .\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardar_Sarovar_Dam\\n\\n3) Under the Yogi government, Ganga got a new life in Kanpur .\\nSounds apple to apple comparison ?\\nMedia wont show, youtube link is not popular too as water wont look blue in India ever.\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/pqZHHy9cV3w\\n\\nIt was proposed and funded by center but not advertised as its their job, but Kejriwal taking the credit alone is wrong. \\n\\nAlso, Statue of Unity is among the top 100 places to visit, I agree it costed way to much but we should invest in creating history also or else if we loose our old monuments, what will we have for the new generation...\\n\\nBut yeah, good initiative and great execution thanks to Nitin Gadkari and Kejriwal for support.\" How to spot enemies proning in Sanhok? Ok Is the world war 3 going to happen?\\nBetter that i start gathering anti radiation suits and masks ! How do you make sure that the information or news you post is not biased? Hi Pratik, can you pls share your email address? Thanks. Do you receive any adverse threats from the IT cells? WHY are you AMA now huh? Where were you when <insert historical event>??? Hi Prateek. I am really thankful for the great work that you are doing for society as a whole.\\n\\nMy question, have you noticed the parallels between the propaganda carried out in India and in the US by respective leading political parties? There is a huge parallel in the content of comments. Is there a report on this, or have you investigated this before? How we peoples remove this Government soon? Where can I donate, and is the donation tax deductible lol? Hello Prateik,\\n\\nSince you are working to combat fake news, want to ask you why profiles who post edited videos from IT cell are freely doing it without facing any punishment. Best place in Delhi to learn fact check? Any placs you would recommend? How to join as photojournalist? [removed] - Do political parties or sources from them contact you and tell you about the fake news they\\'ve seen and provide you the facts too, to counter it? Is there anything you do besides taking screenshots? What\\'s your work flow? Since you\\'re a small team and you could be dealing with a lot of data. Agree and whole-heartedly appreciate your philosophy of not associating with \\'mainstream\\' media houses. They are ones who honestly (and sadly) need to be fact-checked the hardest.\\n\\nMy question is - Have you approached/been approached by any political party/organisation to support/ally with you in the fight against misinformation? \\nThis might sound convoluted, but what I mean is not the parties that actually generate and propagate fake news, but the few parties that actually care or atleast show that they care about countering the propaganda machine of the BJP? \\nI have seen a few politicians (or even a few public personalities-turned politicians) who actually share your fact-checks - (of course it can be argued, for their own political benefit) quite openly on social media to counter the ruling regime\\'s propaganda. A few names that come to mind are Yogendra Yadav, Kavita Krishnan, Jignesh Mevani. The list might just include two or three more names, but still, aren\\'t they worth allying/associating with? \\n\\nI am not saying that Alt News should take sides or put out it\\'s political affiliations out in the public (I know you\\'ve said you don\\'t have any, which is brilliant), but in the quest for a wider fight against misinformation, do you think it would be good to have an actual politician (however small/inconsequential) to associate with you in the fight against fake news and state on public record that they will NEVER spread fake information willingly? You can have a list of politicians whom YOU have verified (and not Twitter), so that they will atleast be accountable to that standard, which in turn will only give Alt News more legitimacy in the eyes of the common man? And, at the same time take away the political legitimacy of anybody who doesn\\'t adhere to that standard. (I am also aware of the pitfalls of placing Alt News on such a high pedestal, but you are accountable to your patrons in some way or the other). In my opinion, this seems to be the next logical level to take the fight to. \\n\\nJust want to know your opinion on this. Otherwise, huge fan of yours. :) Keep the good work going. Is there a recurring donation / subscription model for alt-news? what\\'s the veracity of your verified news? I see there are 3 major fact check websites - Alt News for the left, OpIndia for the right and Boom Live for the center. Do you compete for market share and presence. Which one among these is the market leader in India. 1. Is citizenship amendment act a bigger gold mine than demonetization, aadhaar and BCCI combined?\\n2. Suppose you are removed from citizenship list and government official/politician ask you to part away with half of your assets to grant you amnesty, will you accept it?

I\\'ll try to contact his father. One of my closest school friends is KP, but I don\\'t think he\\'s on Reddit\\n\\nHis entire family is very happy about the decision of course My ex gf was, but eh, we don\\'t talk any more. Got another opinion from a friend: \\n\\n\"Answering as Kashmiri Pandit (KP) born in 1990, we lost our home, business, identity, culture, health and became refugee in our own country. No amount of  compensation can make KPs to go back because of one simple reason we lost trust in other community. My generation has heard and read horror stories of migration and how our kashmiri brothers watched while we were butchered. We don\\'t know what future holds but exodus of my community will always be darkest chapter in the history of Kashmir. I dont know about others but I wont be able to ever go back. Its not to the point and emotions get in the way. Getting government assigned flats and houses is a good deal but it doesn\\'t change the fact we lost our heritage and culture.\"\\n\\nAlso he suggested you google Girja tickoo and Satish tickoo and read \"Our moon has blood clots\" Kashmiri here, however, under 30.  \\nI will try to get someone to get your questions answered. I asked someone who is Kashmiri and above 30 years. Below is  his view :\\n\\n\"I  think everyone has his view point. One has to answer these questions today or tomorrow as these are the relevant questions. We still do not understand our position yet and what government of India has decided for us. Are we still migrants or that tag has been removed from us ? The situation says wait and watch.\" Ama request. Rahul Pandita. KP was old enough to understand what was going on in 90s and Young enough to say us his opinions. RemindMe! 1 day Can we get anupam kher to do an ama? I\\'m 26 and from the Kashmiri Pandit community. Given my age, I agree that I\\'m not in the best position to answer OP\\'s questions but I can take a stab if they\\'re still interested. But below are some general thoughts if anyone\\'s interested:\\n\\nMy parents were forced to leave Kashmir in 1989-90 and move to a place at the other end of the country where I grew up. They haven\\'t been back since - just briefly for a week on vacation to show me what it\\'s like about 15 years ago. And it\\'s sad and terrible. But, it\\'s possible to recognize the plight of Kashmiri Hindus that had their lives uprooted overnight 30 years ago while also recognizing that what\\'s happening right now is upsetting, undemocratic and unconstitutional. \\n\\nUnfortunately, Indians (and the KP community to a large degree) has been consumed by bloodlust and it\\'s fucking saddening. What\\'s worse - and I find bewildering - is how none from the KP community were in support of repealing 370 until Modi showed up in 2014 and they realized this would be a way to unleash a fresh hell in Kashmir under the garb of \"patriotism\" and \"unification\" (perhaps I\\'m projecting too much malice on to their intentions when I should chalk it up to stupidity and propaganda). I don\\'t think the community itself stands to gain a lot from this. \\n\\nThe most honest analysis is that historically, a lot of parties - including those suffering the most today - fucked up but no one took ownership then and now it\\'s just spiraled out of control after how oppressive the Indian government has been there. You expect States to be reasonable actors in these situations and not stoop to the level of terrorists because either way, it\\'s the common person who\\'s affected the most. And, as things stand today, while the Kashmiri Hindus have been rehabilitated elsewhere to a reasonable degree, more than two generations of Kashmiris who stayed in Kashmir (primarily Muslims and Sikh) grew up in the world\\'s most militarized zone. I\\'m extremely pessimistic about the situation. I am quite certain that we\\'re living through the creation of another West Bank here. I am a Kashmiri Pandit, I turn 30 in a few months. I know many Kashmir Pandits over 30, including my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles.\\n\\n1. I am of the opinion that Kashmir will be violent in the short term. Extremist violence is common in Kashmir, why should this situation be any different?\\n2. We will never return to Kashmir, outside of the occasional very short trip. I have been to Kashmir once in my life, despite my father begging me not to go, for my safety. I had to see the place that haunts my entire family, at least once. My father has been back once since the 1980s. The handful of elderly relatives that remained are slowly dying off. \\n3. Our ancestral house was sold under duress while my family was in exile. Our neighbors are the onces who forced us to sell, under threat of violence. The bones still exist, but it was turned into a shopping mall. We won\\'t return because we\\'ll never feel safe. \\n4. My family was not provided housing by the government of India. We were privileged enough to pay for our own housing. Many family members settled in the Delhi area and have done well for themselves since. Some family members  have moved to the US, Dubai, Singapore and elsewhere and have also done quite well for themselves. I know that my family is not the kind of Pandit you\\'re asking the question about, but it is true that the Kashmiri diaspora has very little incentive to come back as they have rather good lives outside of Kashmir. Of course, those who are still refugees are different, but come on - Kashmri Pandits who have a modicum of success aren\\'t moving back to a remote valley with poor infrastructure and a majority of inhabitants that could want us dead at any moment. \\n5. Yes. The reservation was an ill-intentioned policy that failed Kashmiris and prevented the proper integration of Kashmir with India.\\n\\nI am by no means a Hindu nationalist and I think the Indian government deserves plenty of blame for the situation in Kashmir as well as the plight of Kashmiri Pandits (as does the Pakistini government, and Kashmiri Muslims).\\n\\nFrankly, I think Kashmiri Pandits are beside the point in this discussion, because Kashmiri Muslims succeeded in exterminating our culture. Without anchoring to the homeland, there aren\\'t enough of us to carry it forward and those numbers continue to dwindle as we marry non-Kashmiris. In a generation or two, Kashmiri Pandits will cease to exist in any meaningful way and no policy will save that so policy making shouldn\\'t consider \"our plight\"\\n\\nPolicy making should have considered our plight 30 years ago, but now it\\'s too late. Without internet and swarm of Bharat ke garam naujawan in reddit. I think I can see if no one turns up. In past perspective from Kashmiris were not well received by virath Bharat ke veer on this sub.

Let’s assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n> Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n> Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over $1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would have been won.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n> By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably write books on “How I turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet, they’ll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors with, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n> By then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much the same — 215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips.\" Kudos on crossing 1cr on trading. I have a couple of questions for you.\\n\\n1. What got you into trading in the first place. Any insight into your background?\\n\\n2. What was the learning curve involved.\\nHow did you reach where you are right now? Can you break it up into the skills (and necessary sources) and other resources needed to start off? How did you start learning. How can begginers learn to do this. Thanks for the AMA. \\n\\n1. Is this your full time job or you do it part time?\\n2.

I’ve made a few thousands trading but mostly I am holding long because I can’t win consistently in intraday. What strategy should I use? Also, which TA tool is the best?

Intra day trader! I actually don’t believe in technicals, charts don’t work. That’s why most of the intra day traders don’t make it. But the people look at the candles and what not and still make money. May be it works but I just can’t bring myself to believe it does. Congrats to you though for making lots of money! Congrats Would you do an AMA after you lose your money too? I want to start trading too, what are the formal procedures(bank accounts etc) to get started and how to choose a broker.\\nAlso suggest the simplest way to get started Few questions : \\na) What percentage of your trade are Intraday ? \\nb) How long on an average are your non intraday trades ?\\nc) if there are 10 metrics you measure for making a buy/sell call what are those ? would love to know some of the statistics on your trades. especially win/loss ratio, number of trades. I am en engineer by profession and would like to explore the world of trading. I have absolutely 0 knowledge on the subject. I just read you recommending Rupee tales by Zerodha. Any Youtube channels instead? Thanks for the AMA. I have always looked down upon trading as everyone I know lost their money in the market (my dad, my mama etc). I am in a comfortable place in IT right now and I can take a bit of the risk with my money. Please know that I know absolutely nothing about trading.\\n\\nI see you recommend zerodha varsity. But the question is, can one start with capital as small as 1 lakh? Just to test the waters? Would you recommend intraday trading for a guy with a regular 9 - 5 job? I feel there are two knowledge components: one is understanding the technical stuff like what is a short. \\n\\nThe other part is following the industry - daily news and analysis which allows you to make informed decisions. What sources do you recommend for this?\\n\\nWhat is your view on Zerodha smallcases? I don\\'t have the time to trade intraday. Is it viable to make money through swing trading over a few days? Kind of a stupid question. Which brokerage firm do you use for trading? Who provides the best online platform for trading in India? WoW. Congrats Manu vai.

I\\'m not 18 legally. But I started trading through my father this year. I turned 10K to 13.5K in March when I started, then bought ALBK. My father said I\\'m making too many trades. So I\\'m waiting till August to invest via my own account. I have a few questions, and anybody can answer them:\\n\\n1. How do I invest 10K? There is no way I can increase my capital or whatever 10K is. I really want to trade and learn the craft.\\n\\n2. Which online broker should I use?\\n\\n3. How do I stay on top of the news? Wanted to understand about your technique. These signals that you talk about, they automatically which means you are using an API? Which brokers provide a good set. Also, any of them provide intraday volumes as well along with price? Investing is mostly going against the tide (buy stocks with bearish sentiments) whereas trading is going with the tide (follow market sentiments).  \\nHow much do you agree with the above statement? Do you believe in technical analysis? Especially in intraday trading. Hi Manu, I am regular 24 year old with a job that doesn\\'t allow me to day trade. However, i\\'d still like to get started with investing: trading, funds and other financial instruments to supplement my income. Where can I start? Are there any courses you would suggest?\\n\\nI do not mind paying for training on how to invest. I only ask that it fits into my lifestyle, and doesn\\'t require me to invest multiple hours at end. Hey man, late to the party. NRI swing trader here and what you\\'re doing is beyond my ultimate dream so I have a few questions for you.\\n\\n1. Did you test your strategies on international markets (like on demo accounts). I\\'m curious if it\\'s work on NASDAQ and NYSE\\n\\n2. Do you place both long and short positions or just long?\\n\\n3. It\\'s a very bullish market. If I had invested in almost any tech stock a year ago, I\\'d have doubled my money. What makes your strategy stand out?\\n\\n5. Did your position size get bigger as your account grew or did you always trade with same size.\\n\\n4. Any tips to make 2% a week? just couple days ago was thinking about you wondering where are you right now. and bamm here you are. Would you say that to trade successfully it needs to be a full-time job? Meaning someone occupied 10 hours every day in another job can\\'t possibly spare the time to learn the right information. This is some WSB level shit. You are quoting 30% returns as predictable in your comments. It’s all fun and games when we are in a 10 year bull market but I feel bad for the idiots who’re going try this and lose everything!\\n\\nYeah I made a killing betting on tech stocks over the past two years but I’m not stupid enough to claim my intelligence had anything to do with it. I\\'m not from a business/engineering background. Got no idea about trading but know that starting early is better. I\\'m already in my early 20s. What do I do? How do I start investing with minimal income? What will be your advice to someone who doesn\\'t know anything about trading but wants to make money of it. How do I start? Hey congrats question do you keep tight Stop-loss for your strategy means in terms of profit in percent how much is your stop-loss for each trade? Have you ever thought increasing capital impacts return of your strategy due to slippage? What was the purpose of this AMA? You didn\\'t dispense any misconceptions about trading. Whatever you have answered is completely useless or something people can \"GOOGLE\". Most of the things you said, you have said in a vague manner. People ask you for guidance regarding materials to study, some sort of structure, and you say \"ZERODHA VARSITY\" in every single answer - like you\\'re promoting Zerodha. Everyone knows Zerodha will fuck you up one day or another. You haven\\'t gone into detail in any of the answers, every answer is vague, useless, and unhelpful. And on top of this, you ask people to \"GOOGLE\" stuff as if they don\\'t know.\\n\\nIt looks like the sole purpose of this ama and the one before this was to show off. You haven\\'t dispensed anything, you haven\\'t helped anyone through these two amas. Almost all the things you have said in a vague manner, most people know. This ama is like a \"fuck you mediocre people, look at me - i made 1 crore+ with 30L capital\".\\n\\nIf you want to know what a thoroughly useful and out and out brilliant AMA (what it is supposed to be) - check out [https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9s9d7/iama\\\\_100\\\\_automated\\\\_independent\\\\_retail\\\\_trader\\\\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9s9d7/iama_100_automated_independent_retail_trader_i/)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow, that guy is frickin useful and down to earth and is properly giving useful information and putting people on a path/direction. You are useless dude. 244 comments and all I can see is Zerodha Varsity. You don\\'t have to discuss your strategies, but what the heck are you gonna lose by discussing the top books that you have read which helped, or the step by step procedure for system building, the challenges you have faced, the journey you have taken as a trader, etc. You say you have been trading for 10+ years on and off, and yet you don\\'t even discuss your early years, how they shaped you, etc. This was a totally stupid ama. Hello friend. I am learning for investing into stock I am learning by watching youtube videos. Can you guide what would be a better way to learn more into investing stocks? Background: I used to work for a large hedge fund in a technology role. The hedge fund employed quantitative strategies in addition to a large array of research analysts.\\n\\nI have been trading on my own for more than a year. I have had some great profits, and great losses.\\n\\nI wrote this for all those who think they can make quick money in the market by choosing a security and choosing a time and direction. Listen up.\\n\\nYou are an uninformed trader. You do not have any special information about the future which is not also available to the professionals.\\n\\nAll \"easy\" informed trading is done almost immediately by computers. An example is: stock A is at $10. There is new information which is clearly bullish. Within a second, the stock will be at $12. The new price reflects the new information. You cannot beat the computers at informed trading.\\n\\nNew \"complex\" information about an asset has to be analysed and accepted by others for it to be trade-worthy. You can not hope to be a better analyst than professionals who have training, tools and access to insiders. That doesn\\'t mean all analysts are right or in agreement, but only that their opinion is more informed than yours. Again, you cannot hope to profit using analysis of \"complex\" information if the market doesn\\'t agree with you. Reading a Seeking Alpha article (and the comments) is not analysis.\\n\\nAfter the information is priced in, any further price movement is driven by supply-demand and not by new information. You cannot guess at supply-demand. It happens in real time and big traders fiercely protect the content of their future orders. I laugh at people who buy $TWTR AFTER getting the information that Jack Dorsey also bought some last week. There may be a sentiment rally if others start buying, there may not be. You really don\\'t know.\\n\\nCharting is useful only in hindsight. Prior price/volume action has no bearing on future price/volume action. You say pivot points? Let us say SPY is reaching 237.00 from above. Everybody says it is an important \"support\". What does that mean? Will it break that support or not? If it breaks, will it go much lower, or bounce back up to reclaim the support? Again, you don\\'t know. Today SPY broke and bounced off that support 3 or 4 times before definitively breaking down. Which break-down is definitive? It is only clear in hindsight.\\n\\nNow, all the above should make it clear that, in essence, you are an uninformed trader, that is, you are trading blind. That means, charitably speaking, that your chances of the asset moving in a favorable direction are 50-50.\\n\\nBut still you will lose. There are two reasons for this. One relates to the way trades happen, and other is about human psychology.\\n\\n(a) If you place a limit buy or limit sell, your order will only execute while the ticker is moving unfavorably to you. \\n  That is, if the stock is moving down from your limit buy price, your buy order will execute. And if it is moving up beyond your limit sell price, your sell order will execute. In each case (unless you are closing a trade), you are immediately at a loss as the price continues its movement.\\n\\n( If the price is not moving much, you are immediately at a loss due to the bid/ask spread.  And you likely bought because you thought it was a bargain and the recent past showed a downward price movement and you were bullish on it.  More often than not, price movement continues in the same direction.  Reversals are rare and hard to time.)\\n\\nThis means, that\\n\\n(b) You immediately are in pain. You see a loss and will likely see it widening as the price movement continues.\\n\\nNow you have many options:\\n\\ni) You can exit the trade at a loss. Bummer.\\n\\nii) You can execute another trade in the same direction to average your price. This again suffers from the same problem. The price is moving away from you while all your orders execute. Your new trade is as uninformed as the last one.\\n\\niii) You can hold the bag, \"hoping\" for a reversal.\\n\\nBoth in (ii) and (iii), you are now holding the bag.\\n\\nLet us talk about that.\\n\\nUsually, the price will continue to move while you see the red becoming redder. You regret the trade. You are stressed. You have averaged it 3, maybe 4 times already. You want to at least exit at break-even.\\n\\nTherefore, as soon as the price reverses and it shows you a modest profit, you will itch to book the profit and relax. Hence, you will make the all-too-common (but understandable) trader mistake of holding your losers and quitting your winners. After the trade shows some green, because you have experienced the red, you will be afraid that it will again go red. You will be wanting to not go through that pain again.\\n\\nTherefore you will usually see losers in your portfolio with a loss % of 20 or even 50, but you will never see that kind of profit %. Ever. You would have booked the profit at 2% or 5%.\\n\\nSo what\\'s the consequence? Even assuming each trade has a 50-50 chance of going your way, your losses will always be bigger than your winners.\\n\\nEventually, you will curse trading and seek gainful employment.\\n\\nHope it was helpful.\\n\\n What about if you use stop limits with market orders and trade into \"momentum\"? This can work, some of the time.  How do you determine that the momentum is going to continue and not reverse soon after?  But the main problem is the stops.  If you have a tight stop, volatility will take you out.  If you have a wide stop, your loss will be wide too.  Figuring out a proper stop based on \"pivot points\" and past realized volatility is not that straightforward, but it can work if enough other people believe in your pivot point too.\\n\\nI still trade, but am a more humble trader after the experiences.  It is possible to develop an edge, but it takes specialized skills and hard work.\\n\\nTL;DR: If you don\\'t have a well-defined edge, you cannot hope to day trade for profit in the long term.

Thodi der Reddit kya nahi dekha reverse AMA khatam bhi hogaya Story Time : Crush was in a long term relationship, we used to talk a lil bit in the office. First year of office we had formed several groups, people who would hang together, party together etc. I tried to pull her into our group (coz her group was a lame group that I felt was just 3girls and their admirers) . Me and a wingman would try to get her to join us on tea breaks, house parties etc but the fffin girls in our group just wouldn\\'t let her feel accepted so that didn\\'t happen.\\n\\nI would flirt a little, as much was acceptable in an office environment. She would come sit on my desk sometimes to talk, so it seemed like we were on good terms. I honestly had no intention of  going after someone that was already taken but she was nice to be around.\\n\\nThen I learned that shes hit a rough patch in her relationship. She didnt tell me this herself so I couldn\\'t outwardly react to this development. Same sources confirmed that the breakups final, I was overjoyed but counting days thinking it would be insensitive to try to make a move right away.\\n\\nIts Valentines day and I\\'m are out with a few friends for drinks. She walks into the same joint and I light up, this may be the best time to make a move I think. I pull her to the bar counter, get her a drink and we take a couple jabs at each other, then notice a guy standing a little bit behind her eyeing me. She introduces him as a friend. I ask them to join us at our table, they say they have other friends incoming. We part ways.\\n\\nCut to Last week. She married that guy. He proposed on THAT DAY.\\n\\nTLDR : While I was waiting like an ass for an appropriate amount of time to pass after her breakup, this dude moved in like a hawk and was the kandha she needed I guess. I have learned my lesson, Never again. Listened to Bohemian Rhapsody for the first time.\\n\\nI dunno what happened and I love it.

It unravels intricacies\\nof the subject through a dialogue between Teacher and Student I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. For me this\\nsemed to be one of the few books which teach a difficult subject through inquisition, and using programmed\\nconcept for learning After that book, Dr Harish Chandra Verma\\'s book on physics, CONCEPTS OF PHYSICS is\\nanother such attempt, even though it is not directly in the dialogue form. I have thoroughly appreciated it. It\\nis dear that Dr Verma has spent considerable time in formulating the structure of the book, besides its contents\\nI think he has been successful in this attempt. Dr Verma\\'s book has been divided into two parts because of the\\nsite of the total manuscript. There have been several books on this subject, each one having its own flavour\\nHowever, the present book is a totally different attempt to teach physics, and I am sure it will be extremely\\nuseful to the undergraduate students. The exposition of each concept is extremely lucid. In carefully formatted\\nchapters, besides problems and short questions, a number of objective questions have also been included. This\\nbook can certainly be extremely useful not only as a textbook, but also for preparation of various competitive\\nexaminations\\nThose who have followed Dr Verma\\'s scientific work always enjoyed the outstanding contributions he has\\nmade in various research areas. He was an outstanding student of Physics Department of IIT Kanpur during\\nhis academic career. An extremely methodical, sincere person as a student, he has devoted himself to the task\\neducating young minds and inculcating scientific temper amongst them. The present venture in the form of\\nthese two volumes is another attempt in that direction. I am sure that young minds who would like to learn\\nphysics in an appropriate manner will find these volumes extremely useful\\nI must heartily congratulate Dr Harish Chandra Verma for the magnificent job he has done.*\\n\\n*YR Waghmare*\\n\\n*Professor of Physics*\\n\\n*IIT Kanpur.* AMA because everyone else is doing so Hobbs and Shaw worth watching? andi mandi shandi, jo LNRDT par AMA karega....

I am typical Indian IT male (IIM) with average academics. \\n\\nReason for MBA: I am working in IT service industry for past 9 years and always intrested in learning and growing. But now my growth is staganat and only option is to get into Management. So why not get MBA Degree and jump state career as manager in IT.\\n\\nShould I do MBA ? \\n\\nKeep looking buddy you will find the Job soon. Is it worth doing an MBA, if even without it you\\'re earning that much within roughly 4 years of graduating? Vaguely related, but as a non Indian it has always wondered me why so many people start an MBA at such a young age in India. In the Netherlands (where I am from) it is considered very weird to do an MBA without having at least around 4-5 years of work experience. Combined with the fact that most people enter the workforce here at a later age as well results in most people taking their MBA while being in their late 20s/early 30s. And isn\\'t that the original purpose of an MBA anyway, to do it only after having a decent amount of experience (but I might be misguided here)? It\\'s been tough, but while searching for new openings I hope you\\'re also enjoying this free period while it lasts ( hope it doesn\\'t last too much though).  \\n   \\nBtw apart from the money you made, you regret anything about the professional world of the elites? What job role were you doing? Which location are you looking for? MBA in what?\\nI may be able to refer you if something matches. will you work in a company that would pay 20%-30% less than your previous pay? Among HR, marketing and finance if you had to pick one which would you select based on the demand? Was the company a startup? Campus placement? Can relate to this situation. Hope you land a good job!   \\nIncase you are looking for some leads, do DM. We are hiring in my team. Need good finance knowledge. How/Why did your company go bankrupt? At what age did you get your job at 1.4 lakhs pm ? What was your CAT %ile/GMAT? (Optional :P)\\n\\nDo you regret taking a niche job instead of consulting/IB etc. ?\\n\\nDoes your academic history before MBA matter much after MBA? Why did it fail? And what do you think the founders/management could have done differently to save it? What would have you done? \\n\\nAlso, is the product still \\'out there\\'? I feel joy in reviving past/broken/failed products, if only money was a constraint. alumni help nahi karta ? [deleted] Bhai, when i read your story, I had to check whether I had posted it myself. Only difference is I was fired for factors within and without my control. I had taken this unemployment thing a bit lightly - my company gave me three months time to find another job. The first month went with a flurry of interview from good companies - flunked them all since I was under prepared and tensed.\\nThe second month, I took a step back, started reading and playing PUBG. I am now in the third month and have recently started applying. You situation seems to have added a sense of urgency now and thank you for that. I am currently not too worked up since I have the finances to pay off the loan and live unemployed for quite a few months at home.\\n\\nHowever the prospect of continued unemployment is now looking a bit worrisome. I have started working on constructive habits such as waking up at 6:00 AM, meditating, exercising - key habits that have let me down in the past and hopefully will help me in the future. I am more concerned how my parents will react  - I haven\\'t told them yet. \\n\\nAny help in this regard will very helpful. It\\'s unclear if you \"can\\'t find a job\" because of being picky about offers or because you haven\\'t gotten an offer.   \\nEither way, your asset is the network, not the degree. Check your college email ID for job leads. Post on your alumni telegram and whatsapp groups, preferably also the city group and not only the batch group. And spend less time on reddit till this is over.  \\n\\n\\nSource: Am a 1.6lpm \"elite\" MBA who can find a job any week of the month 1.6lpm on paper or in hand? \\n\\nAny previous experience prior to MBA? \\nMBA in what? \\n\\nPM me your resume, will refer in my company if I like it. Salary shouldn\\'t be a problem if you are good. First of all sorry for your situation. Have you tried working in start ups for stocks rather than huge salary? The reason I am asking this is because, I am from a similar B school and initially I worked in a small start up for gaining experience. With just a 5 minute video, I want you to help me understand with real examples about what you studied in MBA and what type of things you do on job.\\n\\nBecause a lot of people say \"Bro become a software developer they earn 2.3lpm\" but very few people talk about the annoying and nerdy codes they write for hours. What about job referrals through buddies? Beyond a point depending on recruiters doesnt make sense... especially if you are in 1.6lpa bracket. Dear OP,\\nPlease tell me which area of business you want to work in - Ops, Analytics, HR, Finance or Strategy. If you wish it so, I can help you with a referral at my current org, provided there are matching opportunities and you are also similarly inclined.\\nThanks. Get to Bangalore, make a list of 50 companies and walk into their offices with a flower bouquet and 2 senior contact names. Ask to meet them and ask for a job.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTwo companies per day and in four weeks, you will have atleast a dozen leads. Is your salary expectation a factor? Are you Lord of the rings fan? What did you major in before your MBA? I hope you won\\'t mind answering \\n\\nI am doing btech rn in a relatively new field (biotechnology) I have absolutely no interest in research and would like to get into a corporate job.\\nHow exactly should I plan my career?\\nI am planning on finishing my degree, get a job, leave it after a year or two and get an MBA and get back to the corporate world.\\n\\nAlso, have you tried getting a job abroad? Hey Bro! There are lots of referral groups on WhatsApp and other social media for Top MBA college students. You can try subscribing to those. A lot of my friends having your mentioned salary switched jobs using these groups. Okay. Prepared for the down-votes so here goes. Sorry bout your situation, but this is only the start of an epidemic. Our gen needs to wake up from this MBA gold rush. Working as an AI programmer, I can bet my balls this is a trend that will grow exponentially in the coming years.\\n\\nManagement is a dead industry. Why? Cause A.I! Management is part of occupations that you can  term \\'pseudo-expertise\\'. When a $12/month EC2 cluster can be trained to make the same decisions as you why would I expend 40L/year? That\\'s just reality and the sooner we get with it the better.\\n\\n**Free advice the you\\'re probably not gonna take:**\\nStash that IIM MBA in dadaji\\'s peti, learn some basic programming and get an advanced degree in Analytics.\\n\\nedits: mobile -> web fixes to sound less like an asshole; grammatical what was your cg in college?  and did they consider it for the b-school?

Thanks for posting, this has been very informative for someone planning on getting lasik. lasik se tum gori ho gayi ho..\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n/s [deleted] I got this procedure done 3 years ago. AMA Can cylindrical correction be fixed via Lasik? How does it feel being a girl on r/india ?  How many DMs you have got till now? Did your office cover it? Or personal expense? How much vision did you get back. ?\\n\\nI got 90% back.\\n\\n&#x200B; Has this boosted your confidence? And do people act differently around you since you no longer wear glasses?  How many years did you wear glasses for? It sounds weird but I've worn glasses for half my life and I feel like it'll be weird to get used to not having them (though I'd love to not be dependent on them all the time) Do you think not having glasses now has changed your personality in some ways? I got mine done in 2013, I wonder how much has changed since then. I have the same power. Can you give me your specs? lol my brother got a lasik recently, now he is the hot one. So you got your surgery done and doctors advised to avoid screen exposure and here you are hosting AMA. Good god, lady, go and sleep. LASIK gang hi5. Got it done 3yrs back. Was -6.\\n\\nAlso, I got cooler shades after the procedure. Huh!  Exact procedure name? \\n\\nHospital?\\n\\nTotal cost?\\n\\nTotally corrected or you still need glasses? [deleted] What is the cost of the treatment?  Why do you look more excited before surgery than after it though? Btw was your vision stable for a few years? How long did the full procedure take? Is LASIK risk free?  I get anxiety thinking I might lose my sight. Did insurance cover your surgery? How have you adjusted to your non glasses look? Did you asked your doctor about PRK? If so did he recommended it? Damn. I feel like a retard. People are asking question while I'm scratching my head because I didn't understand the post itself Did you have astigmatism? I’d like to correct my vision, but apparently I’m not a good candidate because of astigmatism.   Getting lasik done was one of the best decision of my life. it's been five years now. Having thick specs throughout school added to my introversion and social anxiety and kind of made me waste a lot of years under insecurities. after lasik, being active was easier, not needing to pick up glasses first thing in morning was a big big freedom. somehow it helped me become a better person. I won't say I'm completely free of social anxiety but with better confidence its easier to handle life.  \\n\\nToday I and everyone have forgotten that I ever wore glasses. I don't have any photo from my school life.  but every once in while I still think about the freedom lasik got me and I feel grateful for being able to see clearly.\\n\\nEnjoy the freedom and take care of your eyes.  Just when I thought of getting LASIK done, this AMA comes up. Good thing to be honest. I'm trying to get  Contoura Vision Eye Surgery which also is a type of LASIK. My question is how many days did the doctor advice you to not look directly at the sun or any bright objects? I mean how many days after you can return to your normal life style, job, using computer etc.? Opti-Lasik made you cool ..will hit on right girl for sure I am 17 with -7.2 vision. Reading this thread is a huge relief. Thank you. It's cool that the doctors changed ur dress and pumped some protein in u for no extra cost AMA? \\n\\nPM me your phone number.  Don’t mean to be rude but what’s the point of this? Why is their a advertisement in that washroom?\\nIs that your office or what?  Is their any risk? \\n\\nOn the side note, how did you manage to be so skinny?  How long has your prescription been stable? I think I have similar power and was looking at Lasik, did they inform you of the risks? If the surgery goes wrong, do you just go blind? Your top matches you bag/jacket or whatever it is you’re holding or it’s just a dirty mirror? :P Hey! my girlfriend is planning to get it done, I am a little bit concerned about it. Is there anything she must know about the procedure, apart from the usual that you can't be out for a month?  Is there a minimum power for which the surgery takes place? How old are you?what's minimum age requirement? Hi, how much time does it require to recover\\nI am planning for one, but will have work commitments  Which phone is that?  Can you also tell us what was your power last year and a year before last year? \\n\\nI wanted to get LASIK done to my eyes this year, my power was constant for last 2-3 years and just this year it decreased to -4.5 from -5. Doctor said to wait for one more year.  Total cost and recovery time? So, for how long you will be away from work??  I can't tell the difference in your eyes, though I do notice that you're wearing completely different clothing, different eye piece, changed hair style, are now wearing a backpack. What am I missing ? Is there any age limit/barrier to get this done? is it worth it?  I envy people who can get LASIK done. I’ve been waiting for a decade till I would turn 18 and when I did I was told that there’s risk that my retina might get detached again. Well I guess I’ll have to stick to contacts and specs for the rest of my life.  why Lasik why not SMILE eye surgery? I see most of your comments were 2 hours ago, so you'll probably not reply. Anyway. \\n\\nHow do you avoid eye strain post surgery, seeing as screens are everywhere and I'm assuming you didn't take a vacation or a 'tech cleanse'(?)...?\\n\\nAlso, what's the best place to get some parathas in Bangalore.? what was the cost of opreation?? You became a Badass!\\n Nice. Do you know if someone with higher order aberrations in their vision can get corrective surgery? Mine is -3 cyl left eye.. I was advised not to go for LASIK as my cyl power is high.. I am optimistic now looking at you . Someday! How much did it cost ? u/_hein_ ok i have some similar doubts, i also reside in Bangalore, do you have astigmatism on your left eye?, if so, is it in just one eye? \\n\\ni can see vertical double vision with just one eye closed on my right, meaning even if i close my left eye, it doesnt matter i can still see double, TEXT and right below it a shadow TEXT, i wanted to know if you also have the same problem and if did LASIK solve it, because i can't read properly as night arrives and can't read text on dark backgrounds, can't drive at nights as i can see everything twice from lights on street to vehicles that it gets annoying to drive at all at night.  So what are we suppose to do, look into her eyes? was the anesthesia  local or generalised? [deleted] Only one question. Why the AMA?  kiran rao? That neck though. Nobody fucking cares, go back to FB . \\n\\nAlso, where's the proof, all I see is a selfie attagirl. you look big on the right(!)\\n\\nI too had a LASIK 3 years back.

I had originally added this in the announcement post. \\n\\n>The national population register is a very old project whose pilot implementation dates back to 1986 in rural rajasthan. The project came into the mainstream after the kargil war of 1999 when India realised it can\\'t identify the foreigners from indians. During a conference of chief ministers on internal security in 2001, the project was approved. Part of the project every indian was supposed to be distributed Multi Purpose National Identity Cards, which were essentially smart card with fingerprints stored in chip. While this project was being piloted, India went through another attack on 26/11/08 in Mumbai by pakistani terrorists posing as fishermen. This is the first time cards were started being distributed to fishermen and so on.\\n\\n> But post 26/11, due to the heavy intelligence failures multiple other databases like NATGRID, CCTNS, CMS, Aadhaar poppped up. Aadhaar project and NPR were very similar. So to deal with it, the cabinet combined both of them, the registar general of india became a registrar under UIDAI and started distributing Aadhaar. The deal was NPR will get biometrics from UIDAI post de-duplication, but the supreme court stopped all of this by ordering no biometrics will be shared with anyone.\\n\\n>After all of this, NPR project continued and was updated part of 2011 census and again in 2015. The project in itself is the start of National Register of Citizens. NPR data will be used to disclose a list of citizens and the ones not in it will be classified as foreign residents. When data is being college for the npr, do people have to submit documents for verification? Let’s clear the elephant in the room. Is NPR as innocent as the government makes it sound? The Kerala and WB govt has stopped working on the NPR citing concerns that it will turn into NRC. Also does it actually take 8000crores to find this? What sorts of tools and software programs do you use for your research into NPR\\'s data sets? In your opinion, will this NPR/NRC project result in gerrymandering like it happens in the US where parties draw and redraw constituency to favor the chances of their party winning ? I have two questions. \\n\\n1) How do you think the govt should balance between privacy and security? Both seem to be opposite to each other. If the govt wants to grant it\\'s citizens some privacy (both online and offline), then that can pose a security threat as they won\\'t be able to identify terrorists. If the govt want to tighten up the security by monitoring data (online surveillance) and putting surveillance cameras everywhere (offline surveillance), then that becomes a privacy nightmare for a citizen of a democratic country. So how should the govt balance Privacy and Security of it\\'s citizens?\\n\\n2) Related to this, what do you think about Data Protection Bill recently brought into the Parliament? It feels like the govt is focussing more on the Security aspect than Privacy (in the context I explained above). The bill was supposed to give more Privacy to citizens but it feels like the bill has gone in the opposite direction. What are your thoughts on both these questions? Thanks a lot for doing this. My questions:\\n\\n1. While NPR is under citizenship act and Census under Census act, their data is being collected together. Can it be shared between the two? Is there a possibility of NPR data being used for delimitation given Census data\\'s privacy/anonymity clause? (as you hinted this this tweet) \\\\[ [https://twitter.com/digitaldutta/status/1209030276698931201](https://twitter.com/digitaldutta/status/1209030276698931201) \\\\]\\n2. How accurate are the EC\\'s \"voter list purification\" exercises? Do you know why do we have duplicates in voter list at all? Or is it just an excuse to delete voters who might not vote in favour?\\n3. Given BJP\\'s multiple lies and delays about NRC and rules to implement CAA, what do you think they really have in mind? How should the protesters go about it all? There are women in Shaheen bagh who are sitting outside for many days now. What should we aim to do here on and how do we do it? What if I refuse to give my data?? Hola! Any plans to anthologize the years of work you have put into this? \\n\\nAmazing work safeguarding knowledge. More people need to know about that too!\\n\\nAlso, your knowledge of the city -- Hyderabad -- is something you should share with us ;) How can this NPR data along with Aadhar can be used for winning elections as you pointed once in your thread? Is the NPR+NRC designed in a way that people are citizens by default, unless a sarkari babu handpicks individuals and families as they wish and issues a notice to them about their \"doubtfull\" citizenship status. This way, are the majority population not harassed by the NPR-NRC exercise ? \\n\\nAre we leaving this extremely delicate problem of deciding citizenship of an entire family under the hands of these random babus (which may or may not be employed by the BJP/RSS base to target specifically the muslims?). How do you ensure the data entered is legit? Since from what I read there is no furnishing of proof or any verification as such. what if I only provide 2 details- my aadhar detail and birth certificate and refuse to give pan/ voter/ passport/ DL? Hi Srinivas, thanks for doing it. You say that at this point Census and NPR are practically the same but I think their primary difference comes from the Act/Rules they come under. Isn\\'t it true that the Census data is supposed to be confidential and anonymized but the data collected under NPR (which is a broader set now anyway) can be tied to an individual and will also be made public (for NRC objections)? So is it true that NPR has no direct connection with NRC? In your article [https://thewire.in/tech/aadhaar-infra-npr-nrc](https://thewire.in/tech/aadhaar-infra-npr-nrc) you conclude that \"The government’s use of data to identify people and randomly create registries has created a multitude of problems.\\xa0 It is time they be put in check with the upcoming data protection bill.\\xa0\" Could you elaborate on what kinds of problems these are ? Also, i saw news reports which said that if you have given biometrics to UIDAI, you need not give them to npr. Then prakash javdekar said that no biometrics will be taken by npr. Does that mean uidai will give biometrics to npr? Isn\\'t that a violation of the aadhar act? In what ways is the npr different from the census? Trying to see this from the government\\'s point of view. What safeguards does it have that people will give accurate data if they are not compelled to give documents? I understand that the nrc will be culled from the npr after verification of documents. Isn\\'t this ridiculously inefficient? Why not verify at the npr stage itself? Hi S. K\\n\\nWhat do you see is the role of State level  govt databases - given many of them use an architecture based on Aadhaar seeding and link to NPR (at least on paper)?\\nDo you think there could be a issue of decentralised action from sympathetic State level agencies using such data even if NRC doesnt materialise \\'everywhere\\' from the Union govt? What do you think about all the issues raised in r/antiaadhar subreddit and privacy issues like [this revealing phone numbers and family info](https://twitter.com/fs0c131y/status/1023182584992473088?lang=en) bank info etc also gov saying aadhar not proof of citizenship as it can be made by any citizen for 500rs. How do NPR impacts NRIs / OCI card holders? What are you major, glaring concerns with Aadhaar, NPR and the fact that the government now has many many data points under each of our names? Is it realistic to fear misuse of this data by the government? Why Govt is having so many schemes and registers. Aadhar, NPR, NRC, why cant they have a single database which links all other documents like DL, Passport, Voter ID etc [deleted] Data collected under NPR will give a 360 degree view of the citizen. The government will have immense data about the citizen after this. The problems regarding surveillance with Aadhaar seem minuscule in front of this, as every possible data point is being collected. I am sure this data will be weaponized by the current regime, could you please list the various ways in which it will affect the people and why even parties who don\\'t yet stand against NRC will be affected by this? @digitaldutta my question is that would the NPR/NRC project render internationally accepted citizenship proofs like the passport. Would folks living on various VISAs in other countries need to come back to prove there citizenship.\\n\\nAlso, Birth Certificates are the easiest to forge as per my experience growing up and seeing it being done piecemeal. So, does it now become a race of \"I know a guy who knows a guy\" to get one\\'s citizenship in India? What will government do with so much data?? Is there any future plan or they just shooting arrows in dark?? Why is mandatory to furnish my aadhar, passport details to NPR. What can be the implications if I deny what ar the technical differences between Aadhar and NPR? From which month NPR is going to start? 1. Will the govt. verify the data provided? If yes, how.\\n\\n2. You have said that the govt. already has a lot of data about the citizens, can it not use that instead of NPR for preparation of NRC? What makes NPR so useful for the govt. for NRC?\\n\\n3. The key aspect for Citizenship is being born before 1987 currently, then lineage can be traced for further generations, how will the govt. verify the info. of the place and date of birth of our parents which is the key aspect? \\n\\n4. What about homeless beggars/ tribals, how will their info. be collected?\\n\\n5. You said that NPR began in 2001, did UPA also have the same intention to use it for NRC? is CAB the only thing that brings communal issue in it ?\\n\\n6. On what basis will they filter the NPR, for NRC lists?\\n\\n7. Besides, this is an upgrade exercise right, if our name is the 2011 and 2015 NPR, will it be removed if we dont provide info now?\\n\\nThanks in advance. What does it mean when they say that Aadhaar, passport and pan card is not a proof of citizenship?? How else are we to prove we are citizens? So with the upcoming Data Protection Bill, can the government snoop on the citizens private data like messages, emails, medical history etc. without court warrant? I\\'m your college batchmate and friend on Facebook. So excited seeing how you\\'ve evolved over the years! Hello sir ! Where I can read about aadhar in details...Like how it works, it\\'s effects on democracy, mass surveillance etc etc do you have blog, old articles on this,if so plz link ?

Also, back then I used to be enthusiastic at trying atleast lol. \\n\\nAt that day when the class finished, I walked behind her and said \\'excuse me\\'. Which she didn\\'t hear (or pretended to not to hear). I had to repeat and shout a little, when she stopped. She looked back and making an annoyed expression of what do you want. At this point, mera poora phat gaya tha. For couple of seconds, I didn\\'t know what to say. I stammered and said something like do you want to have coffee. She got so angry and threw her water bottle at me. I have no idea why she did that. Then she said, do you even know who I am etc etc and asked me to get lost. \\n\\nThat\\'s it. Next two days, I avoided my training classes (which were mandatory). Later, training finished and I never saw her again.\\n\\ncan share more, but my comments are not appearing. Did you ever take any steps to improve yourself to better sell yourself or put yourself out there? why didnt you do a quick bangkok trip? Dude, I feel for you. I\\'m just like you too. **M, 33, textbook virgin.** Never hand held any girl. Kissing a girl is in my bucket list. Have been too coward, poor and clueless to afford high class (safe) hooker. My parents have given up on me long ago and all my younger siblings are married now.  What\\'s the point of having an AMA if you don\\'t answer any of the questions?  I think you should get a dog for now. Who knows what the future might hold. Maybe the good boi could become your wingman. It\\'s ok dude. Marriage is not everything in your life. Save enough for your retirement and have emergency funds. Focus on increasing your networth and enjoy your bachelorhood.  Am posting this without reading any of the other comments. There\\'s two options you got:\\n\\n1. If you MUST, find someone who NOBODY else wants to marry. A nice human being who would appreciate you for who you are. A widow or a differently abled person. And you may find love. \\n2. Focus on your career and making, saving, and investing as much money as you can. And health of course. Then fuck bitches and whores (budget for it). \\n\\nThe second option is my recommendation. Relationships are overrated; dont get into one and for fucks sake dont make little people. Fuck that shit; live for yourself. \\n\\nBuilding great friendships is more satisfying and fulfilling than chasing shitty ass romantic relationships. \\n\\nAnd learn to rock that shit; not everybody is handsome and attractive... with the right attitude, you can make ugly awesome! I would rather have an ugly but awesome friend than hang out with a handsome looking asshole.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B; I think your parent\\'s social connection are weak, because there are many girls like you who desperately wants to marry someone and initiate normal family life, it\\'s that you don\\'t have reach to them (socially). The standard get rich/go to gym suggestions are silly. If that was the case more than half the men wouldn\\'t get laid. I suggest the following:\\n\\n1. This is also a failure of your social circle - your friends and family. Change who you hangout with. Make new friends. They have a responsibility to help you - remind them.\\n\\n2. Most of my relationships started in *activites*. Badminton, board games, book clubs, cooking lessons etc. Find some activities and slowly improve your social skills. Even if there are only guys, they have friends and sisters they\\'ll hook you up with.\\n\\n3. Change your location. I don\\'t know where you currently are but it\\'s clearly not your destined place. Move to Goa or Himachal or a big city or even a different part of your current city.\\n\\n [deleted] You can go for hookers but the STDs are scary though. Not to offend you  but\\n\\nWhat do you think is unattractive about you? Is it your physique, your expectations, or are you just ugly? (again, as a not so good looking guy I want to empathize your struggles and maybe share how you can improve)\\n\\nWhat specific actions did you take to become desirable? Like did you start hitting the gym, wearing good clothes, being confident etc. ?\\n\\nI\\'m 100% sure you can\\'t be that repulsive ( Unless you have a physical disability..still its not 100% impossible). I would say maybe your standards are too high? \\n\\nNot to be condescending, because I\\'m going down this road and I think we should try to change our lives for the better :) Have u hit the gym to look fitter? Have you clothed smartly to show nice personality? Have you given helping hand to someone in need? Have you tried being part of office parties?\\n\\nIf answer to all these is yes - sanyaas le lo, kuch nahi honewala.\\n\\nIf answer is no - your parents should\\'ve belted your ass. *When rejections started coming in, I gave up*\\n\\nWhy so many rejections? Have you objectively analysed? 1. (Are you) / (Were you ever) interested in finding someone? \\n\\n2. Did you ever like somebody and actually approached them?  I am afraid I am seeing myself in you. \\n\\nBut how do you hold up with your collegues? \\n\\nDo they also ignore/disrespect/avoid you?\\n\\nDo you feel dumb sometimes because of not being able to hold conversations? I like how so many people are suggesting trips to Amsterdam or Bangkok or sex workers as if OP asked for advice on how to get sex  This is pretty interesting to me, both academically and personally. My questions:\\n\\nWhat\\'s your current occupation?\\n\\nDid your parents look for a match \"below\" your status?\\n\\nHow is meeting all the relatives at weddings and parties like?\\n\\nHave you come to terms with being a virgin loner for until some more time, or maybe even forever?\\n\\nHow is your mental health? Any signs of depression? Self harm? Addictions? Suicidal tendencies?\\n\\nDo you smoke cigarettes? Drink regularly? Any hard drugs?\\n\\nWhat are your religious views? Do you follow any particular philosophy of life?\\n\\nI have a few more but would wait to see if you answer these. How are you now mentally? Did you have any kind of trauma growing up? Come friend, I will give you dosti wala lip kiss! How much porn do you watch? Never thought about hookers?  Are you happy? Have you found things in life that are fulfilling and meaningful? What are your hobbies? Remember you are a strong beautiful independent man that don\\'t need no woman except Kali Maa. Your worth is not tied to how attractive women may or may not find you. I hope you\\'re in a happy place emotionally speaking.  I mean unless you are physically deformed, I refuse to believe anyone is so ugly as to never get laid. A year of gymming, a decent haircut and some good clothes can go a long way [removed] In India, it is not at all a tough task to get married. All you need is money, are you well stuffed in that department ?  3 years till you become a Wizard. Me 10 years to go.\\n\\nIgnore above congrats you are Wizard Harry. Apparently you become a Wizard at 30 for bring sexless  Why not lower your standards? Unattractive females with similar awkwardness? My two cents. If you are looking to get married search for girls of age just touching 35 because the social pressure would be enormous plus the age number will also add to it. Have you tried looking for a divorce or widowed girl as well ?? Just my opinion being a 28 yo woman and reading your statements -\\n\\n• stop calling yourself unattractive. By saying this  have put yourself on a sort of lower scale & are probably treating others - especially people who YOU find good looking as better than you. \\nFact - they are not better\\n\\n• socially awkward - have you ever analysed why you feel this way. Do you get anxiety when you enter a group of people, Or when you walk into a new place with unfamiliar faces?\\nWork on your confidence, watch some YouTube videos. Improve on your self worth & self esteem.\\nAnd stop caring what others think about you.\\nIt doesn\\'t matter, how you view yourself matters.\\n\\n• coming back to your title -\\nSo you haven\\'t had a sexual experience. \\nIf you\\'re constantly thinking about that, it\\'ll make matters worse .\\nAnd if you really want some experience, go on tinder or start a friends with benefits with someone who is interested in you.\\nIn the end even the experience won\\'t help you get over the lonely feeling that one craves.\\n\\n• people who are genuine & want real relationships can judge a person by their vibe.\\nIf you\\'re kind, genuine, helpful & a warm open person, you\\'ll definately get really great women who would be interested in you.\\nBut you have to build a personality for that, & not use excuses like I\\'m socially awkward, haven\\'t had experience etc...\\nAll that can be worked on. & I\\'m sure you have some role models or celebs. Watch how those people behave & carry themselves.\\n& Please stop going on your looks, or on anyone else\\'s.\\n\\n\\nHope this helps & sorry if I crossed any line Ye pubG wala hai kya? Lol I know I\\'ll have the same faith. And guess what, I\\'ll enjoy every moment of it. Marriage is overrated anyway. Amsterdam jao. somvar ke vart rakh bhai ladki jarur milegi pakka vada hai mera. Indian women are becoming independent as years go by and don\\'t stay in marriages where the husband is an abuser or dowry problems, etc. So I think there are diorced women you can look out for or may be widows who lost their husband due to accident, etc.\\n\\nJust go through matrimonial ads in news papers, you will surely find some one, don\\'t give up, there is someone for you. Are you manglik? Women in India go for cash, not looks or personality.\\n\\nBut if you can\\'t afford a new car, you can always go for second hand. Look in the \"caste no bar\" section of the matrimonials. They have all the divorcées and widows listed there. As a bonus, they\\'ll be in your age range. And just to make you feel better, they usually have \"marriage not consummated\". Kind of like \"2 year old car, barely driven\". So even your parents won\\'t mind. Bruv atleast you can bang a nice hooker just for the heck of it, nothing wrong if you keep the mortality aside. Posting on reddit or whatsapp wont solve the problem trust me. Just go and bang a bitch even if you have to pay, we will feel more relaxed and you wont be a Virgin after that I don\\'t wish to karma-whore or hijack your Ama (though not really an ama if you do not reply, OP)\\n\\nI\\'m in the same boat, kinda. I\\'m 21m, and haven\\'t done those things either. My college is over, so I have no real way of meeting girls or anything now. Tinder really isn\\'t my scene(not saying this to be one of those \"I don\\'t think online dating is real\" people). Now I\\'m scared one day I\\'ll be posting something like this too. It really is a hollow feeling man, I can almost physically feel the pain in my chest. Hope it gets better for you though, OP. \\n\\nYes, I gym. No, I don\\'t party coz most of my close friends are studying to be CAs, so I won\\'t see them for the next 10 years. I work in my uncle\\'s delivery firm, so no real work friends either. [deleted] [you should see this](https://twitter.com/Joydas/status/1101694386767912967) Have you visited /r/FA30plus or /r/ForeverAlone?\\nI\\'m Indian American and in your boat, except 31 years old. After how many rejections did you give up ? Just curios. Were you not comfortable comprising at all? I have seen street bums getting married.  What were the reasons for rejections?\\n\\n What line of work are you in? What kind of music do you like?  Why no hookers? Seriously. Has this affected your work life? Future me, how often and in what manner is this aspect of your life bright up by your friends and collegues?\\n\\nAn entirely new set of connections could alter the odds towards favourable. Have you considered marrying women from a poor background? What about someone is lower caste? If you are that desperate to marry, you should be okay with that. Most of them who are in the low economic class would be happy to marry someone who earns 1lpm. If feel if you don\\'t don\\'t have high expectations, it\\'s not that hard to marry in India. Late here ... But I have a suggestion. If possible join a drama group or dance class even if you don\\'t meet a girl there ... You may find the activity enjoyable. Were you at any point in your life not interested in marriages or relationships? I want to confirm, coz i am now at that point and not sure whether i regret about this in future. If you are not finding a partner, lower your standards.\\n\\nHomeless, crippled, ugly as fuck  mofos find a wife. Why can\\'t you?\\n\\n But are you willing to lower  your standards? Is it worth it? Now that, is another matter. Bro try some divorced women market. You will get easily one.no point in growing old alone  Sorry Late to the AMA...so here is my question...\\nYou said you were tired of the rejection but how many eligible women did you reject?  You shouldn\\'t feel bad. I seriously don\\'t understand why marriages and relationships are hyped so much.. \\n\\nPlease have intercourse to break the assumption.\\n\\nEnjoy life to the fullest mate. Hey. Have you considered therapy and meditation? If you\\'re not happy with yourself, you can\\'t meet anyone. Confidence alone can get you places. \\n\\nHow many of the rejections you have hat are because of your mind bringing up past rejections? It is your mind that is sabotaging a lot of the times, since you can\\'t communicate with being frozen with fear and self conciousness. \\n\\nFind a good counsellor in your area (preferably Cognition Based Therapy). I know people whose lives have turned around because of that. Also, consider some form of meditation, or join Art of Living or some other meditation based support group.\\n\\nLet me emphasize this. It is important to fix what you feel is wrong with yourself. You have to realise the value of this life and not give up on making it better. Pm if you wanna talk. \\n\\nCheers :) \"I know how you feel\", because I\\'m just 4 years behind you. How does it feel to be not attractive? How does not being physically attractive affect the way you are treated in day to day life? What advice do you have for physically undesirable men? Dude there are many girls in there 30s who are also not getting married \\n\\nApparently the corporates are giving holiday to go look for brides and grooms  hmm interesting.  almost mid 30\\'s F here and single by choice. Unlike you I\\'ve had enough share of relationship and have ruthlessly dumbed quit a few for vivid reasons. One of them (as I go through your post) is self-pity. \\nSo my only one peace of advice would be to stop crying and self loathing, get your act together. \\n\\n\\nI honestly have never come across any smiling face that\\'s ugly. Rest sense of humor, confidence, positive aura, good physic  blah blah can always be worked upon only if you wish to put that extra effort on it. \\n\\n\\nTo end my point all I want to say is, no one likes to hear anyone\\'s  *randi rona*. \\n\\nGood Luck. \\n\\n\\n   What do you mean hug-less? Give yourself a hug ! Hug your parents :)  I would suggest you to get a hobby and a dog. Might help you to kill some time. 1) go to gym\\n\\n2) Find way to get rich. *Scrolls down the entire thread*\\n\\n... Please somebody tell this guy the meaning of AMA. Since you are a celibate anyway, you should spend some time at some ashram. That is the only good thing that can come out of this.  Are you using too much porn & musturbation from young age!!?
