*Sounds of ovaries bursting* I‚Äôve been told by women that they like it that I maintain strong eye contact. 

Didn‚Äôt know such a basic thing was so big for Indian women ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You'll have to first give us a list of all the things that a guy actually thinks himself to be doing in an unattractive way. pan stained teeth Subtly getting all girls usernames. 1. when they lend a hand when cooking, serving. (particularly when there is a group).

2. When they show emotions, like crying or admitting they are upset. In a weird way it is attractive. Maybe because of trust factor. 

3. When they share events from their life which they haven't shared with anyone else. 

4. When they speak and behave respectfully towards other women. (Because it is kinda rare tbh)

5. When they play with cats and dogs. Listening, not just hearing. Being attentive. Also rolled up sleeves. 1.6LPM pay stub works too.  /s Okay here goes. LONG list so be forewarned

1. Accidentally showing your tummy when you stretch- it's very attractive. Idk why. 
2. Dark circles- here's why; they show me you aren't vain about appearances, and that there's something you care about/enjoy enough to forgo sleep for. My ex used to have huge dark circles when he'd been studying all night, and I loved it.
3. Being scruffy- there's something very endearing about a guy who isn't super into appearances. Messy hair (not greasy though), comic book t-shirts, glasses- all cute.
4. Being tall and lanky- I LOVE this. I don't personally go for buff or built, lanky is my way forward
5. Rolled up sleeves- ten points added to attractiveness, immediately
6. When you know and explain things- not in a mansplainy way when when I'm not asking, but when it comes up and you genuinely know about the topic and can talk about it and help me understand. Knowledge, brains and being well informed is a huge turn on
7. Being well read- self explanatory
8. Playing with dogs! Feeding dogs! Taking care of dogs! Genuine affection for animals is always amazing to see. Melts my heart.
9. Being able to cook- weirdly very attractive 
10. Doing things with your hands- like fixing things, making things, whatever.
11. DRIVING. Don't even ask me why.
12. Leaning against doorframes, on walls, anywhere- I don't know why it's hot, but it is.
13. Being shy- somehow this is very endearing.
14. Treating people/the environment around you well- throwing your trash away where you should be, not the road. Being nice to waitresses. Holding doors open for people. All huge green flags.
15. Being a bit goofy- my best friend thinks he has a horrible voice, and NEVER sings when people can hear him. But a few weeks ago we were in sitting somewhere together listening to music, and he'd sort of forgotten I was around, and was singing to himself with air guitars when a Linkin park song was on, and it was SO cute. I'm a gay man but I'll chip in anyway because I couldn't participate in the previous post for straight men so here goes:

1. I'm really into guys who are street smart. Like guys who can bargain, travel alone, know where to score weed, get sweet ass deals online, game the system, file my taxes (someone help). That sort of thing. The sort of independence and self-reliance which so many women don't have. 
2. Curly hair
3. Guys who are comfortable with their body. Doesn't matter if you have a tummy or you're really thin. The confidence is hotter. 
4. Hairy chests and armpits. Yum. And a treasure trail. 
5. Clean dicks. No dick cheese üßÄ. This is VERY important. Please clean your dick every morning if you're not circumcised.
6. Being aloof and distant. So many guys will message you every day just because you sucked their dick once.  Wait for a couple of days, play it cool. and if I'm not replying, get the message. Neediness is such a turn-off. 1. Random acts of kindness. How he treats people under him, the waiter at the restaurant, kids, elderly and pets. Kindness would be the most important factor I look for in a relationship. 
2. Being shabby. There's something about men who seem clueless about grooming that makes my heart go aww. I would want to jump in and fix him, shower him with love and take care of him for the rest of my life. I love skinny boys with unkempt anime hair who walk around in nerdy graphic tees.
3. A boy who reads. The one who doesn't participate in show-off political debates in office (which are basically dick-measuring contests) because he knows better. 
4. Good taste in music. Plays guitar. I guess men already know that this makes them attractive.
5. Having a pet dog. 

I just realised that my bf already fullfills everything on this list. I feel so lucky to have found him xx", blackjourrnal BadAssKnight tardis_23 zpw6hgtmx3 internet_baba bhaagmodibhaag aurora1987 PM_ME_HAPPYSMILES peanutbutterasteroid bbigbrother agentpinksmith

Are men in India willing to date/marry a single mom?,126,cdtmh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdtmh6/are_men_in_india_willing_to_datemarry_a_single_mom/,160,1563289340.0,"I'm a single mom (29F) and would like to know if Indian men are willing to marry a single mom?

If you are someone who did marry a single mom, please share your story?",ILoveGuaco,AskIndia," If you're talking about marrying young unmarried men in their 20's, then no, it is frowned upon by the society. For older men above 40 then it's generally acceptable.

But as individuals I doubt anybody cares. From the perspective of a divorced, childless, middle-aged male, I'd date a single mother.

Marriage would depend on two factors - the degree of involvement of her previous partner with her children, and the rapport I can share with her children.

If the children are not happy to live with you even after multiple efforts from both persons, then the match isn't worth it. At the end blood always wins and the new partner gets alienated.

And if the bio-dad of the child is still actively involved with the child, then he becomes a ghost member of the family that you have to account for, often at inconvenient times. Planning a vacation during Diwali? Sorry, no. Bio-dad has already scheduled and got court sanction for a visitation during the same time. Even simple scheduled fortnightly or monthly visitations can become awkward.

If the two previous partners have had an acrimonious separation, then this can be especially problematic and stressful. Definitely not worth the trouble. Indian men : Surely.

Parents of Indian men : ummm.... Your question needs to be split up cause the case of dating and marry are different ball games. 

Dating : absolutely
Marry : there are going to be questions on the biological father and his present role. If the child and the person you date get along. etc etc

Its just that since there is another person who is as much a part of the relationship which might make the whole things slightly more complex, but its not a deal breaker Question is, is single mom willing to settle for me? If you're looking for unmarried men in their 20s then it's a maybe because even if the man is ready I'm doubtful his parents will be. Someone who is in same situation as yours will be more than ready. I'm in my mid 30s and while I have no qualms of dating or marrying a divorcee, I just dont want children in my life I've seen that happen thrice in my team in office. I remember my uncle marrying a single mom when I was a kid. My parents kept it a secret from me but I always knew. 

&#x200B;

He had to face a lot of issues and troubles. For a period, even I judged him at least mentally. But as I grew up I realized that we might fall in love with anyone anytime. So for me age, baggage, kids everything is secondary. Good luck ;) I've only dated a single mom (didn't work out), but a friend did marry one. He was older (almost 40) and hadn't found anyone as he a)wasn't interested, and b) kept shuttling between countries in his late 20s & early 30s. Met a divorced single mom who had a 6 year old daughter, hit it off, and they got married last year.

Both come from pretty liberal, forward-thinking families so I don't think you can generalise across our population. Chances of finding such men are higher in the larger, more cosmopolitan cities though.

Marry - depends on the nature of girl .", 77-q5 MurderOnDaIsle Gavthi_Batman rmenn PM_ME_HAPPYSMILES internet_baba Elonq sateeshsai strngerstruggle Dumma1729 SerialProcrastinater
"Its a well known fact that our media, in India, is very biased against dark skin. Dark skinned people are shown as ugly, or many times villainous, in most stories.",157,cdjn4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdjn4c/its_a_well_known_fact_that_our_media_in_india_is/,90,1563237034.0,"People of India are relatively dark skinned people. 

And we hate dark skin. That means we love to indulge in self-hate. This distorts our self perception, and affects us in so many different ways I cannot enumerate in a single post. I have seen people act distant from their 2 year old child because the kid was somewhat darker. That's just an example, and not to say that every parent hates their dark skinned kid. But almost every parent DOES wish they had a fair skinned kid. All such factors and others combine to create my opinion that prejudice against dark skin is a form of self hate, and we need to change it.


I have three questions in a bid to provoke answers and thought:

1. Do you think dark skin should not be stigmatized in media and life, and what do you think we can do about it?

2. Do you have suggestions of names of dark skinned beauties, whether male or female, especially those from India. Right now I can't seem to come up with beautiful dark skinned people in India, because our media and movies diabolically only promote fairer skin people. 

3. What do you think we can do to promote the idea that dark does not mean ugly? 

It is not just the media that is biased: people themselves are hugely biased against dark skin. Its tragic, sad and has very negative consequences for all of us. 

That is why I want to promote the idea that dark skin is beautiful too. Everyone MUST know that it is possible to be beautiful and dark.",DarkBeautifulSkin,AskIndia," Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone used to be darker/brown than they are now.

I think I saw last year, some new channel were saying they decided to not air fairness ads ever again.

We need to call out these fashion magazines, they always whitewash the stars for their shoots. Outside of India, the fashion industry is using all types of people.

Bollywood is a great platform but nobody is bold enough to go out and do that I guess for fear of losing out on money, endorsements and that. Sometimes I think this whole white skin thing is so much ingrained in peoples heads that they won't accept a dark-skinned normal guy or girl as a hero/ heroine you know, some sort of a catch 22 situation. In my 28years of life. Every fucking day someone or the other called me a kaalu or a kaalia.
Killed my confidence every time.
Till last day of my college i was not 'scholar' for getting good marks. Not 'coder' for writing programmes. Was never a 'builder' for gyming.
Was never a 'bhai' to be their bro. I was always kaalu.
Sounded like a dog.
People never stop. Trust me.
In school i had a different set of friends. They came up with this name. In jr.college same thing. In grad and in post grad. Same fucking thing.


Until i had a company. People were decent. It was a good conversation with well educated well mannered people.
Until it wasn't.
In other groups or behind my back, they still called me a kaalu üòÖ

Aunts and uncles joking things like "" mom didn't gave you a good bath when you were a child"".

""Why are you taking a bath, its not like something is gonna change your color""

Got rejected coz of the complection. A crush of mine said it on my face, ""tere se shadi karegi tog apne bacche zebra paida honge""

A friend i met after 10 years, the first thing he said is ke ""aare tu toh aur kala hogaya re""
Like fuck seriously? Haven't i become more successful? More mature? More interesting? All you noticed is my colour?

I remembered my 22 bday. Peak of haramipanti.
When we use to collaborate and give gifts to all our group friends who had bdays. All useless gifts. 
Like one was a fuckboy. We gifted him honeymoon pack condom box. 
One use to be always sick, we gifted him a box of cough syrup.
Then came my bday.
They gave me fair and lovely.

I decided to live like this.
This is my life! I find south indian film industry much worse than bollywood in this regard especially in casting females in lead role. Look at how many actresses get break there only because they have fair skin. us Indians are so in head over heels about the white skin thing sometimes makes me wonder if we have some kind of Stockholm Syndrome situation with the Brits leaving us in 1947 I have a small thing to share . So i actually thought a woman(who was dark skinned - Not something i noticed) was really beautiful and i told her that . She refused to believe it , added that she knows she is dark and accepted the fact.. blah blah.. blah..  She is a good friend of mine and I still haven't established the fact that i actually thought she is beautiful and not some random flirt statement . I just want to answer this as systematically as I can. 

1.  **Do you think dark skin should not be stigmatized in media and life, and what do you think we can do about it?** 

Definitely dark skin shouldn't be stigmatized. The first thing we can do is to stop buying any products that have ""skin-lightening"" in the uses. No Fair and Lovely, no skin-lightening face washes, BB creams, no skin bleaching (avoid this like a disease, because bleaching your skin is *insane*). Stop giving money to an industry that feeds off of peoples' insecurities and society's worst aspects. That's the simplest thing for us to do.

I think a lot of it is not in the hands of consumers, but in the hands of creators. Writers, Youtubers, musicians, artists, photographers, anyone involved in creative pursuits. In America, movies like *Get Out, Black Panther* and *Us* showed that movies with male leads that were black could make money. Especially *Us*, because the movie could've been cast with a white family but the director chose not to.

Even in Bahubali, the main actor Prabhas is not 'fair' by Bollywood standards. Anushka Shetty, the actress playing 'Devasena' is not the color of snow. She's not exactly dark-skinned, but it's a starting point. He could've cast one of the whiter actresses, but he chose not to. Even in schools, we see teachers choosing the fairer people to be ushers during ceremonies, to play lead roles in school plays, and this attitude of fair=better is propagated by people in power. 

We should encourage dark-skinned Indian creators on Youtube. Indian singers on Youtube should be judged based on their talent and not their skin tone (here's looking at you, Shirley Setia). I just found out about this Indian musician called Ritviz. Check him out, his music is amazing. 

**2. Do you have suggestions of names of dark skinned beauties, whether male or female, especially those from India. Right now I can't seem to come up with beautiful dark skinned people in India, because our media and movies diabolically only promote fairer skin people.** 

Try South Indian industries. We do have some dark-skinned or brown actresses. I'm just gonna list without linking to them because I do have a pretty long list of them:

* Aishwarya Rajesh
* Sneha (a tamil actress)
* Nithya Menen
* [Bhanupriya](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ae/b0/e5/aeb0e5a1894f12d9cebb3ddf562e1482.jpg)
* Rekha (Umrao Jaan, that Rekha)
* Shraddha Srinath
* Shalini Pandey
* Amala Paul
* Anjali (a Tamil and Telugu actress)
* Nivin Pauly
* Vijay Devarakonda 
* Siddharth (the guy from Rang De Basanti)
* Nani (the guy from Rajamouli's Eega, he's amazing)
* Dhanush (of Rowdy Baby and Kolaveri Di fame)
* Padmalaxmi ( an American model of Indian origin)
* Sendhil Ramamurthy
* Smitha (the actress that the Dirty Picture was based on)
* Suriya (Tamil actor)

There are a lot of actors that were naturally of a darker skin tone that became progressively fairer as they became more famous. Perhaps due to demands from the industry. I know that the majority of these people aren't dark-dark. But a lot of them, if you look at their older work, had a much darker skin-tone than now. Idk, I tried. 

3.  **What do you think we can do to promote the idea that dark does not mean ugly?** 

The first thing and the best thing is to change our perspective. As a kid, we've all been fed this false narrative that fair=beautiful and that dark skin is something to be avoided. When you start searching for beauty among dark-skinned faces, you find it more often than not. Because beauty is more about symmetry, about proportions, than it is about color.

Looking at faces like Naomi Campbell's, you can see that it's very easy to be dark and beautiful. Her face structure is just out of this world. We have to de-condition ourselves and the people around us from the fairness brainwashing we've all undergone. I remember seeing this one woman on the road. She was probably just a daily wage worker or something of the sort. Her skin was dark, and her face was ridiculously symmetrical and she had these amazing aquamarine eyes. In another world (or at least in another country), she could have easily been a waif model. I seemed to be the only one that noticed that. My friends next to me saw her skin and nothing else. Her unique eyes didn't matter, her bone structure didn't matter. I think it takes time to let go of the unconscious prejudice. 

We should stop saying, ""If only they were a bit fairer."" and start appreciating how beautiful brown skin can be. Whole indian society is biased 
What are u talking about?
Also the word you're looking for is racist Colonial legacy. The British may have left but the damage left a deep scar within the society. 

The only way to fix this is for India(and Asia) to decidedly shift back the power pole towards the East. As long as the highest grossing movies and most watched TV series in India or Asia are Hollywood produced with white leads, worshipping of Caucasian beauty standards will continue. 

Didn't one of India's most popular actress married a white male recently? Imagine what message that is sending to Indian women. I think it'd be better to teach in schools that it is natural to have dark skin especially if you're closer to tropics and equator. There's a brown girls gazing page on Insta, I love the girls there. Yesterday, during the Eng-NZ match, they were showing an ad for Durex Mutual Climax condom. The ad's central characters were a white caucasian guy and a brown skinned Indian girl. The girl was extremely beautiful and her expressions were absolutely spot on. That's what we need. More representation of brown skinned actresses in popular media, that actually shows how beautiful they can be. Only then can we hope to eradicate this white-skin worshipping mentality of our society. Bollywood needs to play the central role in furthering this cause.", aurvvana sardikhasi bunnykumarxyz samosa_pav Gold_comment SkepticWriter arp5648 kshatriiya SocioliberalBuddha RaevanBlackfyre Saaamwise

Dust it off and turn a new leaf. Hold on buddy. It's going to get worse. To be fair it depends on school. My school was icse too and fairly modern and disciplined. Everyone was upper class. But outside school and school friends life was opposite. 
As myschool expanded it brought rural rich kids and shit teachers.
Icse syllabus is very well rounded. Even average student is quite high in vocabulary and general knowledge. Icse student generally are more upper class in personality, well spoken, knowledgeable and not strictly 'wrata bazi' with no passion. 

But it doesnt matter because everyone care about percentage of 12th and nothing else.
 
I did kg to 10th in icse  and 11 to 12th in cbse stark difference. Although school reputation matters most icse on avg is better. 

But remember only % matters. What efforts did you put in? No one can be ""settled"" in life - even at 70 years old people are still struggling. In fact life gets worse the older you get. If you went to a good college and speak decent english, you have a head start and can at least get a foot in the door in terms of a job. But maintaining that position at the job is a whole different story. For that you need soft skills. Technical skills can go f*ck themselves because most of the tech stuff will eventually be done by robots. What you need are soft skills. Just work on those and you'll be fine. Dude, ISC / ICSE board sure is helping me in the college as I'm way ahead in computers ( Data Struc, OOPs, General Programming, Algorithms etc.) cause they teach programming from the 9th class onward ( Java ) and my teacher was excellent too Passion is a latin term which means 'suffer', to be passionate is to suffer, the day you stop suffering for your gains the day you stop growing in life.

"Question for Indians: would you say that the Indian work ethic is similar to the Japanese, where ""appearing to work"" is more important than productivity level?",135,ce5rgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ce5rgh/question_for_indians_would_you_say_that_the/,77,1563353513.0,"In Japanese salaryman culture, it's common for workers to spend work hours being unproductive, or even having nothing to do until their boss gives them work. The culture surrounding work emphasizes *being at work* and *appearing to work*, but actual level of productivity is less important. It's more important that your butt is in the chair for 10 hours a day than that you're productive. This is why despite the long hours, [Japan has a very low level of productivity](https://www.tokyoreview.net/2018/07/japan-productivity-overwork/):

>The problem is that for Japan, productivity isn‚Äôt the point. The professional culture is input-based (full schedules of meetings, onerous paperwork and menial tasks, and similar) rather than output-based, where long hours and late nights are a less a means to accomplish tasks and more of a means of value-signaling, demonstrating devotion to the organization and commitment to the team members. That isn‚Äôt unique to Japan ‚Äì any visitor to Washington, DC will notice people boasting of their lifespan-shortening work regimens ‚Äì but what‚Äôs unique to Japan is prioritizing the effort made over concrete results. There are two reasons why the problem is so pernicious.

I was wondering if this work culture would also apply to India. I know very little about Indian work culture. Does it similarly emphasize appearance and the ""ritual"" of work, over raw productivity?",penpractice,AskIndia," From my corporate experience more than a decade back, I found Indians highly emphasize appearance. Back then it was preferable to not look like you're loafing around if you have free time at hands and gather more work, help a colleague on a project, etc. But this made employees more strategic about when to finish work they already have. So if a project can be finished by 3 pm, but you leave office at 6 pm, it's better to slow down the work and pretend you're working and submit the files to your team leader/HoD 10 minutes before 6 pm. And if the next day are Saturday and Sunday, it becomes even wiser to do that. Or else you HoD/TL might give a call on Saturday to come and work on the new project citing ""urgency"". Indian managers, in my experience were heavily exploitative and the common sense attitude of ""I have finished my work and therefore can go home"" doesn't work when their reply is, ""you may have finished work, but there is other work to do. Be conscientious and selfless. Look how hard your colleagues are working."" The fact that the employee was conscientious and finished his work on time was overlooked. 

Such attitude from managers doesn't allow employees to have peace of mind, and they are always thinking tactically because they learn their sincerity counts for nothing. And once this attitude of working slow and pretending spreads like fungus in the work culture, anyone fresh and dynamic with positive thoughts and ideas is pulled down (deliberately, or passively) by others, till the new comer becomes stale like the rest of them. This is something you see a lot in government offices except in corporate cultures, the payment is better, and work conditions are superior. But the mentality to some extent is the same. Or at least was.   

I don't know how much it has changed in the current work force. I no longer work in corporations. Nowadays, they of course have smart phones and social media apps and whatnot, so I expect everyone to be more ""happy"" even if they are working on Sundays but I actually don't know. This is one similarity between Indian and Japanese work cultures. The other is low wages and exploitation. Generally speaking, yes.  
But 10-5 in govt. jobs and 9-6 in private jobs. And people don't serve the full time in that either. Sadly major firms follow the same work ethic. But, there are few firms which are trying to change this culture and trying to make happy culture for people working there. For instance I can speak for the firm where I am working. We don't have strict rules regarding in-time and out-time. People are allowed to work from home indefinitely unless some work requires you to be present in the office. I realized that this happy culture is much more productive compared to the strict policy of 9-5.
The work culture is so good that the director of the firm was even called on TedX to speak about ""Building a happy workplace"" Despite salary man culture, Japanese productivity per citizen is miles higher than Indian productivity per citizen. Don‚Äôt know about the Japanese but our factory called Chinese engineers for a machine installation and they were surprised by how many breaks people here took and how little they worked. 

Even though the Chinese were on our paid food and stay, they worked 10+ hours intensely to get it done asap. Expend minimum effort required for the acceptable amount of work done is the government employee motto. As a freelancer, I realize that you actually need about 5 hours of productive work in a day to be really productive I know a guy who works for 18 hours and screws everything and yet countless people worship him for his hardwork... Add Korea to the list (and probably China, too). I hate to say this, but I feel like some people don't even care about whether they appear to work hard or not. They simply don't bother doing either. And then they come in and collect a pay check and go home. For us, it's less about appearing to work hard, and more about appearing as if we are successful. Which is quite easy to fake, if you have the means. 

Besides, the Japanese have something that I feel the Indians often don't have as a collective, and that is a culture of diligence. The Japanese are committed to doing a good job, and they're often not hemmed in by a bureaucracy that punishes them for trying to do that, which can't be said for India, where even the people who want to do their work with a certain type of standard are held back by people who simply don't want to bother. Which is a real shame, because there are some really committed, judicious people out there, who in any other environment could do a lot of good. This doesn't mean Japan doesn't see its fair share of corruption and negligence, of course it does. And of course, they also have a high premium on appearances, which means that there are always people who would rather appear to be diligent rather than actually be diligent in their work.

But here's my number, so marry me baby Take you owns time. Nobody can dictate terms. Takes years for a relationship to mature. Better go slow and if she still pressurises, break up and never look back. Needless to say, till you clearly makeup your mind, don't have sex with her no matter what! Sex in pretext of false promise of marriage is a criminal offense.

I belive 21 is way too young to get married or even think about it. Your life might change with your future job or further education and so will preference for a life partner. Don't commit this early. I foresee a Rape FIR due to false marriage promises Never put your dick in crazy Run like the wind. Run Forrest! Run! Run Personal experience - Girls ask for commitment untill you get way to serious about them , then they'll kick you in the balls and leave you . 
 
What's right - tell her that committing at 21 will be really premature , you should see where the relationship takes you in due course of time.

It will definitely be a massive capital cost but have the benefit of generating employment and industry for a large part of the rural belt as well as try to reduce the impact of future droughts as Afforestation is believed to massively reduce the impacts of droughts when they do occur.   


An example of a state that needs it sorely for example is Maharashtra which should ideally have 33% forest cover but currently only has 8%  


Would love to know why it isn't possible and if the current schemes that are there should be super powered and put up as something to be done on a war footing.",stuli1989,AskIndia," Massive illegal sand mining from rivers has rendered irreparable damage to water systems. Governments turned a blind eye to this. Working on rainwater harvesting and afforestation does not get the politicians more votes. direct transfer on money to farmers and loan waivers do help. 

The problem is that politicians are short-sighted and often blinded because of electoral politics. Farmers will not rely on direct transfer or loan waivers if they are provided facilities like assured irrigation, MSP, access to better technology and marketplaces. etc. they can earn for themselves and be self-sufficient. 

In India farming is still largely dependent on rains. even after 70+ years of independence there has been little work to improve the situation in those aspects. But I again have very little hope even this (or any future) government. [deleted] What's in it for the government...during it's term? Let me explain with an example- 

In 2014, when children in Bihar died of the same thing they are dying now, the union health minister announced multiple virology labs, speciality hospitals and institutes, research centres and upgradation of hospitals to deal with everything. 

It's 2019. Zero. Literally zero progress has been made. And the union health minister announced same things again this year. 

The finance minister in his budget 2015 announced that a new AIIMS will be built in Bihar. It's 2019 and the Bihar government were to identify 3-4 options for land for construction of AIIMS and in 4 years the government hasn't even identified the land for it. Insert the meme ""*We don't do that here*"" Can't do it. We have to stop illegal lingerie mannequins first The roadblock in doing that is that nobody makes a short-term monetary or electoral gain by doing that.

Tragedy of the commons. Tragedy of capitalism. >Implying Indian politicians are interested in something that will require long term planning and still doesn't guarantee them money or votes in next election.

Welcome to the Coaching Business Industry When i got 99.5 percentile in sectionals in CAT a very prominent CAT coaching Institute put up my photo on their roadside banners in Pune. I had only taken one free 'National mock' test they had conducted. 
When I confronted them I was offered an apology and 5k. It says ""distance course"". so, probably Aakash gave him some incentives for this claim or he actually took their long distance course. Although I don't deny that coaching classes approach many top rankers after the results, I know that there are students who willingly associate with multiple coaching institutes. 

Some take DLP of one(Akash, mostly) and do classroom of other, thereby extracting the best of both 

Other scenario is when a  student does initial part of his coaching in one institute and then for various reasons switches to another.
Reasons include : unsatisfactory teaching at current Coaching, fear of grass being greener on the other side, doing foundation here (coz foundation faculty is good here) and 11-12th elsewhere.
In all such scenarios, both institutes have rights to publicise them as Classroom students.

Been there, done that. How does AIR 5 have classroom courses on both the institutes? Different shifts?

I know how a student takes one classroom course and multiple distance learning ones to make appearances on multiple coaching institutes, but is this some type of fuckup? #common question every year paison ka chakkar babu bhaiya Coachings doing scams?

Two of the poorest person in my mum's family got super rich very quickly, no one knows how! Both are brothers. The day my mother gave birth to me, my mousi(maternal aunt) gave birth to her daughter(my cousin). 
We are just a few hours apart. I got to know later on that my Nanaji proposed to swap the babies that night so that my parents had a daughter(they wished) and mousi gets a son(she probably wished for). My Nani fought about it and didn't let it happen. My mother committed suicide when I was 6 months old, my mother's parents family thinks my father's family poisoned her as no woman will commit suicide when she has 6 months old child in her lap. I lived with my mother's parents till 18, they always blamed my father as a characterless man. Uncle was a builder who was on the up n up, got a new contract for a huge building project, didnt do proper testing of soil or smthng building collapsed and killed about 20 labourers with it. Uncle absconded for about a month, then was finally caught...spent a month in jail where he met charles sobhraj and apparently became friends(?)...he was cleared though and we had to hire top lawyers to defend him but i guess hes doing fine now, no more big buildings but he got his license back. I'm not going to talk about previous generations who are dead because I don't know if they're even true or not. My family is not the most educated, I believe my generation is the first one to get top quality education. 

My maternal uncle has a mistress who's a widow or divorcee, and she has been disowned by her family. Everyone in the mohalla knows about it. She was his old first love but they couldn't get married because of she was of lower caste. Somehow and I don't support it, my aunt has reached some settlement where they remain married but they have no emotional connection. My uncle is at this moment in Delhi for the admission of his mistress's daughter in a college. People even think she's his daughter, but I don't think so.

My maternal cousin sister is in affair with a guy. They're court married, or they claim to be, but he doesn't take her home because his parents don't agree since they're of a higher caste. I absolutely think the guy is a bastard who doesn't care about her and is only playing her, and that they aren't married, it's just rumors for my mother's side of the family.

My SIL's father has two wives, both sisters and they all live together. The older one whom he first married was unable to bear children and so he married her sister, and somehow they live happily, or at least with no major issues.

In my village, one of my distant older cousin was gay or something. I think he was a transgender, no one talks about him. Was,  because he committed suicide. There are rumors that he was murdered by his family because of fear of humiliation. I don't know what actually happened.

So, conclusion, my (extended) family is really fucked up, we have a history of infidelity, depression and suicide. There are so many stories like these. My family is probably the sanest and most normal one here. [deleted] My aunt(father's sister) got married at 11 and her husband was around 16-17. She became a mom by 18 and a grandmother by 34!

Her son i.e my cousin was married at 13, and had a son by 16. The bride was much older than him. Fourteen years later, she committed suicide.

No one knows why she did it. Our family faced severe hardships few decades ago, so we came up with a stage act and hoped it would bring us some fortune.

We tried to pitch it across several talent management entities with some success but it was considered very controversial by many.

We have decided to come up with a new act but its still a work in progress One of the smugglers in my mother's village who used to be hiding from the police in one of my mother's relatives house became right hand of MGR(late TN's CM) and he even build a University with land donated by MGR.

Water is a basic resource and it might lead to people doing crazy shit for just water, which many of us waste. Pollution is increasing - air, water, noise, land.

&#x200B;

Opinions are welcomed.",kernelslayer,AskIndia," There's two ways to address your question/rant/whatever: a point-by-point refutation, and a big picture refutation. Let me try a bit of both.

Big picture: you need to understand our history to fully understand the scale of crises we've already dealt with. Separatist violence - Kashmir, Punjab, North East, Naxalism, Maoism, severe (real) food shortage - we used to depend on imported foodgrains before the green revolution made us self-sufficient, immense ignorance and illiteracy - we had 15% literacy in 1940s, and a paper-thin govt. Even as late as 2000s, we had endemic power shortage leading to long cuts even in summers. These problems were solved and now the country is self-sufficient in power generation, and most power sector issues are DISCOM-specific (economically).

Now we're a 3T economy, with 75% literacy rate, 600 billion dollars available for the central and state govts. to spend in tax revenue, a growing economy - exact rate of which is disputed but 5-6% is a number we can agree on.

Half the issues you raised are trivial/moot.

> The rate at which water is wasted

To an extent fixable, as our local bodies get their shit together. When on the brink of crisis, people find ways to solve problems. The tanker mafia crisis in metros is actually a boon because it provides economic incentives for conservation - people are installing unit-level IoT water meters in apartment buildings, recycling for flushing etc. and so on.

> The food might run out due to the surge in population

Balderdash. Our food production issues were solved during Green Revolution. No country with a GDP/capita of $2000 and growing is starving, and is rich enough to import foodgrains if a massive catastrophe impacts production temporarily for a couple of years. For every suicide you see in papers, there are 10 farmers making a living, not a luxurious living - sure, but can feed themselves and their families.

The surge in population bit is BS. Our population growth is slowing down, TFR is down to 2.3 which is very close to the replacement rate. If you can feed 1.3B today, you can handle 1.33B the next year and so on. At 1.6B or so our population will stabilize, and we'll finally be at a stage where the number of people is not outstripping the amount of roads/railways we build.

Worldwide, there's a glut of agricultural produce.

> Air pollution due to unchecked emissions

Every country goes through a phase of unchecked industrial growth, which is contained as those issues hit crisis levels. If you go back a hundred years you'll read similar stories about Thames or Sienne.

> Religious, racial and political issues

We had bigger religious/political/racial issues 50 years back, and law enforcement was poorer, and people were less educated. A handful of cases in backward districts are blown up by the 24x7 media.

The average Hindu might not be a fan of the average Muslim, but he has no problems buying goods or services from him. It leads to gentrification, but not religious violence.

> Tremendously increasing pressure on metro cities

Yes, our economic growth is very unequally distributed. You can leave your 20LPA job in Bangalore and get 5 offers in a week, but in a tier-3 town you'd be hard pressed to find a 3LPA job. To an extent cities like Pune and Hyderabad are taking off, but it's still too less.

> Government and government employees being their worst at their jobs.

Unkill-ish hand-waving. There are plenty of problems with govt, but they are also facing ever-increasing scrutiny, with public pressure to create complaint handling mechanisms, and expectations of time-bound handling of complaints. The situation is far better with central govt. employees, and state govts. could do a lot better.

-------------

TL;DR is that yes, we'll face hetherto unforeseen livability challenges over the next 15 years. In this time frame, we'll also start transitioning to a clean energy economy, planned urban spaces, stronger pollution enforcement and so on. All problems are solvable as you become richer, and there's no indication that we won't continue on the path of economic growth - we might slip to 5% from 9%, but the growth engine will keep on chugging along.

Edit: thank you, kind anon, for the gold :)

Edit 2: interesting quote I found from Norman Borlaug's wiki:

_Biologist Paul R. Ehrlich wrote in his 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb, ""The battle to feed all of humanity is over ... In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now."" Ehrlich said, ""I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971,"" and ""India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980.""_ it already sucks. takes me 45 mins to cover mere 5 kms. huge waste of time and fuel. Liveable if you got ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ. I would like to remind people that India has gone through pretty shitty times during the last couple of centuries. Just go through the major catastrophes that befell us. Famines, the world wars, the partition massacres, crushing poverty, widespread riots, wars with neighbors, violent secession movements, etc.

It's true, this time too it's going to be difficult. These threats that you outline might unravel our society.

But then again, they might not. I have faith in the fundamental goodness of the country and its people. These threats might well cause us to rise above our narrow differences and bond together as fellow humans. I saw a hint of this during the last floods in Kerala, when people came together to help each other. I am sure that a common enemy will force us to rediscover our shared humanity once again. Paili fursat me nikalna h I have strong opinions on climate change, so please bear with me.

I think climate change is going to disrupt everything in the next decade. Every week, there is some news about it. We read it, feel helpless and move on with our lives. Then turn around and blame it on the politicians and others. Sometimes we also act and make small changes in our lifestyle; stop using plastic bags, save water, etc.

However, nobody really knows what's in store for us. We get warnings every other week. This is the hottest month, the civilization is ending in 2050, the insects all dying, the corals being bleached, food chain is collapsing, etc. At some point, you just stop paying attention. What can we do, after all. These problems are so big and intractable, right?

Wrong. We can do something; [plant trees](https://www.livescience.com/65880-planting-trees-fights-climate-change.html). Trees are the only way we can save our planet. We all fondly remember our childhood and trees played a central role in it. I used to climb up the trees in my backyard and pluck the fruits. I haven't done that in decades. Where has our love for trees gone?

We need to rediscover our love for trees. Only then can we save the planet. I just need some way to get out of here. I'll become a taxi driver if that's what it takes. Yes, it may not seem like it but things are actually getting better. 

On the water front, our home in Bangalore had a borewell (just like everyone else), but with the adoption of rainwater harvesting and the arrival of Kaveri water, we use the borewell a lot less than before. We've noticed that the water table level has risen. As more people adopt these measures, the water shortage will improve.

On the traffic front, more public transport (like Metro) is being adopted in more cities. (Unbelievably, Lucknow has a metro now!) Overall, this will take years (maybe decades) to build out but it will definitely resolve some of the traffic issues.

Also, with good metro, high-speed rail etc. in combination with village electrification and running water, the pressure to move to cities like Bangalore will reduce. And then as seccond and third tier cities like Mysore or Mandya being to acquire modern amenities, some businesses will relocate there further reducing the pressure on the big cities.

Also, there was a research paper studying the impact of global warming on the Indian monsoon which found that it is going to result in the subcontinent getting 10% more rain. (If you're surprised by this, don't be. Warmer air can hold more moisture in it and the south west monsoon gets its moisture from the Indian Ocean, which is not going to run out of water.) This is a huge amount of extra water which will actually be good for our country. Of course, the possibility of floods and cyclones increases with global warming, but as last year's cyclone Foni showed, these are manageable problems if competent people are in charge.

Now, all this will take decades to have an impact on your immediate situation, but in the long run, we are on the right path. The most immediate problem is the water, while others will not make India uninhabitable in the short term. The government needs to sort out the water crisis. Some of the responses above highlighted most of the key issues. I work as a researcher and practitioner in the area of urbanisation, specifically in the areas of mobility, water and sanitation and governance. My reply therefore might not add any value or could be  terribly narrow and blinkered, so do bear with me. 

Indian cities, like those in other parts of the developing world, are exploding in terms of their population growth. Urbanisation at this rate is unprecedented in human history, so even though we might know potential solutions, the scale that we need to cover is mindboggling.

Unfortunately, our governments do not have the financial or human resources to structure and order this process. Therefore, while we have good policies and legislations for the most part, governments are not in a position to enforce them. Take the case of water supply in Bangalore. Pumping water from a distance of 100 kms and an elevation of 300 metres, BWSSB manages a world class system in bringing water to the doorsteps of Bangalore, spending tens of thousands of crores.  However, once it reaches the city, the horrible distribution network within the city means that lakhs of households are not connected to this network. The old pipelines also cause leakage and leads to 45% of this water to be considered as 'wasted'. Fixing the whole network would costs hundreds of thousands of crores, if we had the capacity to do it. So we don't. For politicians, they've managed to bring water for residents, so they continue to get elected. For bureaucrats, they've acheieved the same, so they continue to work in the same manner, pushing for low-hanging fruits rather than engage in structural reform. 

We citizens also contribute significantly to it, ignoring and avoiding any roadblocks that reduces our comfort. We flout building norms, traffic rules and labor laws because we know the state doesn't have the capacity to enforce the law. So whoever can afford to, digs borewells to ensure that they have a coping mechanism. However, even after knowing of water scarcity, we don't change our lifestyles to adapt to these new conditions. We still want to wash our cars daily or leave the shower running because it suits us. We don't want to install rainwater harvesting systems because we don't want to spend money. 

Right now, society as a whole is continuing on its business as usual path. The problem is that resources are running out and climate change will exacerbate all of our existing problems. Water is going to be undoubtedly the largest. Some studies have pointed out that by 2025, Bangalore would be unlivable due to the lack of water. The situation is pretty much the same in most other parts of the country as a casual scan of the news for the past 3-4 months should confirm. 

Can this be reversed? Possibly. But we don't seem to want to do it. As time goes on, it becomes more and more harder and expensive to get there as well. Unfortunately, given the humungous inequality in our society, it means that the privileged will be able to access technology and government support to continue in the same fashion. The poor will suffer. We as a country are just managing to improve upon our modest baseline in making the lives of the citizen better, climate change will definitely push it back down. Life expectancy and incomes will reduce for the poor, while expenses for healthcare will drastically increase. 

When people's lives are not getting any better, social divisions tend to widen. Violence as a whole might increase, especially in areas with little policing along the lines of gender, religion, region, caste and class. However, this is something that the State and the political class like to manage/control, so rather than an anarchic society, we may see an apathetic State which condones violence. 

The answer to issues like air pollution and water scarcity has been around for ages, we've only done what we could do to postpone dealing with the question. For air pollution, it's getting people off their vehicles and on to public transport. People reply (and legitimately so) that there is no public transport system. Governments say that they don't have the money to buy buses, although they spend an order of magnitude more on building flyovers and expressways (which only incentivise people to use their vehicles more). It becomes just another vicious cycle. 

Unless all of us come back and take a serious look at the social contract that we have and our roles within it, I think that we're all screwed. Water scarcity will be unbearable, heat and cold waves will kill off an increasing number and violence will possibly increase drastically. Food production might remain stable, but given the changes in rainfall patterns and our agricultural style, I might be being optimistic. The State will continue to function as it currently does, trying to make the best of a terrible hand. 
You and I and everyone else here will possibly continue to live a similar life. We're the elites. The above points are very much valid day by day the quality of life is degrading. Only the rich are immune to this as they dont spend much time on the ground and usually are away.", jawaharlol dhakkarnia k3times nura2011 pythonapster braindead_in chutiyaredditor usefulllinfo dantan-77 whiznu moab911

There is no caste based discrimination in Oracle. It is actually quite opposite of that. The diversity section aims to gather your information to know if a person is coming from any underprivileged or minority background. It is used to provide help, workshops to integrate with people if it is needed for some people. It is also used during any formal complains to determine if one is/was being discriminated due to their race, sex, caste, or religion. Finally, as a company, it is a good PR for them to indicate that employ people from various diverse backgrounds.

Of course, you are free to not disclose that information, it is not mandatory to provide such information to the company. Diversity, as it clearly says there. We get to answer a similar kind of question in North America. Obviously, you can skip it if you want. It's clearly written that it's diversity, and you can choose to not disclose that information. I don't think it's a big deal, especially because there is always the option to skip it. They ask similar questions in Cisco US also. Whether you belong to ethnic minorities etc..

I'm 27 btw. But recently I have realized that there are way many guys still in the backward mentality. Especially the ones who come to the US. I have seen people who are in this crappy mentality that they believe that its their right or they are worth taking dowry and such. I guess its the family and the environment they are brought up in. This system doesn't end until the girl's family change. Women in our generation are brought up the same way as men, educated, working and could be independent. I wish people change but I don't see that happening anytime soon. 1. I won't ask. I won't let my parents ask

2. If they offer I won't say no. I will not give it to my parents. 

3. I will just give it to the bride and expect her to use it as per her needs. 25-30 lacs , Ek Honda Accord , Bullet Enfield (optional though) , 10 lacs ka FD , 20 tola Sona to chahiye matlab chahiye , Marriage expenses on her family , and if my insatiable lust still craves for more then Vietnam ka honeymoon package for 2 weeks. hey, IAS, IPS are in top demand.   
in many cases, among their top priority reasons for choosing the UPSC track: mighty dowry. it runs in mega crores.   

marriage alliance -> big money changes hands -> buys influence and power.  everything else is secondary. NA KHAUGA NA KHAANE DUGA Nope. Won't ask for it. 

It's honestly an insult to ask dowry. I would better die on my own than to demand money from someone, heck especially from someone I am abt to marry.

How can guys even look straight in eye after demanding dowry. It's a sign that you not only see marriage as a business transaction but also that you can't live and struggle on your own. I won't ask... Problem is both ways..... Even the girl side expectations are fucking high....u need to have a palace, fucking big dick car, bank balance , should not work in IT and no loans.... My cousin is getting married to a MLAs daughter... Well he said he didn't ask dowry.... But they are giving him some 50 Lacs worth of gold.... The girl side will always double whatever the guys side gives....



I feel parents are whoring they daughters and sons to who ever bids more.... I got married 14 yrs ago. Didn't give anything. Husband and me split the wedding cost equally. Same with my brother, he didn't take any money. I hope when my kid grows up if she wants to marry someone, she would go for a court marriage and spend that money on something else. Indian men find it difficult to get a woman (love/marriage not kidnapping bs) and on the other hand people are paying men to marry their daughter

Confidence is good but not to the point where you refuse to admit something you did wrong and are stubborn Pretense. 

Particularly trying hard to appear knowledgeable about something specially when they have little to no idea about it. And assuming that the person opposite them will not see though it. 

Instant turn off. As a guy when I see other guys spray like a whole bottle of deodorant or perfume onto themselves, I feel like I am gasping for air. 

I don‚Äôt find drowning oneself in perfume or deodorant attractive The never-ending persistence and ""hasi toh phasi"" attitude. Stop. No means no. I'll crosspost to TwoXindia, many more women there 1. Flashy appearances- this applies to everything from overly-groomed beards and hair, to (shudder) shiny sunglasses, to hypebeast clothing. Your beard doesn't need to look like you used a ruler on it. Your sunglasses aren't for wearing inside, and I don't care if you have Yeezys. Just wear jeans, a t-shirt and clean sneakers, and we're set
2. Humungous muscles- biased here, but I'm into tall and lanky, so muscles don't do anything for me. As long as you're decently toned and don't have fat around your tummy, you're good. 
3. Perfume? I don't know if this is a general male thing, but I've met a few guys who use overpowering perfume. that, combined with sweat in our weather= get me the fuck outta there. Just shower, for the love of god.
4. Gym selfies- no no no no. These aren't making anybody thirsty. Ok, maybe there are a few women who're into it, but I've yet to meet anybody like that. I'm only interested in gym selfies if they're from a guy I'm already interested in, and in that case I'd be interested in anything he posted- dog pics, sceneries, whatever the fuck. Gym selfies don't add any value.
5. Being smooth- don't be afraid to be a little shy and awkward when you're flirting- it's actually cuter than you'd think. Guys who are super smooth can seem a bit like they do this with everyone they meet, and for me that's a turn off
6. Jawlines- there seems to be an obsession with these amongst my generation, and I really don't get it. A 'chiseled' jawline does nothing for me- I honestly couldn't care less, unless you have a double chin. Can we get a reply about attractive stuff too with this? That would help.

Desi breeds need less maintenance and are smart when trained. Mudhol breeds are best if you own a farm. 

Recently they poisoned dogs in Telangana because they were becoming nuisance. I can understand why but, I cant warp my head around why can't we adopt desi breeds.",f0rrestgump,AskIndia," Because for some people dogs are status symbols and they want to get exotic looking ones.

As for dog lovers, it doesn't matter as much which breed it is as long as it fits their lifestyle. I myself like a dog with a smooth coat because I don't want to spend time brushing him and cleaning hairs off my furniture, and I like dogs that can handle being alone in the house and don't require constant attention. 

So I guess a desi breed would suit me perfectly, but I'm also considering Rottweilers and Basenjis. prestige / status symbol .  

""char log kya kehenge"" factor >But he told it needs a lot of maintenance. 


Pretty sure your friend was flexing on how much he spends... Show-off + Stupidity and you get the results Recently a friend of mine wanted to buy a dog which has thick body hair. I told him to buy something with less hair since it won't tolerate our heat. I guess he took my advice. Off-topic but why do people here always equate Husky owners with all other foreign breed owners? You do realize that there are plenty of foreign breeds who need less maintenance and in some cases even lesser than desi breeds. There's only one solution to this. If the government partners with an NGO, they government can detain all the strays and the NGO can take care of them in an adoption facility. You pay a small fee to adopt a dog...just enough for the facility to function. Fewer stray dogs on the streets will lead to more people actually adopting them. Getting a husky in a tropical region is the equivalent of getting a polar bear. One can. We did it few years ago. Unfortunately i had to move out but my flatmate still has and takes care of the Desi dog. Yes you're right, desi dogs can tolerate much heat and requires very less care, I had a desi dog few years ago and he was so good. I made it my pet from streets where it was the only surviving puppy to his mother and was very weak when I took it to my home then he started learning according to our house and spent a good time with us.

Other than that, it‚Äôs honestly great!

They almost always come up with this stupid argument ""Eating non-veg is a sin"" How would you combat this argument if you were me?",vivzkestrel,AskIndia," Most of Hinduism does not refer to any ancient text so this argument of referring to a text book is not entirely correct.  
I believe each person is free to choose.   
You can't win by a logical argument with a person with strong belief.  
It matters down to whether you believe in sin or not. If you don't believe, why be bothered when somebody says it's a sin. Only your conscience needs to be clear. Tell them it's your dharma. You had a dream in which your family deity said that you must eat meat to be pious. 

Or perhaps say you met a Jyotish who told you to eat non-veg to get rid of Ardhnaag dosha. Sprinkle in some Sanskrit words to make it seem legit. 

Perhaps counter them by saying that there is no text which says that meat eating is a sin. 

It's not like they're gonna go and actually check. Even if they do, say that it's ok according to the Vedas, especially if you are a Kshatriya or some other caste. 

If you're a Brahmin, say that there are many communities where Brahmins way meat too, like in some villages in Uttarakhand or Kerala. 

But seriously though, tell them to shut up and mind their own business. Especially if they're in your house. Ignore By saying that *every saint has a past and every sinner has a future* Simple, ask them what constitutes a sin. Which hindu sacred text says a person cant consume meat.

 Also, people during the rig vedic era consumed cow meat regularly. This veg and non veg thing only came when Buddhism and Jainism became a competing religion in India and the Brahmins had to evolve their phylosophy, as hindusim does not have a set religious practice it was easy to just introduced some changes without anyone noticing it. So in short the veg, non veg  thing was a protective measure to curb the rise of Buddhism and Jainism. Depends on the nature of your opponent. If the person you're arguing with is an informed, ethical vegan then walk away. I think in 2019 the ethics of meat eating are pretty dubious.

Eating meat is ethically comparable to - using leather, consuming milk (requires cows to be raped), eating Honey etc. So yeah, you could argue by pointing out their 'sins'. 
If they're coming from a religious perspective then you've got enough examples in the texts of meat consumption. Walk away. [removed] I use a powerful weapon - no u. I tell them they are not feeding me enough good veg food and if they did I would change tomorrow.

Now that I've finished college, I've realised that being brought up in Gujarat was a blessing in disguise. I am not a Gujju or a Telugu, I'm just Indian man. And that's what an Indian should be. Devoid of stupid conditions that I had no control over. As you grow older, you too will realise this.

So go on, go forth and do your thing man. Make yourself proud! Not your Tamil parents or your North Indian friends, just yourself. It is other people's job to accept you for who you are, not yours to convince them to accept you!

Keep doing you! There are dark North Indians too. Some bigoted people will judge you, but be full of your own. I have friends in Delhi of ""Southern"" decent, but you can never tell them apart from a normal Delhi lad. They will jump for any fight, use profane language for breakfast and are full of themselves, just like stereotypical Delhi boys. I was born and brought in the North, while my parents are from the South, who moved here for work. I've never really struggle with identity to be honest, I speak both my native language and Hindi fluently. But yes, I do identify more with North India - be it cuisine, music, culture - but that has never been a hindrance in enjoying my native culture either. I can't read the script though, which is a bummer. 

About the colorism, yeah it did happen in school, but I was fairly confident in myself so it never really bothered me. Whenever they used to call me kalu or whatever, I always used to ask them ""okay, so what about it? Should I feel bad or something?"" to which they never had an answer. It did stop being a problem after 8th-9th grade, after that nobody really ever brought it up. This is how I confuse many Indians by my introduction : ""I'm am from Bhopal ....don't look confused .... my parents are from Kerala""

I guess I have picked the best of both sides, being able to take pride because of achivemenets of both states, in some cases I think like a Bhopali, in some cases I think like a mallu.

The whole ""identity"" business is silly. Everyone has to create their own. # Raftaar I am from Andhra grew up in North. For always my identity in both place was a guy from Andhra. 

Did face some racism issues during my childhood, but as I grew up people around changed a lot.

However the only thing that makes me different from native people is that I think and speak to myself in Hindi. Does exact centre count. Mallu boy bought up in maharashtra. Ended up with 4 languages fluency and an lingering identity crisis. Typically say Jai shivaji  as a internal war cry In the country where I live now - there is a North Indian Association & a South Indian association - I cannot be a member in both because in the words of one of the committee members - I‚Äôm a hybrid - after which he proceeded to laugh as if he cracked a massive joke. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I just wanted to tell you, we could really use more people from South India and NE in this sub.", prym2002 platinumgus18 shallow311 0xffaa00 throwawaysouthindian MrJekyll meinBhiEngineer spider143 A_duThom_ BadAssKnight ThatIndianCoy
Marijuana should be legalized and decriminalized.,219,c02hnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c02hnp/marijuana_should_be_legalized_and_decriminalized/,294,1560437350.0,"The reason Marijuana has been criminalized in India/Nepal in the first place was due to heavy pressure from the U.S about 40 or 50 years ago. Basically they didn't want their people to come to affordable third world countries with no laws on drugs, get high and waste away their lives (and also the roles played by the Cigarette and Alcohol companies ofcourse). 

But with the current state of affairs and over the past few years, we all know that states in the US have been legalizing marijuana, rapidly. And also legal in Canada country wide.

So there's really no basis for keeping it criminalized now, just cause it has been criminalized for the past few decades.

Correct me if i'm wrong.",chet11,AskIndia," Colarado has passed $1 billion in regulated revenue. I think there is a monetory case to be made too. We already tax alcohol, marijuana is less addicting and is definitely less lethal when it comes to DUI incidents. I completely agree with legal marijuana being sold, with high cbd variety products being easily accessible to everyone and high thc products sold in whatever taxed, licensed vends the government wants. Having seen my own family members go through painful cancer treatments and not being able to offer a solution to even help them a little with the pain is heart wrenching. If cbd products are available easily and at low cost, so many people can have access to low cost pain relief marijuana provides. The government can happily tax high thc stuff to fill its coffers like it does in case of Alcohol, Cigarettes etc.
 
We have many areas across the country suitable for a resilient plant like marijuana. It can give rise to a great new segment for farmers who can make a decent amount of money by growing it legally and it will also give passionate youngsters opportunities to develop more cannabis related accesories and products. Even the tourism industry will get a massive boost since India will be the only country in SE asia with legal weed. I love this idea, i just wish it would grow out of reddit and go into our parliament . Yeah but the concern is addiction. Which you can say about alcohol and cigarette too tbf. And I believe they are even more harmful. It could be a  capitalist conspiracy because weed you can grow at home but you need someone to produce alcohol/cigarette. Money for the businessmen and tax for the government.

Plus it is also widely referred to as the gateway drug which really does not work in its favour for legalization. I think our best shot is a PIL for medical use exception in the short term. The last Government has given a go ahead to CSIR to explore medicinal uses of cannabis. That amounts to implicit acknowledgement of it's medicinal qualities. There is no valid reason why CSIR or government agencies should have a monopoly on that. It is discriminatory and violates our rights. At this rate, only big pharma will reap the benefits. 

However, full legalization will take a long time given the opposition to it. The clamor in mainstream media has been growing (e.g. an [a recent article](https://qz.com/india/1632037/modi-must-legalise-cannabis-to-tackle-indias-agrarian-distress/), especially around the business/medical aspects of it. At the governmental level the latest was the PMO had [asked the opinion](https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/check-benefits-of-cannabis-prime-minister-s-office-tells-health-ministry/story-JJWPQSKcway1zX9zbQ7HLN.html) of the Health Ministry. With a new Health Minister, it's anybody's guess.

I think we need learn from the strategies employed the cannabis legalization movements in US and the gay rights movement in India. The roadmap others have followed is:

1. Medical use exception
2. Decriminalization of recreational use
3. Legalization.

India banned cannabis due to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs treaty, but WHO's stance has now changed especially with regards to the medicinal use. Even CSIR is exploring [drugs based off cannabis](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/csir-iiim-boheco-to-develop-cannabis-based-drugs-for-cancer-epilepsy-sickle-cell-anemia/articleshow/66773628.cms). Given the facts, I think the government will have a hard time defending the current NDPS law which outright bans all uses of cannabis flower in the Supreme Court.

The second and third steps will take a long time and I think we need a PR and awareness campaign for it. First we should stop calling it cannabis and instead call it bhang/ganja. These two words have much better recall and brand value to us. Social media can play a big role as well. The use of cannabis is on the rise amongst the youth and we should exploit that.

What's unfortunate is that the West has a lead in legalized marijuana business right now and we are being left out, whereas we are the rightful ""heirs"" of this Industry. India has long historical record of cannabis use. The West forced this ban and are now stealing the market away from us. This narrative has not been given it's due in the mainstream media. Not just marijuana, they should also legalize LSD, psilocybin (mushrooms) and MDMA. 100% agree. This thread is epic. [deleted] Marijuana is also a part of our culture so more of a reason to legalise it.  Marijuana  has great use in Ayurveda, esp to relive pain! You are only thinking from the point of view of educated, middle class and above individuals. It's a small number as compared to the large uneducated or poor people. Giving them this option, which will be marketed by sellers like anything would be a major havoc on the society.

Never boarded a plane before. Do they allow using phones while in air?,49,cdxr6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdxr6b/never_boarded_a_plane_before_do_they_allow_using/,68,1563316084.0,Also what are some stuffs should I know about the plane and airport in general? Going to Andaman on September 30.,TheUnfaithfulUser,AskIndia," You can use your phone on flight mode. They'll issue a notice when it's safe to use your phone.

About general air travel, make sure you reach a couple of hours before the flight departs. Go to your airline counter, show them your ticket (don't forget to carry an ID, you won't be allowed inside the airport without it.), get your boarding pass which will have the details of the location from where your flight will take off. Go to that gate and wait for boarding. (If it's a silent airport, keep checking when your flight opens for boarding.)

You're usually allowed to carry 7 kgs of hand luggage, rest you have to put in while getting your boarding pass. Post landing, you have to find the belt on which your luggage would arrive and wait there.

Have a safe journey OP. Do not put power bank in the luggage which you are planning to check in. Power bank is allowed in cabin baggage only. Now you can finally use the ""Flight Mode"" in your phone officially. Dont's

1. Do not utter words like bomb, terrorist, hijack etc under any circumstances. This restriction will be from the time you leave home till you reach your hotel etc. Do not even watch any video or film related to plane hijack, terrorism or bombs. You could get into serious trouble.




2. Do web checkin in advance, sometimes if a flight is overbooked they will not allow you to board the flight.




3. Do not stuff your cabin luggage with food to eat on the plane, chances are it will be confiscated.




4. Do not be hero when the plane is in the air, keep seat belt fastened at all time




5. Don't be afraid to ask, if you are unfamiliar with something. So, I see a lot of people talking about putting phone on flight mode. As someone that has travelled in planes, I don't really see a point of it apart from saving battery life as you aren't going to get network in the air. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/phone-airplane-mode-flight-explained-2017-7?IR=T

So, for your question, about using phone in air.  You don't necessarily need to put it on flight mode and there is no need for switching it off, you should put it on airplane mode to save battery, as phone will try to get signal and waste battery otherwise
You can use bigger gadgets like iPad or laptop once you are stable in air, just safety precaution that flights want to 

Follow instructions and behave properly. 

Carry IDs, and adjust your bags for weight in advance. Not every flight enforces the 7 kgs limit, but still try to keep the bag only as big as required and close to it as there isn't much space in overhead compartments. 

Ideally, don't take sharp objects or lighters with you, if you do, keep it in checkin luggage, the weight of which is enforced a bit more strictly.

Power banks in cabin luggage. I've always wondered how a radio signal can bring down a fucking 150 ton plane. Ask the stewardess, will you? Not related to the post but wanted to say have a great journey. 

Do not miss out on Havelock Island and Scuba Diving in North Bay Island. You'll love it For God's sake, do not stand up and start taking luggage, the moment the wheels touch down. Wait till it come to a complete halt. 

&#x200B;

Basically just listen and follow the instructions announces. Remember, the person who snaps off their seatbelt as soon as the wheels touch the ground on landing is given an award. Also make sure that you observe the people at the security gate. Every damn airport I go to has some of its own rules and processes for going through security. Some will ask you to remove the phone/wallet and keep it in the bag. Others will ask you to keep it in the plastic bin. 

Just observe what everyone is doing and follow suit If its just about phone use:

- it needs to be off or in airplane mode during take off and landing
- during flight u can use your phone, but expect no network / signal once u are a couple of hundred metres into the air. Masts send signal down to the ground where users are, not up into the air", goxul arvindbhatt tmkco buddy_maga dontknow_anything syntaxerror89 CoroIsMyDaddy foolish_thinker CanadianOCIFIRE mrfreeze2000 mchp92

Because we are chutiyas and consideration for fellow citizens is not in our DNA. dont forget they use the horn every 0.05 seconds. cause travelling fast isnt good enough The ones who overtake have tiny egos. I have ridden all around South and few cities in the North, West and Central but Pondicherry is the absolute worst. I'd even say rest of India sane and safe driving compared to Pondy. I reached Pondicherry yesterday and already cunts rammed into my bike twice.

I'll also go

Because in most cities there is no one to stop them from doing that and breaking the rules + going fast is cool. 


Drive safe please. Obviously human consideration and courtesy shouldn't have to be taught, but I do think a big reason is that our driving lessons don't talk about this things. Nothing about cutting someone off, overtaking rashly, tailgating, lane discipline.. I can see why so many who drive just think these aren't important. Because anyone driving slower than us is an idiot while anyone driving faster than us is a maniac. Most of them don‚Äôt start early from their houses or plan ahead. Another reason being narrow roads. It‚Äôs like a domino effect. If the person behind you is annoying you by honking to go quickly then you will naturally do the same to the one in front of you. And weirdly enough few of them see reaching their destination earlier than average time as some kind of accomplishment regarding their driving/riding skill.", poopgiver try2tame lordatlas danescrossing unstablevolatile harblstuff rohithkumarsp disgusting_profile2 ctownlife 16avril adi_LK

But with the recent movie release, I got a little curious to check his background. I recently came to know that there is another part of story, apparently this guy is shady, & has another coaching which acts as a screening for super 30, & its not free. Even the  identity of students part of ""Super 30"" is left unknown. 

Here's a link about an expose by Dainik Jagran, 

https://www.newslaundry.com/2018/07/27/will-dainik-jagran-prove-to-be-super-30-heros-nemesis",Noob_in_making,AskIndia," Exactly. The guy chooses the top 30 rankers from his other coaching. If FIITJEE did that they could make a super 1000 with a 90%+ success rate. [deleted] Lmao they're so out of ideas that they're making movies on cracking an exam

I hope it's three hours of some kid just scribbling anxiously on paper >Interestingly, Anand Kumar hasn‚Äôt responded to any of the allegations, though *Dainik Jagran* asked him to reply to the published expose.

Any particular reason for not responding? The founders need to answer the questions. Giving different companies receipt on the time of admission, I suspect a tax fraud. He's not. 
Read some time ago he has a seperate coaching where almost 1000 student study and super 30 is different. If someone from super 30 does not do any good, they publish results from the other coaching. What about the thing where the super 30 students are from low-income families? Is there any truth in that? I was a student their back in 2008 . I thought it is public how he run his business.  I have taken admission to study math in his tution class . For this the fee was around 6-7 k .He used to run 3 -4 batch daily of around 300 students in each batch  which was only for the math . 

 The super 30 we are talking about , one has to clear the exams  in which the questions were nonetheless straight from JEE level , so it was no wonder those folks clearing the exam . Everyone knows this around their atleast people from Patna . There is a friend in my class from super 30 and by his words he claimed it is not true. What's wrong here?

Family conspiring to get me married,96,c9tadp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9tadp/family_conspiring_to_get_me_married/,84,1562446484.0,"Hello,

I'm a 22 year old south Indian woman. I have just finished my U.G, and I'm not ready for marriage. I recently found out my parents have been sending pictures of my Astrological chart (Khundali or Jatagam) to marriage brokers and I even suspect my dad took a photo of mine and gave to some marriage broker in my village. I have previously told my parents very seriously that i will never marry and even if I ever did He will never be of our community (narrow gene pool) they have agreed to it and promised me nothing would be done without my permission. I still want to study, work and travel the world (i know  clich√©). And when it comes to marriage i will only do it after dating  and I want the marriage ceremony to be done in a temple without wasting money and creating a scene. I know legally no one can force me into marriage but I feel betrayed, sad and isolated, I trusted my parents now I feel like they don't prioritize my happiness. I can never envision myself living a life like most girls in my community (marrying an older guy who is a far cousin and basically serving him and his family and giving birth until they get a son). I still depend on my parents for money for my further studies abroad so I can't fully cut them out. What do I do now should i confront them which will lead to a huge argument or should i just stay quite and go on with life. I know this post is a huge mess and way to long but i have no one to talk to about this and my friends find it weird and baffling about how I plan to live and obviously they don't understand how i feel. Please give me any advise on how i should react to this and let me know if you are someone like me so i could finally have a friend who understands .

sorry for the loooong post

Thank you",Flowingnebula,AskIndia," Current strategy should be delaying it as much as possible citing that you want to at least complete your education first. Leave for a Masters and focus on financial independence. Once that‚Äôs achieved, proper confrontation would be the way forward. Surprise them. Convince them to let you go abroad for a master‚Äôs degree. Then never come back.

Second option is to get a job somewhere far away. Sit down and have a word with Ur parents , having an argument now is way better than living with regret for the rest of Ur life . Completing Ur education should be Ur first priority .. travelling the world , landing a job ,live in relationship , marriage   would follow eventually .... You seem nice. Either be an adult and stop relying on your family for money so you can tell them to fuck off and do whatever you want, or keep getting spoon-fed and do what they tell you to do.  Sounds like you want to have the cake and eat it too, but that‚Äôs not how life works. Start the emotional blackmailing before they do. Parents are probably the last entities anybody should ever trust.


This is my advice,

- don't say anything besides 'I don't want to get married right now' .. don't explain, don't justify, do not defend, don't argue. Just plain broken record, very neutral tone. If they prod more, say that's just how it is right now, then repeat, I don't want to get married right now. The less you explain the less authority you give them on your life. 

.

- get a job somewhere else, like Delhi, far away, if they oppose just tell them it's for 6 months only then your employers will assign you locally (but they won't).

.

- becoming financial independent fast means saving like 80% of your salary, pick a safe mutual fund. I honestly don't mean to be rude but I find it difficult to understand why financially independent people regardless of gender but especially women care so much about what their parents have planned for them. I mean you're not in a position where you absolutely have to listen to them, right? If you don't wanna get married, don't. Why ruin your life over your parents whims? Talk it out. If it doesn't work, get a job, asap. Move to metro. Live by your own rules, then. As a fellow South Indian who has seen a few cousins fall into these traps, I can relate with this so much.

I think the best way to make parents understand that marriage isn't their choice is to show them that while you love and respect them, it doesn't necessarily mean that you are willing to let them control every single aspect of your life.

Secure your education and Financial freedom. Then sit down with your parents and make them understand that marriage is a choice that you and you alone get to make. Do not let them blackmail you emotionally.

Make it clear that you aren't willing to relinquish control over your life. Sure, it is going to hurt them a bit. But it is necessary.  It is the better route for the long run.", zizakk morlock77 rascalnikov_dost Paree264 Jarheadmatic UebuNogami imerence_ nofap2010 InfiniteAgony throawayman20 lonerwithboner

Unfortunately, most of the subreddits are oriented towards the US and Europe.

So I figured I'd ask: any daily/regular use items that are available in India that you feel have been worth the cost and would recommend? Especially if they're reasonably environmentally friendly/sustainable? 

Specific things I've been on the hunt for include:

1. High quality towels
2. Cooking appliances and Utensils
3. Handheld vacuum cleaners

Things I've had recent success with:

1. Bicycle - I bought a low-end single speed bike from Decathlon that's been great to maintain and ride and has been perfect really.
2. Clothing - I've started either buying fabric and getting it stitched, or going to high end sustainable/slow-fashion boutiques like Lila in Delhi. They're a little pricier but they look brilliant and seem to stand the test of time far better than my cheaper clothes
3. Baking tins/tiffins - these are so cheap in India but last forever which is so great.",Crantankerous,AskIndia," Samsonite luggage is pricey but so much better than anything on the market

Nike's products haven't let me down so far

Decathlon is great. I shop all my travel gear from there.

For t shirts, look up 'next' brand on myntra/jabong/nnnnow. They're a british brand that makes basic designs. Great quality that lasts, and relatively affordable too.

FabIndia had become shit but they've gone back to their old standards. Their clothes now last me years.

For shoes, look at next and Clarks. If you have the cash, splurge on some Timberlands. They'll last you half a lifetime

Wildcraft is also really good This thread is going to be 1.6 LPM..

I guarantee it... Thread from last time : https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6d74cz/what_are_some_indian_buy_it_for_life_products/ Crizal lenses for people who wear specs.

They are damn expensive but it has severed me good so far, I bought their privenzia which has blue light filter this is like having default f.lux on my eyes! Decathlon also has some good discounts going on on clothing which runs cheaper than local stores. I've got some of their shirts and shorts. They are good to wear casually or at home. 

I love good footwear but it's impossible to find well fitting durable ones made in India. Or one has to choose very expensive foreign brands which have good ones. Like mentioned in another comment Liberty used to have good sandals but have since reduced in quality. If anyone has found good quality Indian sandals with lasting soles do comment. 

Unfortunately in my experience not many Indian products last long like that. Exceptions would be pressure cookers which are well made and help cooking. You could get that metal spice smasher which can crush garlic etc and will last long. More traditional products probably last more but getting harder to find. 

Glare knives are good value. Had one in chennai but the handle is melting now but the blade is still good enough after years. If anyone knows which store these are stocked let me know. Edit: its available on amazon but the shipping is almost as high as product.

Sennheiser earphones are good and have a 2 year warranty which is needed when one side fucks up eventually as they always do. I've heard they honor the warranty and replace. Do comment about your experience with their service.

Borosil based vessel which can help making baked items etc. Unbraded Cast iron pans are available but no idea if they are safe to cook on etc. Foreign brands are ridiculously expensive.

A good water bottle will serve you well. Look out at big local kitchen stores which might stock local good ones.

Bombay dyeing has good bedsheets albeit expensive. Towels check out Khadi or village cooperatives which offer nice cotton ones at a decent price.

Don't know if they still maintain the same quality tho **Woodlands footwear** . I've been using their products since 10+ years and a pair of their sandals last atleast 2+ years. I would advice to buy from their outlets rather than online since there are a lot of fakes. 

**Swiss Gear Backpack** They come with a 5 year warranty . I use one which can take my laptop, iPad ,books and 2 water bottles. Very well made with useful compartments. auqagaurd - water purifier. Oh boy I have quite a list here. From personal experience:

- Samsung appliances & electronics. My parents bought a fridge, washing machine, and microwave oven all together. 15 years on, they still work like a charm. We've serviced each item about only once. Oh, their ACs too.
- American Tourister/Samsonite backpacks. The only thing that even gets destroyed is the back cushion on the former (since it's less premium than Samsonite), but only if the bag has faced a ton of abuse like mine did).
- Nike shoes. I wear my pairs out in 2-3 years. Buy them on Flipkart/Amazon during their sales and you're sorted. My pair worth 2k just goes on.
- Relaxo hawai chappal. 80 bucks a pair. One has definitely outlasted my Nikes.
- Essilor Crizal spec lenses. If you look at screens every living second, your eyes will thank you for this.
- Woodland shoes. They just refuse to get damaged to an unwearable point.
- Aquaguard. My grandmother bought hers around 2000-01. We haven't even bothered to buy a new one ever since. 
- Skodas (or any car from a German brand or German-owned brand). The cost for oils and whatnots are huuuge compared to Marutis. What you don't notice is that they've never needed spare part changes unlike the WagonR we had, even with 10 years of daily use.
- Tupperware. No further description needed.

Definitely go for Victorinox or W√ºsthof Knives. They hold their edge for longer period and is a joy to use. You can't go back to cheapo knives afterwards. 

For crockery I recently found out about corelle. A US brand. Apparently they are unbreakable and comes along with lifetime guarantee. I tried breaking them by dropping and they just bounce off.

Help me not fuck up this Tinder date,32,cby435,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cby435/help_me_not_fuck_up_this_tinder_date/,98,1562893257.0,"Hey,

I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago and I've been looking into getting back in the game. I set up Tinder and after a few dozen matches (all of the other conversations died out), I finally set up a coffee date with one girl! She's pretty cute, at least in the picture, and I don't want to fuck this up. All the relationships I've had in the past were with girls I've known for a long time (both of my previous girlfriends were from school and college, so I knew them well before starting a relationship). This is the first time I'm going on a date with a complete stranger. We talked a bit on Tinder and I know what she does and stuff, but there's still a lot I don't know about her, and one of the goals of this coffee date is so we can talk more about ourselves and see if we are compatible. Or, at least, that's my plan. She might just be using me for free coffee lol I don't know, but it's worth the chance I think, because she is kinda cute.

Any advice? What to start with? What to talk about and what to possibly avoid? This is the first actual ""stranger-date"" I've been to so I'm sorta nervous haha.

Thanks, all!",IntegralCosecantXdX,AskIndia," I want such problems in life Just don't think of it as a date. You are out with your friend. Make her feel comfortable and joke around a little. Keep things light enough yet not too light. If the weather's nice, ask her if she wants to go for a walk after coffee. There's something about walking side by side at the same pace. Best way is to go there with a fun, positive outlook. Trust me, a guy‚Äôs cheery smile & attention while talking can make a woman‚Äôs day especially after a long day at college/work. 

Also, I‚Äôve always been complimented for being one of the few guys who looks into their eyes when talking. I also use my eyes to subtly express interest in them. 

My objective on first date is to walk away feeling - it‚Äôs a good date for me & for her to walk away saying - wow! What a fab date!  

Then subsequent dates there is no flaking.

The objective of the first date is to see if you want to do another date again or not. 

All the best! Don‚Äôt think much & have a great time! Remember, sex is never for free. When you‚Äôre married, you will pay for it through your nose. dont think too much.

just be yourself.

i went on a date. and  the girl paid for food. she came by taxi went by one.

so you never know whats out there Whatever you do just don't go for the date in an Activa . Just don't. Somebody is in love. 1. Don't reveal everything about yoursrlf. Keep it intriguing 2. Don't try to come across desperate 3. Don't make it an interview 4. Just be normal Alright OP, first things first - don't take Reddit's two rules for dating to heart since they're not rooted in reality. 

What you need to keep in mind instead are the following - 

1. Don't hog the conversation - I see so many men fall into this trap of just droning on and on about themselves in a bid to impress. That should not be your goal. Good listeners are rare enough to be impressive. 

2. Ask good questions - Anything that sounds too interview-y should be out. If you know anything about her likes or interests, asking her about how she got into it would be a good start. Basically, anything that opens up into larger topics is ideal.

3. Do not discuss past relationships - It's just the first date. No time and place to dig up the ghost of your exes. 

4. When it comes to first-date flirting, less is more - Keep it subtle. Lay off the filthy joke you heard in office. Don't use that pick up line you read in some men's forum. A tasteful compliment goes a long way in alleviating that awkward silence. 

5. DO NOT GET INTO INTELLECTUAL DEBATES WHERE YOU PLACE HER IN A POSITION TO PROVE HERSELF RIGHT - God, this is the most exhausting and infuriating part of any conversation. If she likes something that's not necessarily up your alley, it's alright. Let her be. 4 hour and 874536 comments long debate threads are neither fun online or offline. 

6. Finally, once it's done, walk her out, tell her you had a lovely time and ask her to text you once she gets home safe. 

Le fin. I hope it's a great first date, OP and I'm glad to see you putting in the effort to make it one. Do keep us posted on how it went. 

TL;DR - you just have to be polite and sweet. That's it. That's all it takes. Where can I find a guy like you? Because all of the guys I matched up with on tinder wanted to hook up. 

Pay for the first date. See if she offers to pay for the second date. Let me tell you, not all girls are looking for a relationship on tinder. Be yourself but don't be an idiot. Girls pay attention to every single thing like how you interact with strangers, your facial behavior etc. Do not engage yourself on phone calls and texts. Go somewhere where it's easier to open up and talk. I am a guy but I usually hear Indian men get too comfortable or ask very personal questions.

Just play cool, relax, don't ask too many deep questions, or assume you are partners already.", bhootbilli ParkingDriver7 BadAssKnight brownlust CharmingDeer super_banker braindead_in Def-tones Schneidsteiger blackjourrnal noematter

How did your life turned out after studying engineering. Did go get what you were sold?,Oxeam3,AskIndia," Jobless, Life is shit. Was really passionate about Computer Science when I was in my +2. Ended up at a Tier 1 college but got Electronics instead of CS. It was pretty traumatic but got a decent job as a data analyst. Lots of ups and downs but its been better than the doom and gloom stories I've heard from others over the years On randia, posting rants. Did engineering. Nothing happened. Did Masters in Engineering. Got a call from a good company for the interview. I was in very bad shape due to arthritis and the location was 14 hours train journey from my place. Still I went there, cracked the interview, came back with the job offer. 5 years back.

I feel that engineering was good. I learn a lot (did self study), enjoyed with friends, attended events. In SBI as Assistant Manager. Not recommended. Tier 1 college, placed in an MNC with decent pay for a fresher. Kal hi pehla din tha. Office infra, khaana sab sahi toh lag raha hai.
Kaam ab dekhte hai kaisa milta hai.
The only issue I am facing is commute. Fucking 2 hours ka round trip hai mera. Did my engineering. and got placed in 2 companies. Refused the offer from one which provided joining date, the other got delayed due to the recession. FOR 2 FUCKING YEARS. So while I came out of college with 2 offers, I sat jobless for 2 years. Did a apprenticeship for meagre pay in the meantime, left that for a partime course in IITD (embedded and multimedia). Wrote government exams in the meantime. Cracked one government exam and joined, never to look back. Pay is decent (not that high, but due to no pressure and good work life balance i feel it is good), life is chill! Jobless Hated all non computer related papers in engineering. Didn't get placed. Did masters. Got placed in a good job. Learnt a lot and switched to another company doing the similar things. Good pay, good challenging work, good life good balance. Did ISE in a Tier 3 college. Graduated around 3 years back. 
Got placed in TCS, but I said fuck that and joined a start-up. I'm still working at the same place and making decent money (~10 lpa). If I look outside I can make much more, but the work here is good and timings are flexible so kinda settled down here for now. 
Life is mostly good, I guess. Mentally I'm a wreck, but I can earn well and give my parents some comforts which they could not afford earlier, so that fact gives me strength and joy. Last moment pe padhna aa gaya hai. 

Har baat pe gaali dena aa gaya hai. 

Engineering ke alava har cheez mein interest aa gya hai.

If you can crack the top 20, be it IITs or the NITs, log izzat karte hai aapki aur karni bhi chaiye, aapne JEE crack kara hai. 

People say, after two years of engineering, your work ex will count, but what they fail to understand is that the companies will themselves discriminate between the students, so kaika work ex.

My parents were like a different kind of strict. They weren't open about it but they kept a very close watch on me from very young age. They were also very religious and tried to make me the same. They really didn't even allow me to hang out with friends, so before I left for college after class 12, I didn't really have any close friends. I never stayed in a friend's place, I never went to watch movies with friends, I can barely count the number of birthday parties I attended with fingers in one hand, and I didn't really celebrate my own birthday. I basically didn't talk to girls at all, and engineering college didn't help in this regard either. Bloomed very late in this regard, and I later got a girlfriend and got married to her too, and I sometimes think I missed this experience in my younger age, when I had lesser responsibility and stuff.    

Having said that, I know that many guys of my generation and even younger than me still don't experience stuff like this, the girls thing is not a major regret. The friends thing is though.. I really wish I had some close friends from my school days. Civic sense. First world way of life.

Survey : How many of you guys(men) would fully support your spouse even in cases where they have to relocate to another city or county for few months?

Also would you expect anything different from them if the situation were reversed ?",LifeWastedOnLiving,AskIndia," If I don't have a job and she is a sole bread earner. Then sure. Have done that.
Relocated to another state to support wife and her career. Was working a dream job as cfo.
 No regrets. Would do it again if have to. I always think about this. Even though I have no job, but yeah I do think about it.

Here's the rule I made : Whoever is earning less, leaves the job provided they are in a position to get a job in the new city too. This is actually quite a broad question. For all naysayers and nodders, the answer would be quite personal and circumstantial depending on the job they have. For instance, a programmer may not find it difficult to find a job in another city as compared to a general sales executive. 

Personally, I'd support her to relocate to a city and a new country as well. However, depending on my situation I may not move with her, assuming her stay there is temporary. I and my wife have had this discussion and I am okay with this. I would happily agree if I find a job there and she wants it really from her heart. I have done that (not my spouse but my gf). She found a role that really excited her in Pune and I was in Mumbai. You might think Mumbai - Pune isn‚Äôt long-distance but it is as good as living in Delhi. By the time you reach home in Pune 1/2 day is wasted traveling. 

Few months of that, found myself a role which wasn‚Äôt SUPER exciting but it wasn‚Äôt bad either. Took a personal call and wanted to make relationship work. At the end of the day it matters what you think is important. I couldn‚Äôt justify making her give up that opportunity. 

Moved. Lived there. Broke up. Found new gf. Married her. Moved out of India. Regret nothing. Pune is my favorite city in India now. 

Wife is a housewife due to insane visa rules, she regrets it slightly but is happy for the two of us. Relocate for ""few months "" . That's the key word. What happens after ""few months"" ? 

I am ok if it is permanent relocation , if it is for few months, bitch please !!! MSV If she takes care of my expenses, yes. Actually I am willing to become a househusband if my wife earns a good salary and supports me. Relocate to different city - fine.

Relocate to different country - Na na na na na re na re na re na na na na na re na re na re. I would, provided she was earning significantly better in the new job or her job is extra ordinary. I wouldn't move for an ordinary job (either acc to work/money), neither would I would expect her to move if I get a bland job in some far away state.", Oxeam3 Marole2902 throawayman20 fordemocracy MasterApotheosis shotslagale banker_boy2 gunnyise BottledBadass Shellynoire VikasNotFound

Don't really need to explain our case Hum Gareeb desh hain. Yeh sab allergies are first-world issues! >Is it due to lack of awareness or something else?   

lack of awareness does not cause allergies.

have you seen friends / relatives that were eating all filthy roadside food here, and then stayed abroad for 18months and come back for a visit , eat idli sambar and get diarrhea ? coz their immune system has gone weak thanks to the sterile environment in Amrikka. Because Indians have been eating all kinds of potentially allergic food since time immemorial, and natural selection has done  what it does best.

It comes in form of subtle concerns such as ""Oh, people will start thinking there is something wrong with you"" and shit. Geez, relax you fucking 'relatives'. I am 31, not 80. Even 80 year olds are dating and finding partners. I want to take time and focus on myself and my hobbies. Who cares what age I settle in or even not settle for that matter. I may find someone I want to marry at 35,40,45 or not at all. Does it diminish any joy in life? Hell no! Yeah, sometimes it feels like it would be nice to have a partner, but it's foolish to think about what you don't have rather than what can be enjoyed right now. Even though I logically understand that I will be just fine and hopefully find a partner in future, this judgement by relatives (and sometimes even friends) undermines my confidence and makes me think that I should get 'settled' first before enjoying life.

Figure out things that are more important and make your decision. You're certainly not gonna take 2 hours every day for cooking and cleaning. Unless you're making a 3 course meal every day.    
  
&nbsp;  
  
In my case, my workplace is in Bellandur which is a traffic cesspool, except early morning and an hour or so in noon and late night. The pollution and population are quite high and there is no water (borewells have dried up and there isn't cauvery connection). If I were to go out to a gym or a sporting facility or a theatre or to a restaurant or to catch up with friends, I'd be stepping out into a sea of traffic and dust and smoke. There really is no escaping traffic. Swiggy also takes time because the delivery boys can't escape it either. The area isn't really safe, people aren't friendly, neighbours keep changing every month and thefts and mugging are common. The only positives are the low rent and less time spent in office commute.  
  
The place is currently stay in is the polar opposite of this, except for the rent. It's almost the same, but it's a much better neighbourhood, a proper residential layout that's calm and quiet. With trees and parks and significantly lower pollution levels. All amenities that matter to me (restaurants of all kinds and budgets, gyms, sporting facilites, theatres, malls etc) are around nearby and there is negligible traffic in this area. But the traffic to work-commute is high and stressful. I can however leave home early and work early and still takes 45-60 mins each side. This is a compromise I make to have a life and thus a work-life balance.  
  
There is another neighbourhood that's somewhere in between these two in terms of my requirements. The commute would take only around 15-20 mins but the costs are much higher. Rent itself is 2x. All restaurants and amenities are up-scale and so those costs are higher too. Although the frustration in traffic made me consider this place a few times, it made no financial sense to me. It wasn't like I was gonna end up bankrupt or anything. I'd still have some savings, but at this point of time in life, I want more. I've found that paying higher rent is always worth it if it cuts down your commute time. Anything over 30-45 minutes one way and you're looking at being so exhausted when you come home that you will have zero time for side projects.

Those side projects can very well turn into ventures that can pay the difference in rent easily. I had a similar situation a year ago. Stay far away, save money with rent, may be have a better social life or stay close to the office, expensive place only as as option but no hassle with the traffic. I chose the second option and I don't regret to this day. When the daily travels becomes monotonous, it slowly starts sucking your life. I would rather reach home in 10-15 minutes after work and do or something productive than stay in traffic half my life. Of course, I could not buy a car or something luxurious but frankly I am okay with it. 1.5 hrs total or 1 side? Find a job in a different city. Bangalore isn‚Äôt getting better anytime soon. Find a nice PG near your office! That should solve most of your problems except for I think Laundry. Hi, 

Pollution levels in Bangalore are higher than any other metropolitan city in India. Also studies proved that longer commuting in hazardous noise&air pollution causes mental stress and decrease your productivity at work rapidly. 

But 3 hrs is too much for me. I'd rather be jobless than travel that much time in that much pollution. üôèüôè I'm seeing a lot of people saying just to go for the rent to save the time. I would be on the same boat but damn 60% of your salary on rent is way too much. And on top of that, you'll get stuck in a rental agreement while it seems like you are not a 100% confident with your new job. I'd recommend stretch out your situation right now for a little longer. 1.5 hours commute absolutely sucks, but right now almost all your salary is adding to your savings which is a great jump start to your finances. I would say in the meantime try to find a more affordable place or try to find a friend who you can split the rent with. 

In the end though, it's really upto you. Is this commute starting to drain you out too much? In that case it's better to put mental health first and money second. Do you think you can keep this up for longer until you are 100% confident with the job? That's great for your finances and luckily you have a two day weekend to catch up with social life. Totally worth moving close to office, even if it's expensive, you will have lot of time to invest in yourself.

If you are spending 3hrs a day, with all the pollution and stress, that's close to 3 days worth spent in commute every month

> And if I live alone, almost 2 hours will go daily on doing cooking, washing utensils, buying groceries, etc.

Cooking and cleaning are essential life skills, and will help you big time with stress and budgeting, and try to buy only bare necessities (probably second hand) First things first, start pitching in financially in the household. Buy groceries on the weekend, help in cleaning up the place and learn easy to make dishes while you are still at your brothers. Prepare your ass for adult life.

You will make friends at the office and if its large enough you will find plenty of living options your colleagues use. Learn from them and and start seeing places after work. Don't limit yourself to a 1BHK/RK but look at 2 or 3BHK's as well as 2/3 BHK's which have an empty room. Living alone is not recommended if you are new to adulting.

I found a good friend looking to move out, learned some cooking before I moved out and learned more from him along with household management while I pitched in by taking over groceries and household products and bills while looking online for deals for furniture/appliances etc. Did you try any carpooling apps?

Second dose of Rabipur is generally not required within six months from first dose. The exact system is a little complicated with categorisation as per scratch/bite, but he says not required for six months even for bites.

But, I'll still suggest get a second opinion. You should bite that dog now to complete the circle You need two booster doses intramuscularly (0.5ml/1ml) or CCVs intra-dermally (0.1 ml at 1 site) on days 0 and 3. Not a doctor, but this happened with my father too and his doctor advised to not go for another shot if the dog has bitten within 5 months of getting the vaccine during the first encounter. Though he got one tetanus shot, don't know the reason. Hope this helps. Bad luck dude !!!!! No need to worry.

It is required by the specifications that poles should be grounded one way or the other. One can assume that since the poles are fixed into the ground, it's automatically earthed. This is not the case. The poles are fixed using cements and this isn't any ground. You need to have a proper grounding for every pole that carries LV greater than 100V.

What's wrong with Indian parents?,65,cdxszg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdxszg/whats_wrong_with_indian_parents/,37,1563316344.0,"Every week I see some horrifying news about abuse caused by parents and how low their mentality is.

Today I read in news, A father killed his pregnant daughter for marrying against his wishes even tho the guy whom she married is from same caste. Like wtf why????

Why they hate love marriage soo much? Is there anything bigger than their children's happiness? What's wrong with them?

Also why they are soo dominating? Are kids puppet or what? They don't even let their kids decide/choose their career and nor life partner in many cases. Comparing their child with others, woh sharma ji ka ladka and all. Seriously what if we kids compare our parents with others? Will they like it?",throwaaway14342169,AskIndia," Most of the indian parents are conformist.

 This problem has deeper roots. These parents were born and brought in a strict childhood where they were refrained from having open conversation with their own parents. They cant hang with opposite sex, stand up to their father or have a proper sex education. Asking questions were a matter of disrespecting one's own parents. Since they had a repressed childhood, they also started associating themselves with this mentality. For them marriage is a universal cure (after gaumutra+gobar) to every problem in life. Third cure is having lots and lots of kids. I think following are some of the reason too for these violent acts:-

1. Women are an object of pleasure and their sole job is to satisfy your hunger and lust. Its men's responsibility to decide what right for his wife. 


2. Elders can never be wrong. The idea of ageism has deep roots in our society. We are told to respect and touch feet of elderly. Why? Nobody knows. Doesnt matter if that unkill/antii is good towards you or not you have to touch feet and give respect. Respect of an elderly is very fragile. It can be broken by a child who doesnt touch feet.


3. Religion plays a very important role. Various indian scriptures promotes casteism and discrimination among humans. Bhagvad geeta itself assign godly task to brahmins and menial tasks to shudras(Reason: cause they're born this way). The scripture abhor relationship between lower and upper castes.


4. Parents impose their unfulfilled hopes and aspiration on their kids. Doesnt matter what he/she wants to become. They kill the curiosity and interest toward studies by force feeding it to you. As a child we are constantly nagged to not waste time and study, which became a thing to hate. We aren't told to enjoy the subject, instead we are taught to choke and barf it on the exam day. By not letting children ask question we kill their creativity and passion to make something new.


Tl;dr: Cultures with a predisposition for violence are composed of individuals who have been deprived- during atleast one of two critical stages in life, infancy and adolescence-of the pleasure of the body. Their every action depends on what other will think. That's it. They want their sons/daughters to be IAS officers not because of Serving the nation, etc etc but because of the so called respect they'll get from the people. Same applied to school course selection, college, marriage, then when to have kids, etc etc. How does killing someone, getting arrested & put behind bars for the rest of your life preserve your honor, I never know they don't. Not at all  A normal person wouldn't kill someone  because they'd have a conscience. But some people lack Conscience which is also closely related to spectrum of emotions we call love. Although we expect a parent to have this feeling for their offspring, a psychopath wouldn't have it and to make matters worse we can't tell the difference during the course of our ordinary lives. 

1% of population are psychopaths with some of them having no concept of conscience. Lack of remorse is also a trait. Nothing wrong with my parents bruh... They cool News link : https://www.indiatoday.in/crime/story/honour-killing-pregnant-daughter-mumbai-1569847-2019-07-16

And HELL more on Google.

Edit: Honour killing my foot. The solution?

Literacy is probably the best way for now. Anything else? I have just one complain about your post - what makes you think it is only 'Indian parents'?

Conforming to 'society' is something almost all humans do, all Asians, all Africans, all Russians, Chinese, Pakis, Saudis, etc. Even religious and conservative societies in Europe and America have the same problem.

It's very simple. Our people are religious - Hindu, Muslim, communist, whatever. They are therefore conservative and anti-modern. And this promotes our sadistic old ancient cultures to exist. And this causes problems.

Remember, it is only by modern psychology and Science that we have understood about 'mental health'. For an average person in this world, unless they are living in a metropolitan world class city, these are nonsense and are 'against their culture'. Beating children, abusing them, etc is something that has been the norm for millennia in almost the entire world. Good parenting techniques, being conscious about mental health is a modern thing. People think their children are their property. And you can do what you see fit with your property. Couple that with a culture where there are very few support systems outside of the extended family structure, and you'll get tragedies. In today's edition of Divya Bhaskar (Gujarat) I read that in a Gujarati town a caste held some kind of awareness program/meeting to encourage arranged marriage only in their caste and, discourage love marriages and any marriages outside their caste.", alreadyteken abhoi funnybone91 kaladin_survivor bunnykumarxyz dant3s throwaaway14342169 a_bunch_of_neurons Suradoe MissionStatistician thesereneknight
Stalker problem,88,cavhus,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cavhus/stalker_problem/,54,1562672573.0,"21F here from Maharashtra. Created throwaway account for this.

A guy I was in a relationship with, who I hate for being a rapist, an abuser and absolute scumbag overall, has been trying to get in touch with me wanting to meet me. I blocked his number on WhatsApp and also his calls and messages. He tried to contact me last week on WhatsApp from another number which has disturbed me. he calls me every day (his calls get automatically blocked but I can see it in call history). He knows where I live. Currently, I am in another state because of my job. I don't want to call the cops on him because my parents might find out. I also absolutely don't want to contact him for some other reasons.

Is there any way I can get rid of him?",hatemystalker,AskIndia," I don't think your parents will have any problem if you do complaint, I guess you're afraid that you have to tell them the whole story but this is bigger than that. So please do reach out to a women's helpline atleast. Call a women's helpline. Do not wait till it becomes more dangerous. You need to contact women's helpline and fast. This idiot could be dangerous. Don't worry about parents. That would be much less painful than dealing with this bastard. You're an adult, police has no right to involve your parents in this. So you can go to them for help or womens helpline is even better. You can also tweet your plight on Twitter to Ministry¬†of¬†Women and Child Development and they'll get in touch with you themselves. Parents might find out Vs getting raped and murdered.. Hmm which one will I choose >I don't want to call the cops on him because my parents might find out.

This does not sound good Arjun reddy gaaru? OP, here is the best thing you can do without involving your parents:

Go with a female friend much older than you(could be a neighbor/boss/office colleague) to the police station(or women's police station) nearest you(the state you live in), produce the evidence and ask them to call him. Tell them you are disturbed, worried about physical attack etc. They will call him and give him a dire warning of the consequences which will make him back off for good. Police folks dont like things to escalate so they will appropriately warn him and make him cut the shit out.

If he is a tenacious bastard, he might pull the ""I was engaged to her, she is my girlfriend, etc..etc.."". Or may go to any lengths to involve your parents. My guess is he is not, because he hasnt threatened you of contacting your parents so far.

Still this is your best and most effective option. Go to the cops and report him ASAP. Don't take these things lightly. Talking to parents is the best choice for you. He has got your gut that you'll never tell parents and he can keep you harassing. 

I hope you'll have friends from work/living, you have to find one whom you can trust completely and he/she can talk to him and threaten him about going to cops. Never meet him alone. Seeing many times how things go with stalkers, I would suggest to take utmost precaution and if possible call women helpline or cops. Don't ignore as many times these types of people are even willing to hurt others in the name for so called ""love"".

He would never really go home because you were his only friends, but that did not stop him from threatening and throwing a tantrum. 

These politicians are just nostalgic about their past. Congress+JDS formed Govt to keep BJP out. BJP was desperate and was trying to make MLAs switch sides.

 They tapped into the MLA base who did not get ministries and got them to resign this time.

So numbers will favour BJP for Govt formation. Current Govt will fall by tomorrow. Mota Bhai is on a shopping spree There is an editorial piece about it in today's The Hindu. Give a read. These MLA's cannot defect to BJP because of the anti defection law, so they are resigning instead, this will eventually give BJP more seats allowing them to form the government. 

This type of horse trading is the worst and no other decent democracy would allow shit like this to happen. What a fucking joke. nothing to explain...it's the best example of worst politicians in India. Sad that we common citizens take elections so seriously to choose these idiots as our leaders.. Some Karnataka MLA's of Congress and JDS are fed up with Kumaraswamy and want to resign. Speaker being INC member decides to initiate disqualification against these MLA's without deciding on their resignations. MLA's who resign can contest bypolls and become ministers those who are disqualified cannot contest bypolls for the current session of the assembly.  So these MLA's want to join BJP and contest from BJP for the bypolls and speaker wants to fear them by disqualification to take back their resignations. Whatever may be the result the Congress and JDS government is in minority and is taking important decisions. [Why has this old video of comedian Jaspal Bhatti resurfaced?

That is a really obnoxious thing to say to somebody but as a nine year old I thought that's what rich people say and the neighborhood where I grew up in which is a little town in the Northeast, is full of gamblers, and unfortunately, my father was one.

My father worked in the department of agriculture but couldn't save none. When I was around 14 years old, my father sold our house for only five lakh rupees, my mother battled everyday, reached out to people to convince him not to but nobody helped and I didn't understand anything about it, neither did my elder sister who was 17 at the time.

He never encouraged us to study and the neighborhood didn't inspire it either and consequently we hardly cleared our matriculation. After that, no college for us.

It was around 2012 when I got my first cell phone which was a Chinese phone with a 2g network (took 40 mins or something to download a 4mb song), with that phone, I taught myself everything I know, I can safely say I learned from that phone more than what I learned in school. 

I started confronting my father when I turned 17 or something about what he did to us and he always said things like, ""I don't earn for you, I earn for myself"", ""when I die, you'll get enough money from the government to build a house and live happily"".

Which wasn't true. My father died back in 2017 and now we're told to leave the quarter. They let us live for two years but not anymore.

I was never forced to go out and work and with a 10 pass certificate, I'm not going to find any work either. Shit has hit the fan. We got some 15 lakh from the office and paid 2.5 lakh for some loan he had, now with that little budget we can't imagine building a house in this age, plus my sister is unmarried.

I love my mother so much, I loved my father as well despite what kind of a person he was, he was my father nevertheless. But my mother, she's my life. If it wasn't for my mother, i would've ended this life.

My relatives stopped calling us a year later my father's death lest we ask them for help.

It's just 3 of us now, nobody comes to our house anymore, my father's work colleagues who used to treat me like a son now passes me by like I'm some stranger.

Life is bleak with no hope in sight. I'm soon to be 24 with no prior experience in work. I've been told to move out of the town but i can't imagine living my mother and sister in a place where there's no one to take care of them.

I dream about 3 of us killing ourselves. I hope it doesn't come to pass.

My father never let me work, not even go to market and get groceries because he thought I'm a fool, i can't use money. I squandered my life away. I work in our locality but it's not work in the traditional sense, i just help out people for little to no money.

What can I do? I don't hope to make my mother proud, I just want a stable life and always be there for my mother.

My nearest city is Guwahati. There I might my some work but again, can't leave them here and I a city like Guwahati, where average rent is 10k+, all of us can't move there either.

How do I make thing work, how do I make myself work?

How do you go out and find work? I have no real world experience. I used to have a really good friend, thought he was my best friend but that's not true. He stopped hanging out with me.

I play ludo with my mother and sister to keep them distracted of our imminent dark days.

Help me..",pityfuckthrowaway,AskIndia," You sound too articulate to be in this situation. I'm even inclined to mark this as a fake. 

If this is genuine, my apologies. I think that any high-end hotel or resort would be interested in talking to you for hospitality services. Make a resume, upload it on naukri, monster, timesjob and all other job portals you know of. Apply for hospitality jobs which you find closest to your vicinity. If that doesn't work out DM me and I'll do what I can.
Don't give up hope, there always a way. Can you open up a small restaurant? Its something everyone in the family can pitch in with. The initial investment can be small if you start with a food stall rather than a restuarant. I am from Guwahati and I own a small hotel which I am currently expanding so I might need a few housekeeping boys in the next few months. 

Send me a pm about your details, like the name of the place where you stay because to be honest the way you have written the post it seems really fake and this is the internet after all. You have hardly provided any substantial info other than the fact that you are from NE.

You sound like a book reader because the way you have written your words and used phrases makes it feel like I am reading some creative writing stuff. The way you have you have punctuated, articulated your words, the grammar raises a lot of doubt.

In my opinion someone in need of such serious advice wont bother using such formal words and phrases found commonly in books but not so commonly in the internet where informal language is mostly used.

My apologizes for the skepticism so please hit me up with a pm if you are being serious, i'll try to get you some job/ give advice.

Edit- Read some comments down below, OP said that his first language is Assamese. If he replies to my comment or pm's me I'll be able to verify if his story is true or fake. You have been dealt a hard hand without any fault of yours, maybe it's time for your luck to change. You write very well, I suggest that you pour out your energy into writing a book. Maybe a novel about your father and your own life. Give it a go, until you are unemployed, spend a few months writing the first draft. If you need a writing companion for the initial days you can send me a PM and I'll work with you. If you are in a village go to the nearest school and tell the principal about your situation, many schools have good books. Ask the principal for some books that you can prepare for govt jobs. If there aren't any go to the nearest library or borrow them from any student. While preparing for those exams you can do part time jobs if you're interested. Many people drive cabs as a part time job and they can live with that money. I know its hard for you but suicide is not the answer. You speak & write English well.  You have access to a computer or phone .... no matter how bleak it looks, you are already ahead of 90% in the country.

\- Start networking amongst the people that you know.  Especially, if you know people that run their own business, ask if, you can go in and learn the trade.

\- Set up meetings with people, no one may give you a job, but everyone you know can probably give you some advice on how to find something.  Ask for help on how to fix up your resume.  Main thing is to get the word out that you are looking.

\- Ask for a modest pay.  If the job is interesting, and will look good on your skillset base, offer to work for a small living wage / reimbursement of direct expenses.

\- If you appear clean/present yourself well, look at the hospitality industry (Hotel/Restaurant etc).  Even if you dont want to leave the NE for say Bangalore etc... something should be possible.

\- For instance, if you know any travel agency, offer to take up their social media outreach... to generate bookings and then work on a commission etc.

\- If you have an aptitude for programming, lots of online free resources, but that takes drive.

\- If you are going through a bad patch, it can be difficult to motivate yourself... but do it for your sister/mom.  After all, you care enough to not want to move away from them.  Also, make sure your sister is doing the right things in terms of accumulating skillsets.

\- Conserve your capital, take the 15L, put it in a bank FD, while the income is near nothing.... find a way to make it work.  At least do that for a year or two. Brother your English is genuinely way too good for someone who claims that he is 10th pass. If you really are in that deep shit that you have little to no income, move out.

I don't know why you are holding out on that, if your father didn't let you go to work for so many years why didn't you do anything before? Stop blaming your father. 16 to 23 is 7 years that you didn't do anything in life? You didn't feel like finishing up 12th grade or working at all? Your story doesn't add up but you gotta move to a metropolitan. You need some form of opportunity that people would give to someone who speaks good English but hasn't passed 12th grade and it's not possible in small towns. 

Go to the city, apply for jobs EVERYWHERE. Apply in every BPO and in the service industry. If they ask for a degree, just send an email to HR stating that you would be perfect for the job even though you don't have a job and they should give you an interview. 

See I don't know your skillset because you didn't talk about it all. But if there is anything else except good English then leverage it. Apply to anything related, like English tutors, Receptionist at a company or even a simple attendant at some place. 

Your quality of life will decrease but that will happen for a bit till you develop your skill set and move up the work experience ladder.

Your story sounds fake but I will give you the benefit of doubt. 

best of luck If you barely kept up with school then how come you're so well versed in English? Hindi I'd understand but English? Did the 2G phone teach you everything or what. Seems like a false story. Forgive me in case this is true. Hi dude, I am also from your place (Assam) and I am kinda biased to believe your story to be true. First, I am happy about 2 things:

1.	That you‚Äôve realised that shit has hit the fan, &
2.	Age is on your side

Which make things easier.
How: as many have pointed out, you can probably move in to the nearest big city Guwahati, preferably alone, to find some job, preferably in the hospitality sector.

A.	I know, you haven‚Äôt ever lived alone, but you need to man up for this. Thinking about your Mom and sister, thereby worrying and crying can wait for the night. During the day, you need to hustle.

B.	Keep a significant amount of your dad‚Äôs savings for the rainy day. Allocate yourself maybe only a few thousands for the time you struggle till finding a job.

C.	Don‚Äôt only try for the premium hospitality in Guwahati. I mean don‚Äôt only go for Radissons and Vivantas. Try for the likes of OYOs as well. If you need help in introduction, I can help you here.

D.	Tutoring kids may not be a success for you as not many parents would send their kids to you. Because on paper, you‚Äôre only a 10th pass and people are biased. However, you can work for professions which require translators, maybe from Assamese to English/Hindi to English. Small time jobs, e.g., near Kachari (Courthouse) area may be available.

E.	Take care of your security as well; after all, like most cities, Guwahati is assholic and if people get to know you‚Äôve money on you (howsoever little), things can go crazy. Best is to identify at least someone, even if remotely related, to help you out during the initial days.

F.	Think like an entrepreneur: ‚ÄúNothing is beneath dignity‚Äù, as long as it‚Äôs not illegal/immoral. Take up any job (for sustenance), until you find a regular source of income. Think of your life as your start-up, which you will have to make successful.

G.	People/friends/family will laugh at you when you lead such vagabond/struggler life in a city. Let them do, it‚Äôs their job. Feel the resent but please don‚Äôt react. And also remember that it‚Äôs okay to cry or feel depressed sometime. When you finally become self-sustainable, you will cherish these moments, trust me. Call your Mom/sister whenever possible, tell them you‚Äôre doing fine. Take care of their health and well-being like a good son.

H.	PLEASE DON‚ÄôT STOP LEARNING. Through 2G/3G/4G, whichever way.

If you still feel that you need to talk to someone during the bad days, you can always PM me, I can be a good sounding board. And also help wherever I can. Like many have pointed out, you write pretty well. You should apply for content writing jobs, these can be done remotely! You can get paid anywhere between 1K to 5K per article depending on what you're writing about.

In order to build profile initially I suggest you start writing about stuff on medium or quora. So you have something to show when you apply for these jobs.

[AskIndia] Is it just me or are most of the gym trainers across our nation unqualified?,427,bxsezi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bxsezi/askindia_is_it_just_me_or_are_most_of_the_gym/,198,1559927610.0,"What's your experience?
Here are the things I've heard gym trainers say in a couple of cities in India (translated).

""You won't gain weight now. It's summer, you will sweat too much to gain weight.""

""You don't need to do warm-ups dude. Just lift."" (This guy came three weeks later with his shoulder in a sling. Kya hua? Dislocate ho gaya)

""You *have* to do 15 reps, everything else is wrong. 3 sets of 6? How will the muscle get stimulated?""

""Compound exercises are for 'fitness'. Isolation exercises are for muscle building.""

""Optimum Nutrition? *ON*?? Koi local brand hoga..""

""Don't listen to doctors. Doctors themselves come to my gym."" (said by the same guy who said don't warm up).

**EDIT**: BONUS:
""Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

EDIT2: Yes, The Bonus actually isn't bad. There's an argument for it. But I'll leave it here, as a testament to my own fallibility. And because ""phaavda leke.. "" sounds badass.",MauryanEmperor,AskIndia," I've trained for 5.5 years in NCR, hopping gyms every 6-12 months. I've been to some cheap gyms (INR 800/month) and been to some relatively expensive chains (bomiso, anytime fitness) and one thing is pretty common - the trainers all suck.   


In fact, in my experience, the most knowledgeable gym trainer I've met was at the cheapest gym - he owned the gym, and was running it in the basement of an actual residence.   


Here's how I've learnt to deal with the pseudo-trainers:   
1. Make them know their place: They're there to help you *if and only if you ask for help.* You've paid for the membership, which means you can use the equipment. You're under no obligation to listen to 'trainers'.   
2. Be courteous, but distant with them. Say ""I have my routine, I'm doing this."" Many trainers will just leave you alone, thinking you already have another plan, or know more than them (which is actually very probable)  
3. Follow your routine to a T, so you can impress the same guys with your results, in silence.   


Best of luck! I've been going gym since 2008 and have trained quite a lot of people for free, I can confirm that majority of trainers don't even know the names and proper form of exercise. Let alone talking about compound and isolation exercises. Gyms don't have a degree requirement so every gym bro or even a newbie can apply to become a trainer and then keep fucking up everyone else body. That's just exercise. Most of the people don't even know about nutrition and stuff. They will just point you to the nearest supplement counter. The deadlift one is actually correct. It's called a mixed grip, it improves stability and prevents the barbell from slipping. You need to alternate your underhand and overhand when using mixed grip so that you don't develop muscle imbalance. I got lucky when I started going to gym where there was a trainer in his 40s who knew almost everything there is about fitness that was in 2010. And now in Bangalore these trainers literally doesn't even know to teach pushups in correct form. Be careful when you choose to join a gym. Any should or knee joint issues will affect you throughout your life. ""It's damn hot, can you turn on the AC?""  

""It's good if it's hot, you'll sweat more so become thinner.""  

WTF.png Dude ,I have been lifting for 3 years and have even helped my friends in transformation,till now I have not seen a single trainer or even a competitor who knows his shit. I have even trained with Mr.UP and he doesn't know shit about training. These people are complete jackass . Most of these guys use PEDs told to them by some trainer and then suffer. You can check tarun Gill's channel on YouTube and not even 1 competitor knew his shit,1 of them was telling to stop bathing before competition. [deleted] I've been to 3 gyms in Bangalore including cult fitness and yes the trainers don't know shit. I would have got tendinitis if I continues with the cult fitness class. To be honest most of our workforce except the creamy layer need to be trained and retrained. This is the pain which comes with a growing nation. For instance, try looking for a handyman who is competent. It's really hard, or they are already working for a big company. The money they get from the jobs is also not so high so they don't put their heart and soul into this so they can make things better. Hopefully with growth of economy our country's workforce skills also grow up I used to go to a gym for a while (2014-15) and one of the trainers straight up told me to take some steroids cause I'm too skinny.

 [https://www.youtube.com/ButWhy](https://www.youtube.com/ButWhy) A tamil channel called ‚ÄòLets make Engineering simple‚Äô is doing a good job.    
They tend to involve in applying rational logic and also made some videos to bust myths/scams
   
https://www.youtube.com/user/premanand20081 Education category is a vague term. 

Indian youtube channels in terms of academics (teaching the course materials like they are taught in class) are very good. Many students within India and even in other countries in Europe and USA rely on Tutorials uploaded by Indian channels. 

[Gate Lectures by Ravindra Babu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjC1hn78yZqTf0vdTC6wAQ) is the video Bible for any CS student.

[Neso Academy](https://www.youtube.com/user/nesoacademy) is another respected channel in Electronics field.

However, if you mean stuff like uploading 5-10 minute videos on one extremely specific topic with good animations like in Veritasium etc. I think it would take some time before we do that. Good animations aren't cheap and we have a ""Chalta hai"" attitude that would rather explain stuff on pen and paper or whiteboard rather than spending time on making stuff on computer. Indians are still less tech literate than an average American. Cancur Hindustani bhau I know a couple of really good ones I follow but in Tamil.

[Let's make engineering simple](https://www.youtube.com/user/premanand20081) - science stuff but it's in Tamil (pretty big channel this)

What is your opinion on legalisation of weed/marijuana,54,c5ldhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c5ldhq/what_is_your_opinion_on_legalisation_of/,142,1561553449.0,"Weed is a more healthier alternative to alcohol and smoking,and has helped several people get over the idea of suicide due to depression and other conditions.
Weed is also used as a legal medication for bearing the pain of cancer
Weed was legal in India untill recently with pressure from US to ban it.The irony is that weed is legal in USA now.what are your thoughts?",Squash3000,AskIndia," They should atleast start legalizing it for medical research. Legalize it and decriminalize it. Create an industry around it which will create Jobs and also help in generating revenues. Many states in the US are already doing it. My opinion on the matter is that India should be able to decide for itself what is good and what is bad. Marilize Legalijauna!  


People are already doing it and it is not proven to be any more harmful than alcohol is to the body. Plus it has many medicinal benefits which tobacco and alcohol don't. It is being smuggled and there is a huge black market for it. A legal industry will make sure another steady source of revenue is added to govt's coffers. Colorado the first state to allow sale of recreational marijuana brought in a huuuuge $1 billion in revenue. Do whatever you want as long as you don't cause harm to others We need to talk about this then.we protest when we want a change not roll over Liquor lobby will never make it happen.

And the Govt. wont do it, because how can they legalize a 'narcotics' substance. The money pouring in from the liquor lobby just makes it a win-win case for the Govt. Yaar I don't know what's the point in even discussing about this when we know that weed won't be leaglized in our lifetime. It's good for the economy. Will lead to the creation of a prodigious industry. Supposedly has medical benefits. 

&#x200B;

But, I've noticed that the people I know who're into the weed culture, the Boom-Shankar-Bawa types and even people who just use it in a recreational without the theatrics develop a complacent attitude which is frustrating for those around them. This is a good discussion thread:

And I can't speak about this to my parents. On the other hand, getting a job with good money is a surity for me. Still, I'm unhappy and badly want out. life is treating as if i am its sole enemy.  
have this large tumor in my head that doctors say is non cancerous.keep coughing all day, like an old hag, even in these hot summer days.  
have lost all friends ,used to be a bright kid ,but now everything seems useless,parents think i am a burden , they even compare 5-6 year olds against  me like that kid listens to their parents and what not.Dating , huh , whats that?

sometimes i just  wish that a doctor reports that i have cancer and i could die in peace and sometimes i wish that i live and be sooo successful that i can chose with whom i want to spend my time with and what pleasures i want in my life and prove some people wrong. I am stuck, I don't want to do a job but I cannot live off my parent's either. I have given up on dating, and relationships. Life sucks. College is awful and I on my own didn't take any great initiative to make something of myself. Life isn't what it was supposed to be really. Studied my ass off in 11-12th but it didn't amount to anything in the end. Walked into my shitty college as an enthusiastic 17 year old and it didn't take more than a week for me to get utterly disappointed with the teachers and the people around me. Its like all hope and motivation has been sucked out of me. Studying abroad seems like the only good option but really with my profile, grades and whatnot it's nothing but a distant dream. All I have done in college uptil now is get fat, drink, picking up smoking and binge tv shows. Dating has been out of the equation for me for a while now. Worst of all is seeing my cousins living their dream lives and here I am marinating in my self loathing and patheticness. I don't really fit anywhere either. I have friends but I don't feel like I connect well with any of them. It's just an attempt by me to not be lonely. I don't really fit in with any of my family either, I don't like interacting with them and it seems they don't either. Genetics fucked me hard too, making me the worst looking person in my family, prone to acne, gaining weight easily, being short af and tonnes of other shit. Many people would say I have it easier compared to so many others but that doesn't make anything better for me. I'm too pathetic to be alive really and I feel like it's about time to end it. My parents don't deserve a kid like me and after a while they will get used to having only one kid. The happiest I've been was in my preteen years and ever since then life has been one hard, sluggish experience. I've been telling myself - 'Just need to be done with school after that I'll meet new people and life will be good' or 'after 12th college will be amazing, I'll make friends for life and whatnot', but now it's almost been a decade of me trying to get through the tough part but maybe I need to face it that there isn't any good part left for me. 20 years old.

Better off working a 9 to 5 desk job unless game design is your only passion. I can't comment on console gaming but mobile gaming is huge, if you are passionate and you can make casual/hyper casual games then you can find publishers waiting to buy/publish your games.

I hate everything... 

Sorry for the rant",sum1spcl,AskIndia," Well you sound like you desperately need a vacation to get your head sorted. Try to take 2 weeks off before quitting to come up with atleast a small plan to see what you want to do? That‚Äôs the only suggestion that I can give. So, I'll tell you how it all works out. 
I am no MBA neither am I some IIT. But I quit my decent paying job, moved back home first and eventually phased out of my job.

I just get about 10k coz in my free time I help dad manage some shit.

I was actively working on starting something of my own been about 40 months and nothing has yet worked out. I read a lot but that too has fizzled out coz now I am bored of books or frustrated in general and now I am more focused to getting back to earning.

I want to travel but that hasn't worked great 10k a month is insufficient for the entire month. 
So I went for a trek to Utharakhand. I paid 4500 in flight tickets to Delhi, train was about 900 I guess and 3500 for the trip. Stay was with friends and food was taken care. So saved there.

I planned a Hampi trip, it's supposed to be a cheap vacation from the place I live. But then j have other important expenses, like my health Insurance. I didn't have it until last year and then I got admitted into a hospital for 3 days and ended up paying more than a lakh.

My mom's root canal cost me 12k, You'll have to ensure your teeth are proper. Those buggers are a money sink.

You getting the idea?

Assuming you living in your home town. Now let's see you'll have friends and they'll surely want you to chill with them, they will be earning - once in a while you will have to go out with them, obviously don't want to end up alone coz you pinch money. One outing will set you back about 2k if you drink in my city. 

These are expenses and lifestyle you don't imagine and I considered it easy.

Do not. You have expenses, you have bills. You need a good passive income to sail you through. 
Again it'll be a call you'll have to take, lifestyle same rakhna hai ya scale down karna hai. 

For a similar lifestyle - I need about 15k a month to survive. But this is no savings. This is bills, travel and basic comfort.

Oh ya, your parents are getting old, so those expenses are something you need to keep in mind too. Even if they have saved some for themselves, as an Indian I am assuming, you'll be there and take responsibility.

What's the trade you need to make and how far can you go with a discipline? > DAE want to not work in a soul sucking job and just chill out and do things you enjoy?

That's what 90% of humanity dreams of bro Don't quit without a plan.

The least you can do is calculate how far your savings will last you, should you quit. After that, make a detailed plan on how to stretch your savings. Finally, as someone else commented, try picking up some freelance work on the internet or IRL to set up a network/fallback. If you can't find freelance work, it probably means you'll have to live solely on your savings...

Oh, and be absolutely sure that you can land a job again after a sabbatical - most industries choose to hire young 'uns because they are cheap and abundant. So, pretty soon you might find yourself too old or too expensive or both. You may not want to go back to a job but if things don't go right, you might just need to, so make sure that avenue remains open.

Source: Currently on a sabbatical. This is how I did it. I did it out of the blue in 2006. I just wanted to do my own thing. Had no idea what to do. Job is not something you are supposed to enjoy. That's why you get paid for doing it. If it was something you enjoyed, you would be paying to do it. You do your job from Monday to Friday, make money & then use that money to pursue your hobbies (read/write/travel) during weekends, holidays and vacations. 

There is a lot of stuff between like & hate. So try to get a job you don't hate (you don't necessarily need to love it) & use the money to pursue your hobbies. You should generate some passive income, start an online business. Selling products on Amazon. If you can do an investment of 50k and buy products from Suppliers, like Alibaba, etc, you might generate a passive income. You can do a research on that topic. Options are unlimited you just have to find them. I can identify with OP.  Hated corporate life, the politics, fake courtesy, blame games and shit..

Probably I am not fit for a corporate setup

Did leave my IT job a year ago to get a career change and now here I am seriously contemplating ways to kill myself..Unfortunately, you need to be lucky to die early

I hope you don't face the same if you decide to take the leap.. Travelling takes toll on one's body also it isn't as galmours or enjoyable as people make it seems. A man without a plan won't survive much would not recommend. I was in your place a few years ago. A little older, lesser LPA, more in bank. Headed north and stayed with a friend, planned to head further north to volunteer. Friend convinced me that was not what I wanted, plus had an epiphany over more rounds of beers than usual. Dropped the plan, got back in the grind, realized it is not time to give up just yet.

If the anecdote avove doesn't help, get and read the book Vagabonding by Rolf Potts. While I would've loved a life on the road, that life without purpose would have bored the fuck out of me in months, in not years. God, things would have been different, worlds apart even, but I'm happy and content now. To be frank, almost everyone hates their job and want to leave it and instead travel and enjoy their life, but only a few are able to do so due to various factors. 

I agree with the top comment. First take two weeks leave and then plan how you want to do it. 

For the money part, how much have you saved till now? Do you have any loans? Better invest your savings in 1)Gilt funds and 2) Overnight funds to get better returns than FD and Savings account respectively.", akapaynn kadesi kaka4pres2020 rjshrikant braindead_in RisingSteam nyk_shubham dp003 PM_ME_HAPPYSMILES singapuri_kela poco_gamer
Going to Andaman this October. Any advice?,48,cagxzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cagxzv/going_to_andaman_this_october_any_advice/,58,1562592149.0,Not about hotels. Those things are done. I'm talking about sightseeing or anything special to do.,TheUnfaithfulUser,AskIndia," * You can go see the Jail, in Port Blair. There's a light and sound show. 
* If you like history then the State Library in Port Blair has all kinds of amazing old documents. It's a public library, so you can go look around (atleast, I did, some years ago). 
* If you eat seafood, then you will get great fresh fish. 
* beaches, obviously. 
* There's beautiful coral reefs in and around Andaman - you can go snorkeling or you can get one of those boats with a see-through base to see them. 
* There's a beautiful and creepy place called Ross Island, where all the old structures have been overtaken by climbers and trailers. Its worth seeing - you have to take a short ferry ride from Port Blair 


Two things I would request you NOT to do: 

* A lot of companies run tours around the tribal areas. Please don't give them your money without doing research first. Many of them treat the local indigenous residents like monkeys in a zoo. It's horrible. You have people throwing food at them, asking them to dance before they are given food/money, taking videos without consent. Before you sign up for a tour try and ask so you know if your tour company is doing creepy shit like this, because you may not realise it, but once you go there and they start doing this, you may be stuck in an awkward situation. 

* I know its tempting, but if you see pieces of coral on the beach/in the sea, don't pick them up and take them home. Those old coral pieces form a part of the marine ecosystem there and removing certain varieties is actually illegal. Many people don't know this and take them home (like one would collect sea shells) without intending to cause harm. Admire their beauty and leave them where they are. 

I've visited the Andamans several times, and these are the two mistakes I see people make often! [deleted] Skip Port Blair. Stay in Havelock and go scuba diving. * I didnt get cell service above 2g

* Visit Havelock Island Radha Nagar Beach and take time to relax there

* Do snorkeling or sea walk in elephant beach

* Visit Ross island

* Book ferries as soon as possible because they tend to run out

* Cellular Jail is a good place but i wouldnt recommend the night light show

* Baratang Island has the limestone cave but the tour is mainly focused on the journey through the forest inhabited by the jarawa people. This takes a whole day

* Chidiya Tapu has a beautiful big zoo/ sanctuary kind of thing also it has a small beach which is a sunset point.

* Red skin island is a small beautiful island with a shallow beach and rich corals for snorkeling.Its open for 6 months. The other 6 months Jolly Buoy Island is open which i havent visited.

* Also people tell good things about Neil Island but i havent been there.


Andaman is a very beautiful place. Definitely one of the most beautiful places. Visit North Sentinel Island Carry a BSNL SIM card. Carry (multiple) printouts of tickets and any other documents that you might need. Go to Havelock in the early days of your trip, i had to miss my flight back because we got stuck on Havelock due to stormy weather. If possible, travel to Nicobar too. I missed it due to fever, but its a unique beauty you will unlikely find in India. I think you will need a permit from the Navy though. I got it, but missed my boat due to fever. Network coverage is poor and pos machines dont work most of the time so carry cash with you October: isn't that peak rainy season in  monsoon there ? I loved the Jail & Ross Island. I'm kind of attached to histories so yeah I was mesmerized in Ross Island.

Why do Indian drivers honk all the time ?,108,c64l02,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c64l02/why_do_indian_drivers_honk_all_the_time/,79,1561665134.0,"I just returned from Chennai and was confused that everyone who is driving let it be a motorbike, riksha, bus, or car  is always honking all the time? 

Why  ? 

Please enlighten me.",DifficultCharacter,AskIndia," I don‚Äôt know why people in other places do it but in Delhi, if you don‚Äôt honk like crazy, other people on the road, those who are driving and those who are walking, think it‚Äôs their birthright to turn wherever the hell they want. No indication, no slowing down, no looking left or right. The main reason would be to alert other drivers to their presence. In most places drivers stick to the lanes they drive in. So you would check your side mirrors for any overtaking vehicles. In India since no one really sticks to lanes, and vehicles are constantly shifting side to side, you need a way of letting other vehicles know that you are passing by without running the risk of them hitting you.

That and the absolute chaos (which I think works in some way) keeps everyone in a permanently agitated state and any minor thing can set you off leading to an angry honk. Sir sometimes you just feel... horney. In Chennai people honk because :
Dei, I'm going to overtake you beware 
Dei , go to left / right 
Dei , walk in the corner of the road and not on the middle
Dei , why are you driving so slow in an empty road Ehhh.. we just like to watch the world burn Coz everyone on the road believes that it is empty and they can turn, stop, swerve whenever they want. That's why me make it a point to honk, especially when two wheelers are around. It is an expression of joy. Just happy to be with everyone in middle of traffic. They paid for the horn, so they might as well use it! 1. There are rules. If you follow them, the fact that there are so many who don't grays the line. 

2. Horn is the only fucking way you get these brutes to look at their mirrors (Hi Auto Rickshaws)

3. Sooner or later when someone honks at you it's almost involuntary that you understand the problem Impatience, entitlement and muscle memory Honking is the only way to survive in Indian roads ffs . Is everyone here just so much disconnected from real India or everyone is from US and other countries . In heavy traffic and while crossing junction you never know who may take a turn where honking helps to make others aware of your presence .", BiaatchAndAHalf SheikY09 hydrosalad Saichander normalguy5599 Baldie02 aryaxsg hgoenka oi_piglet plshelpthedog opressedeldian7060
Is it just my parents or do Indian parents really like to analyze what their kids do?,63,ccmo2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccmo2c/is_it_just_my_parents_or_do_indian_parents_really/,32,1563032025.0,"Like literally, my parents analyze me in whatever I am doing be it when I am talking with my friends when they are around, how I do things and stuff which really tilts me to the core because they don‚Äôt even kind of make it discrete.

Also on a side note they are like really overprotective. They will literally call me(quite a few times if I don‚Äôt receive it) anytime I go out to ask if I reached/left from the place. I don‚Äôt even live in India, I live in Singapore and it‚Äôs one of the safest cities in the world so safety probably isn‚Äôt an issue.

Is it just me? Or does this also happen to others?",Iamrandom17,AskIndia," Relax .. you seem ‡§á‡§ï‡§≤‡•å‡§§‡§æ Maybe they're trying to figure out who you are as a person because you're not as close to them as they want you to be? You're their creation, so you're their number one interest in their lives.

I face the same, and I have realized this. The thing is I prefer to communicate in English so I don't connect with people as well in my mother tongue, so I'm not as free when talking to my parents. I'm a totally different person with my friends though.

And yeah, they have been pretty overprotective of me in the past. But now I'm starting to show responsibility so they trust me more now. All parents are protective.

But if you feel they are overprotecting you, the reason may be that you are the only child and the care about you. Happens a lot. You gotta learn how to tune it out. The thing with most Indian parents is that they don't have any hobbies outside of their regular work. Then, who becomes their subject of interest? Their kids. We are their projects. They want to make us copies of themselves and they live vicariously through us. 

They also don't have a concept of privacy. Plus, they don't understand that when the kids grow up, the kids and them have their own lives too.

They make their kids their lives and complain when the kids can't live up to their expectations.

/Rant. As a parent, it's interesting to see all these rant-on-parent threads. As for your question, I don't think Indians analyze or worry any more than other Asian parents. Since we are an overpopulated country and low level (think super market/fast food/petrol pump) jobs pay very less, we all tend to worry more about kid's futures than our western counterparts. If ur parents are very overprotective, you probably are a single child. Talk to them about ur need for freedom and privacy. You are like an FD that person goes to bank to see and has nothing to do with it. Just to see that it's there. /s These NRI kids I tell you all over protected. I see all my friends mollycoddle their kids. 

And these guys have received chappal, the hot spoon & spanking treatment & have gone onto the totally other side - over protective & super tiger moms& dads!

So just chillax, don‚Äôt worry about them. You‚Äôre lucky your parents care about you enough to analyze you & try to understand you. 

This is also a good lesson when you grow up & become your own person, the world will try & analyze you & talk about you behind your back. 

If you‚Äôve been trained on it since childhood, you know how to handle that shit. 

Thank your parents for this massive life lesson. It's always good to get multiple perspectives on cultural issues like this. Have you asked this question in the SG sub? It would be interesting to see the responses you get there and see how they differ from the ones here. It'll help you to make a more informed decision that combines understanding where your folks come from but also figuring this out with people in the society you actually live in. In other words, Indians kids that live in India might not be able to help you reach the answer you're looking for. Maybe they have trust issues. What did you do to break their trust?

Especially the partition, from an angle you can look at my scalp. There is no history of baldness in my family, My grandfather died with a head full of hair. I've never taken care of my hair, no oil, very irregular shampooing. I want your help. What do you do? What shampoo and oild do you use?",RaevanBlackfyre,AskIndia," I use Panasonic basic trimmer. And level zero on the trimmer setting.   
Never used a comb, hair oil, conditioner in the last 15 years.  
   
It's also aerodynamically more efficient. Die fast so that you can die with a head full of hair. Oh, here is what I did. 

For the 27 years of my life, I had never cared for my hair. Eventually, they were a mess and full of dandruff. With the alarming amount of hair falling coupled with the fear of going bald - I went for a hair spa. 

Here are the pointers which worked for me: 

1) Be very, very picky with your shampoo. Pick the one which you hair requires - consult a doctor or a good saloon for this information. They have enough experience and will tell you good shampoos. Also, pick out a conditioner the same way. Once you have done that, use it as per the directions. 

2) Now that you have chosen your shampoo + conditioner, don't go over board with its use. Shampoos drain your scalp of all the natural oils and minerals which is not good for the health of your hair. You might have to use it a bit more often initially, but once your hair are in good shape, bring it down to once a week or twice a week. NEVER USE SOAP TO WASH YOUR HAIR.

3) Oiling - oiling is not necessarily required. I only oil the night before I plan to shampoo my hair. A good hair massage with almond oil and wash it all off the next day. 

If your hair is already in a bad state or you have dandruff, it won't hurt to go get a hair spa. You might even need 3-4 sittings to get them to a level where they can be managed by a normal shampoo + conditioner routine. Spend some money, your hair are worth it and they would affect your confidence if life way too much. Hairloss happens from the maternal side, not from the paternal. At least that's what my trichologist said.

The advice he gave me was to eat good, healthy food - especially a lot of greens. Plus, Minoxidil.

Honestly, best bet is to visit a doc. It's not very expensive and he'll be able to guide you the best. Have you heard of GHK-Cu?


It is available in Amazon.


Make a serum out of it, trim your hair or get a buzz cut and then apply it to your scalp.


Most people who use this reverse hair loss.

Other than that, don't take showers using hard water, improve your diet, go for a blood test to check your hormone levels and vitamin levels, include biotin in your diet and reduce stress, by whatever means. (meditation, yoga, mindfulness etc)

Quit vasoconstrictors like nicotine.

If possible visit a trichologist. Vitamin D3 supplement might help a lot. 

Unless the cause is genetic, you can take care by having proper diet, sleep, and hydration.

Shampoo when your hair is about to get dirty. 

Massage your head once every week with coconut oil.

Biotin won't help unless you're a rare kind of idiot with extremely shitty diet.

DIET, DIET, DIET.

Tocotrienols (Vitamin E) can also help. Some people respond to MSM as well. Check your ferritin, zinc, and D3 levels and supplement accordingly.

Final measures:

Minoxidil. Finasteride. Dutasteride. Dermarolling.

Take care of Dandruff and dry scalp my man. Lol here i am a sikh dude thinking how to shed my hair length. Get the undercut. Use biotin 10mg. That shit works wonders! Go bald like I did. No more hair for you to worry about Himalaya Anti hairfall Shampoo

Amazon.

But if you buy directly from the manufacturer site you'll get better support+new products. In India, Hp, Dell(limited products), Lenovo have their own online stores. Dude, no need to go for 1 TB HDDs. Go for 256 or 512 GB SSDs only instead. Night & day difference in overall PC speed. Why are you going for the older 504 series ?

This 505 one gets you 3rd gen ryzen, gtx 1650 and 512 gb SSD along with a 120Hz panel a whole lot better than the FX504GM-E4392T.  
All the ones you listed are 504 which has been replaced already.  

For the intel side : https://www.amazon.in/HP-Pavilion-15-bc514TX-15-6-inch-i7-9750H/dp/B07SC222TL/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=i7+9th+gen+laptop&qid=1563108731&s=gateway&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1  

Intel is already releasing 10th Gen CPUs soon, so either wait for it for a few months or go for current 9th gen i7, avoid 8th gen.  

Also avoid HDDs and GTX 1050 series and go for 512/256 SSD and GTX 1650.  
For processors stay on Ryzen 3rd gen or Intel 9th Gen.  
The above 2 i listed are pretty good. 9th gen i3-i7 don‚Äôt support multi-threading so beware. Offline stores will generally have newer models (ones that are not even listed on the company website). Stores have access to some extended catalogue which also has detailed specs like the % of sRGB colour gamut of the display, brightness in nits, etc. At the same time stores don't have older models as they order only when someone wants to buy that model. dude, you should build a custom CPU with help if necessary. You can decide the specs of your rig and buy the CPU parts according to your budget. Desktop pcs are also way cheaper yet more powerful than laptops. Buy a budget gaming laptop later if you really want to game on the go. Most these low end gaming laptop thermal throttle all the time even if you turn on ac. For that price you can easily assemble a desktop with r5-3600+ rtx2070, the freebie amd stock cooler out cool those single copper pipe + 1 mini fan laptops.

Do you guys have any experience with this?,happyvirus1235,AskIndia," All MLM are scams Long answer: yes

Short answer: ya Yes it's a scam but has managed to survive despite intense scrutiny. There's a great documentary about Herbalife on Netflix 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-jrALajXrI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-jrALajXrI)

&#x200B;

Bill Ackman had a billon dollar short on Herbalife and tried really hard to take them down - tried. Post this in r/MLM too It's name is so MLM. Get away from your friends who are pushing these schemes onto you. If you care about them tell them these MLM will rob them off their money as well as friendships. Yes, so is Amway and others. Don't go for it unless you are very sure of being able to find other bakras who can register under you so that you can get commission from their sales. It works for few, a colleague had quit his job and earns good money via mlm, but many others have lost their money,time and friends. Even health-wise, it's no better than cheaper substitutes. If you are only drinking protein drink and not eating anything else, you will lose weight without Herbalife. Just that people tend to stick to diet only when they paid lots of money. There was a big thing with investors bill ackman and Carl icahn where Bill show that herbalife was a scam but lost money anyway coz the company was profitable even though it is evil.

So no. Try to help your friends but ultimately distance yourself from them. And save all the communications you have with them in case they accuse you of stealing their money. Prevention is better than cure. /r/antimlm Stay away from Herbalife. Complete scum.

https://youtu.be/s6MwGeOm8iI Yes it is a scam . Check out r/antimlm too. it's a big scam, a Ponzi scheme and every other antimlm term you can find on the internet.       
They front as a healthy life business, but it's not. it's just to pull you in and trap you.            
and I call it a trap because that's how people even get interested in all this, it all seems very attractive and life changing even, but it'll take your life down hard.

American Accents,52,cbxi47,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cbxi47/american_accents/,37,1562890375.0,"So I'm putting together a math youtube channel and since our schools are off for Summer break I was going to invest some money advertising in the India market.  I do however have a strong Philadelphia accent, which is similar to New York, so my question is will students in India find my speaking hard to understand?",thegoatteachesmath,AskIndia," I don't think accent will be a problem, Indians follow a lot of American YouTubers, but it's hard to tell without listening. You can add subtitles/captions with a little bit of extra effort if you care that much. If you sound like Bernie Sanders , you should be fine. Indian ears are much more accustomed to varieties of accent from a young age. Unless you have a really hard to understand accent, it will be fine. Also, you can always put subtitles if you want. Cheers and all the best! Add subtitles You know, there are actually a lot of American Youtube movie reviewers (like Jaby Koay) who have, as of the past few years, started doing Indian movie reviews - presumably to expand their base and hit the Indian market as well.  And for the most part, they retain their regular speaking patterns and Indians seem to understand them fine, looking at the comments sections of their videos.

But math is a bit different because you are trying to teach them concepts and logic; it's more than just conversational English.  By and large I think you will be just fine, but if you are worried then I think if you try speaking a bit slower and try to enunciate more, then no matter what your accent it will probably sound more clear to foreigners. I watch a lot of movies/TV series and YouTube in different accents and it's rarely a problem unless a Japanese or Chinese person speaks in English.

A sample of your accent would help better to answer your question. I don‚Äôt think Indians can even differentiate between Philadelphia accent and a New York accent. Just took a look at your channel, and yes, you do have a noticeable accent, and whether it's understandable depends on the kind of audience you're targeting. Most Indians wouldn't even be able to tell the different accents apart, it all sounds the same to them. Lets just say your target population would be educated enough to understand your English.

Suggestions for Indian music that isn't from popular films?,16,cdiq8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdiq8e/suggestions_for_indian_music_that_isnt_from/,41,1563232660.0,"Hey /r/india! 

ABD (i don't consider myself confused), I'm looking for interesting Indian music that isn't from popular films. I would make exceptions for music from films that is particularly interesting or different, not your standard dance numbers or romantic songs. 

&nbsp;

I was recently listening to the Dil Se soundtrack and found it really interesting, dynamic and quite different from your average bollywood movie! The music is not standard and even the production is not standard, there's a lot of dynamism in the tracks. For example, in Satarangi Re it starts off with that high pitch vocal singing and then suddenly breaks into the beat. I found it really great. 

&nbsp;

Anyways, I also would love to find Indian music that isn't from movies. Like, is there a vibrant musician scene in India that isn't what we get internationally? Any hidden bands you really like that wouldn't have a chance to be marketed abroad? I'd also be interested in folk recordings. I'm not particularly interested in Classical music because those are quite easy to find and plentiful. 


&nbsp;

Things I'm not looking for:

* Dance beat songs
* autotuned vocals
* highly repetitive lyrics

&nbsp;

Are there any lucid dreamers in india? Do you guys have a community or something? I want in!,55,c9dzj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9dzj4/are_there_any_lucid_dreamers_in_india_do_you_guys/,46,1562347782.0,"I had my longest lucid dream today.

I woke up around 5 am to drink water and then fell asleep again. I think i was dreaming for around 3 hours, maybe more than that and finally woke up at 9 am. 

Dream: I was in my 8th standard school the whole time. Perfectly knew the whole time that i was in a dream and i am now 24. Kept telling school friends it is just a dream. I kept my calm and was very aggressive towards all the teachers. Was a good dream. 

I have lucid dreams frequently, around 1 every week. I want to take it to the next level and want to research more on this. I will be doing MBA next year and i and want to make a project on this. I currently own a guest house and i am very obsessed with good sleep factors. I want to make LD a big thing in the future, please guide me.",Nishant123456,AskIndia," 3 hours holy fuck, max i had managed is 15-20 min, i get too excited all the time and rest you must be knowing.

Ps- Can you guide me how do you achieve lucidity? Is it natural? I had a lucid dream where I was on the terrace of a building, I was standing there knowing it is a dream and I had a PC near me (which is weird) and I jump from the building thinking If this will wake me up. After jumping I dont immediately wake but I get a good feeling in my stomach and my heart beating fast and mid way in the fall I wake up. This was one of my favourite dream and   the other one where I am being chased by snakes on the beach shore I knew it was a dream but enjoyed the thrill. It has been few years since I got such dreams. i have had some lucid dreams. the best one was in which i became a special service soldier. I told mom that i can't die since it's just a dream I am a part of an informal lucid dreaming group at my workplace. We keep in touch through a WA group - sharing our dreams, tips to get lucid etc. I tend to get a lot of lucid dreams when I'm on NoFap. It's not a coincidence, I'm sure of it.

Edit: I meant to say vivid dreams, turns out they're two different things. I get extremely strong tingling sensations when I enter/exit the dreams. However I have not managed to get a proper lucid dream, I wake up too soon, or I'm like 70% sure it's a dream. I guess I'll keep on trying. Its been quite some time I have not had any lucid dream

I used to before

Does this have anything to do with excessive stress? You are so Lucky, it's been over 15 years I haven't had such lucid dreams. Miss the feeling alot. I think I may have had one a few years ago but I think I was just extremely drunk that day. I have regular dreams that I killed someone in a hand to hand combat on a very specific location near my house.I have received I'd say very minuscule training in fighting but it's nothing compared to what I see in my dreams I have lucid dreaming frequently, I had it first naturally but now I do that just to relax from hectic stressful day.

Which are the best countries to visit in Europe for 5D-6N?,42,c9epnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9epnc/which_are_the_best_countries_to_visit_in_europe/,53,1562353591.0,"We do not want to rush and cover as many places as possible rather we would like to explore more of 1 or 2 countries. Especially the food and culture and also countryside living if possible.

&#x200B;

Anyone who has done a similar trip can please share their experiences. 

&#x200B;

PS - 3 guys travelling in the month of either August or September",RehneDe,AskIndia," Amsterdam and Switzerland. 

Hands down arguably the best places in Europe. They both are absolutely beautiful and worth a trip, out of all the countries I‚Äôve been to in Europe, I find these 2 the most worthwhile. Switzerland is the best. Also you can try Austria . Anyways check the current weather as Europe is facing a very harsh summer now. Avoid Paris and Italy .
Switzerland is expensive by the way . If you are going to Geneva, you can visit Lyon, France just 1.5hr bus/train ride. In my opinion its better than Paris for French culture(Food/stay is cheaper than Paris).
You don't have a very popular Eiffel tower here. But I think its worth if you are nearby.

You can PM me if you want.

It's super hot here now 35C most of France has no AC. Is that the Droid from the new Star Wars movie? Chup kar ke prague chale jao... beer piyo aur chill karo.

Post on the orague sub and meet some local redditers... hit the party scene Food - Italy (my God their tomatoes and Olive oil!)    
Culture - Every country has culture  
Countryside living - Lots of places offer it. French countryside is nice. Southern France especially, lots of Europeans vacation there. Remember Cannes from Mr Bean's Holiday? All that beautiful country side was south-east France.   

I know Indians and Bollywood have a hard on for Switzerland, but I would not recommend staying there. It is a beautiful country that will take your breath away, but it'll burn your pockets at the same time. Smarter thing to do is start camp at a cheaper country like Italy or Spain, take trains or blablacar for day trips (suggesting day trips since your tenure is short) to expensive countries like CH or DE.   

Unless you're hell bent on it, don't waste time in pubs. You'll find pubs anywhere across the world - it's 4 walls with some lights and dhikchak dhikchak. You can pick up girls maybe and find a dulhan (if you're into that sappy eurotrip crap) if you're desperate.    
It's better to spend time/money to experience things that you can only experience there - food, homestays, countryside, vineyards, nude beaches, etc. Do go to bars though, you can meet interesting locals or fellow travellers. 3 guys? I do not know what is your exact preference but I'd ask you to consider Vienna, Budapest, and Prague. Culturally nice, diverse, and great for your pocket too. If you really want more country side maybe add innsbruck/Haltstatt in Austria into the mix.

&#x200B;

The reason why I suggest this, Austria has similar views as Switzerland, Vienna is awesome as a town, Budapest is both pretty and great for party (and 2.5 hours by bus from Vienna). Prague is...just visit it...you wont regret it.

&#x200B;

Also, in Europe most of these towns have night pub crawl walking tours and free walking tours, by companies like sandemann If you choose Switzerland, I have some suggestions that will save you some money. Switzerland is pretty expensive compared to other countries. Book hotels that offer free breakfast take advantage of it. Buy from the hot food bar of the two major grocery stores ""Coop"" and ""Migros"". They are usually 1/3rd of the price of eating in restaurants. 

&#x200B;

Public transportation is phenomenal in Switzerland, They will take you almost anywhere, so stay in places outside of major hubs like Interlaken & Zurich. There is significant difference in hotel prices outside of major tourist places.

&#x200B;

Look into getting a travel pass, there are two kinds, one of which you only pay half fare for any train, bus or boat journeys and another which you pay nothing other than the cost of travel pass. Switzerland, I took a rental car from geneva to zurich and back exploring little villages and towns along the way. You can also drive through the alpine passes(furka pass being a good one) during this time of the year. 3 guys? Bachelors? Apply for a visa before you make any bookings at all. 

Back in 2016, we planned a 2 weeks visit. The four of us, me, my wife and 2 of my bachelor friends, applied for Schnegen visa together. My wife and I got the visa, my friends didn't. Got rejected upon reapplication too. Both have a stable job, family ties to India, the documentation was complete, but they just didn't get the visa. If you're not really into partying and love road trips you can try Iceland. It's really beautiful and you might get to see Northern lights.", Pretentious_Fella super_banker notmefr QuiGonGingerAle notAcrimeScene kumarFromIT twistedrea1ms StarTrekFan spaceturd4 aashish2137 desi_ronswanson

All of the global sites require a visa or a master card for any kind of card transaction.

I had to travel abroad recently and I asked at the bank if I can use it in other countries, nope. Can they enable it for using abroad, no. Why are the banks and the government (rupay is a project of the government) issuing these cards when you cannot use it in most of the places for e-commerce online and no where around the world? Why are we being restricted on how to use and spend our money?
Is there any advantage in issuing these cards?

It is true but I guess platinum rupay are allowed for international txns . And govt are pushing rupay cards because of local data servers I think the newer ones make use of the Discover network so you can use them abroad.

Source: HDFC sent me a renewed Rupay card for my PM jan dhan yojana account.

Moreover, Rupay was setup mostly to challenge the Visa/MC duopoly. Rupay has deals with several international partners... 

[RuPay - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPay#RuPay_Global_Card)

I have an account with Yes Bank and they have not tried to force a Rupay card on me. I have a feeling that this is mostly a government bank thing. Though I assume that the pressure must be getting to private banks as well. I work with India's largest Debit card Manufacturer. The whole Rupay card things has been pushed down PSU's Banks throats by Govt of India. Rupay being a NPCI product is being promoted by the Govt. All cards issued under Jan Dhan Yojna were rupay cards and new cards issued during Re-Carding (Magstripe to EMV were rupay) Though Rupay has benefits of less MDR and they are cheaper for the banks to buy from Manufacturer's like us , mostly its just the PSB which will go for Rupay. All good Private banks are still mostly Visa and Mastercard. 

&#x200B;

It's always preferred to have atleast 1 non PSU bank account . Visa, Mastercard are foreign company and they take a high commission for every transaction, therefore to break their monopoly government has launched Rupay. From what I understand working little bit with online payment gateways is merchant end up paying about 3% to payment gateways out which a big chunk goes to payment processor (visa/MasterCard) that indian government is trying to divert to RuPay to keep the Indian money in India. I specifically asked the guy who was creating my account for a visa card and he assured me of that but I still got the rupay one. I had to apply for the visa later. Wrong move by Indian govt pushing rupay cards without studying the market. Visa and mastercard make huge profit with bank settlement take our money in USD out of India. NPCI developed Rupay card so that our money should be in our country. Yes it is true that Rupay is useless as compare to master card and Visa but in future i will replace mastercard and visa in India.

Is there a chrome extension that helps with this or something? I tried a VPN but it doesnt seem to change much.",jaberwockie,AskIndia," Yes somebody DM'd me with the same complaint once. After that, I have started putting the word ""Hindi"" in my title and in my Thumbnails. Use incognito mode and set location to US/UK on YouTube (Three dots in the top-right corner). This will change both the feed and search results Change your location to US and the feed changes. I bet you faced technical goo ji Youtube feed mainly depends on the videos you watch. My feed hardly contains any Hindi videos. Maybe you can see the Channel's name and decide whether it will be in Hindi or not. Hey I have a business Idea. A subscription based service that blocks indian youtube videos. Surely there is a demand I was hearing from a white guy (in the US), that many ""How-to"" videos are created by Indians. And he was quite impressed with them. And he told me how the Indians have advanced a lot! LOL! Need this feature badly for amazon prime.   
In YouTube, there used to be something 'worldwide' in the location but I think It is not there anymore.   I have turned off search history.  So I get feeds now based on my subscriptions I think. Start clicking 'Not interested' buttons on side of suggested such videos. My feed does not have any such recommendations any more. It even changes the Trending Videos section over time Try changing your 'location' from the in app settings. It'll mostly just change the trending page but that's step towards your goal of filtering.

Using VPN could also help. I guess. Use 2 accounts. 1 for Indian content if you watch that. Another for everything else. Remember to sign in to the right account.

For both, change your region to US/UK/Canada/Aus/NZ - choose whichever is closest to the kind of content you watch.

The moment you watch any content about India, you will tend to get directed to Jio-tier garbage. Make sure you subscribe to channels that match your interests and hit like or dislike appropriately. And whenever you see the wrong videos on your feed remember to click on not interested and choose the right reason why.

AFAIK the channels you subscribe to affect your recommendations quite a bit.

>Every time I try to search for reviews of anything

What's with all of the men dressed up as women in Indian comedy shows?,120,c75ccb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c75ccb/whats_with_all_of_the_men_dressed_up_as_women_in/,48,1561875179.0,"I'm an Indian who has grown up mostly outside of India, so I'm not sure if I'm missing out on some sort of cultural context for this. I've noticed in a lot of comedy shows, there's always some sort of guy dressed up as a women. I've seen it in both hindi shows and telugu shows (I'm not sure how prevalent it is in other parts of the country). Not that I think there's anything wrong with it but I was wondering if people genuinely find this sort of stuff humorous because I personally feels like it adds nothing in terms of humor.",contemplativeraisin,AskIndia," Indians think men in drag are funny That's cause they get to make 'women are dumb' or 'fat women lolol' jokes without women (fat or otherwise) being involved. Had such jokes were made to women actors like it's 80s Kadar Khan movie, it would upset the feminists. This is extremely common in mallu shows as well. And it's not due to scarcity of female actors. I think people just find it funny. Since you posted this, I'm trying to remember how Ali Asgar actually looked without his dadi get up without the help of Google and I can't. He has been in that character for years now lol My wife is from India and she‚Äôs saying these two guys did it and became very famous and then it became like a thing I'm in the same boat as you- grew up outside India.  I'd also like to know the answer.  I've seen [SRK and Ranbir Kapoor in drag](https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2012/02/srk-ranbir-630.jpg), and also Priyanka Chopra dressed as a man (I believe) in a show before.  It was curious! Because there are no funny lady comics. /s Men in drag make funny/ribald jokes which the small crop of Indian female comedians avoid.

If female actress make those jokes, they'd be typecasted/ridiculed. How many good indian femlae comedians do you know? I'll start by saying Bharti. Please don't say Kaneez Surka or one of those folks, they are atrocious. There are precedents in older films from the 80s and 90s. Govinda has dressed as a woman. SRK has dressed in a nightie while starring aside Juhi Chawla.

Don't ask me for the names of the films though; I wouldn't be able to recall them even if I wanted to. What shit. Are you telling me men dressed as women is only a thing india?

I am going to persue mechanical engineering. The internet scared the shit out of me!! I need some advice.,37,cdsn5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdsn5i/i_am_going_to_persue_mechanical_engineering_the/,26,1563282345.0,Apart from YouTubers making fun of mechanical engineers I thought it's a very reputed branch but people on the internet have a very different opinion. I will be getting into College in a week or so (IIITDM Jabalpur). Is there someone experienced enough to guide me through this and tell me what do I need to do to secure a good job? Working for automobile companies and making cars sounds like a dream but the internet says it is heavily unlikely for me. Can someone tell me how to work through this or atleast guide me on how to get a job in IT sector even after persuing mechanical.,i_am_siddharth,AskIndia," The job market for mechanical engineers is absolutely abysmal in India. Would not recommend. If you are good at computers or programming take computer science or ECE or any related field. I‚Äôm saying this from my POV when I graduated in 2012. With new developments in automation in industries, the demand for mechanical engineers is thinning out. Fellow mechanical engineer here. It is true that jobs in mechanical engineering do not pay as much as CS but it's not too bad. Since you are just starting your program, you can set your goals and prepare towards them.

* Jobs in PSUs esp. oil and power sectors are nice. Pay and perks are good. You can always explore growth opportunity once you are there. Prepare towards those exam and take coaching if you think it will help.
* You can definitely work in automobile and car industry. Do understand that you won't get to design cars right after graduation. You can explore material science, thermodynamics, mechanics, control systems etc and see where you fit in. In new cars, lot of mechanical components are being replaced with electronics. It would be very useful to develop programming skill during your coursework (take elective, online courses, coaching or whatever works for you). There are lot of good companies in India (national and international). Lot of people complain about salary but it get better with experience. 
* CAD/CAE is a good field to be in but its always better to know bit of programming. Trust me most of it is not as hard as people make it out to be. You do not have to learn C. There are easier programming languages. This will allow you to write your macro/utilities, and automate lot of mundane tasks. 

&#x200B;

Summary: It is not bad to be in mechanical. It is good idea to diversify your skill set to match the market needs. Focus on the fundamentals and maths.

&#x200B;

Send me a message anytime you have questions. I don't login into reddit often but will be sure to reply as soon as I see them. The big reason why we have so many people doing engineering is due to tech and IT companies. We have no where near that many jobs for mech, but colleges are just teaching and recruiting for all branches of engineering even when there's obviously not enough jobs in many branches. I don't know why this happens. Statistically speaking, it's quite unlikely. You will get a job unlike the reputation here. Manufacturing of everything, regardless the trade, needs mechanical expertise. Thing is it won't be that high paying or cozy in comparison with that of IT. For better ones, you would need added skills, learn some design packages like catia/creo and analysis ones as Ansys as you go. Also there is good possibility to branch out from there.

Good luck. How is IIIT DM Jabalpur in terms of placement? It all depends on the Institue's caliber to attract good companies for placement. Also to truly realize your dream, you must look for MS from US. ME people in India from average colleges mostly end up in IT. Currently pursuing B.Tech in mechanical. Would not recommend for the following reasons.

1. Almost every single industry is moving toward automation and electronics. Rarely do you see completely mechanical applications. Vehicles have electronic injectors, parts are made by CNC machines etc. I doubt there'd be any pure mechanical applications left (in the big picture) after a decade or so. Everything right now is microcontrollers and software coding. It's better to choose electronics, and learn mechanical on the side on your own. Much easier than the other way around.
2. The mechanical scene in India is horrendous. Overworked and underpaid doesn't even begin to describe it. I know people who work 6 days a week, 9-10 hours a day (sometimes even more) and make less than 5 lpa. If you have interest in mechanical engineering, I would suggest to take it. Job opportunity in core mechanical job is less but if you are interested then there are ample jobs.

For getting niche jobs you may have to get master's degree. Most of my friends from mechanical are working in IT but few who were interested in the field are working in core industry and earning good money. \- Mechanical Engineer (**ME**) jobs are less in number and remuneration is low in comparison to IT sector, but if you have the aptitude and contacts it'll push your career beyond your reasonable limits. Most of the times, contacts and social skill are most important in engineering field.

\- Please do remember that automotive and aerospace field is relatively low paying than food, pharma, health care, consumer products and construction sector. Reason is demand for automotive and many people are willing to work for less. Advantage of working in automotive field is the job turnover, so many companies just in Bangalore, Pune and Chennai.

\- Jobs in ME are very specific in nature. eg : BIW designer and in that enclosures, side-body, upper body or floor etc. Basically ME jobs can be classified as :

*1- R&D engineer*

*2- Design Engineer*

*3- Manufacturing Engineer*

*4- Quality Engineer*

*5- SCM Engineer (Supply Chain Management)*

*6- Service Engineer*

\- Not every MEing passed out can make it as a ME in life. Because college teach to pass exam and Corporates need applicative skill and knowledge to work in real life.

\- As a ME, I suggest core engineering subjects to only those who show curiosity, works on it and can learn by themselves, be it male or female. For the rest, I would suggest IT related subjects if they are still adamant is pursuing in engineering. Otherwise BCom, BBM and MBA combo or pure science.

\- Initially starting a career will be tough, it'll smoothen up as you progress. Being an ME will give you courage and no tension nor worrying about lay-offs. It‚Äôs a dead field in India with little to no research. I‚Äôd suggest go to CSE and be more employable. Look at auto and engineering companies and the best tech companies. Where do you want to work in four years ? First of all most Indian YouTubers are flunkies and just try to validate themselves by making fun of others. Please ignore them as their opinion doesn't matter.

Apart from automobile industry, there is manufacturing, food processing industry, pharmaceutical industry for mechanical engineers.

 I work in the construction industry which is a bit difficult for most people as you have to be quite fit and be commanding, but pays very well and a very fun job as you don't have to sit in a cubicle all day. It mainly involves piping (upto 88 inch dia) , installation of pumps, generators, construction of tanks in different types of plants. I started out at ~Rs 90,000 per month salary in hand after deductions 6 months after I graduated from a tier 2 college.  It's always good if you've got any extra qualifications like small diploma courses and design software knowledge related to the field.


But yes, generally getting your first job for mechanical, civil and electrical streams is tough. So if you dont want to make an effort to look for a job, join any IT stream and you can easily get into TCS, Infosys or any other IT sweatshops through campus placements.

If you want to join IT jobs, please do yourself a favour and don't join mechanical engineering.", jihad_dildo kpramod svmk1987 captainobvioushuman SirThighPiece ambar_hitman BigAwkwardGuy killer_unkill riyuk6239 longgamma 77-q5

NRIs who moved to India after an extended time abroad - how has your experience been?,55,c9o3av,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9o3av/nris_who_moved_to_india_after_an_extended_time/,43,1562406620.0,"I am considering moving back to India and would love to hear about your experiences, especially if you retired to India at an early age.

1. Cleared my 2 home loans before I moved.
2. Bought a car with cash. No loan
3. Moved to smaller city where monthly expense is less than 30000
4. I get rent from 1 house in Blore. I live in my own house in my smaller city.
5. I had ~70 l in shares. Invested 20l in friends business. It's been 3 years. Getting returns now. I invest keeping in mind that I lose the entire amount.
6. Bought some plot for 8 l, so that it can be used for kids education in future.
7. Rotating 10 l at 18% interest.
8. Interest + house rent runs my house.
9. Wife joined as teacher as she could not sit idle.
10. I did freelancing for 2years when I returned. But it was not worth as I had challenges doing from a smaller city.
11. I drop and pick my kid to school, help in his homework, eat, read books, do crosswords, spend 2hrs with friends (8-10pm), do some social service etc. Basically a house husband now.
12. Haven't touched a laptop since 18 months.
13. It takes 15 minutes from one end of city to another end. 5 minutes to outskirts.
14. City has 1 mall and an Inox. When we go to bigger city we go to KFC, mc Donald's, chilies etc

You need to adapt and find fun.

I am 38 years now. It is difficult to answer such questions because what a person wants, their cultural orientation, their economic status, their stage in life, feedback from their immediate family and friends, what they think is a good life, etc. vary greatly. 

There are 20 such knobs and you can get to any answer you want by tuning them and you could end up with both great and poor results in either country.

Any internet forum is not a great source of such inputs since you have no idea who is giving them. You might agree with what someone is saying but if you meet them in person you might throw out everything they mentioned.

A better model is to talk to people you have met so you can do a diff between their choice vs. yours and arrive at a qualified input.

What you don't want is a 13 year old giving you advice on how bringing his wife and kids back home was the most difficult thing he has ever done. I grew up in the US, moved back to India in my late teens, and then moved right back to the US. 

My parents moved back for good. So did a cousin of mine. She grew up in the US and then lived in Oz, came back to the US, met an Indian guy who was working in the US, and then moved to India with him. She loves it back in India. And I have a couple of friends who moved back as well.

In my view, it depends on how you identify yourself. I see myself as culturally an American of Indian origin, so I really struggled back in India. My friends who had grown up in India and then went back found it a lot easier. Same with my parents, who had a lot of their friends and family back in India. I also remember standing out a lot because of my accent and my mannerisms (arguably, kids are meaner than adults).

Secondly, things like your career and your aspirations play a role. I honestly have enjoyed the flexibility of jumping around various careers and I don't think that would have been possible in India. My friends who love tech or love finance have done great. I also think India has a ton of great opportunities now and it's a great time to make a difference.

Three, quality of life. It's an interesting mix. If you have a great job and good income, you could live like a king in India. Have someone drive you around, domestic help to cook and clean, much more affordable etc. But on the other hand, everyday Western amenities would be surprisingly hard. Getting anywhere would be hard, driving is nuts, lots of pollution, not exactly clean, and it's hard if you have dietary restrictions. But overall, if you're willing to live in a bubble, it'll be incredible and unparalleled.

Four, are you single or married? Western style dating is hard. A good friend who grew up in India moved back after 15 years. He's really struggling with dating. He's fellow dark South Indian guy and unsurprisingly, he's really struggling to date. On the other hand, I have a friend who's a white woman from Wisconsin and moved to Mumbai and met her French boyfriend there. But I think if you have kids and a family back in India, it's a no-brainer.

Five, if you like activities, it maybe a bit harder in India. There's great stuff for families but if you like to go rock climbing or kayaking or sailing or what have you, it'll be much harder. On the other hand, if you enjoy clothes and jewelry and great Indian food and spending time with friends and family, India would be incredible. 

Finally, food and drink. India is surprisingly conservative when it comes to alcohol. It's really hard to get a good drink with your meal at most places. While India has a lot of great food, and even other cuisines, they all tend to be very Indianized. I have a chili allergy so I can't eat spicy food at all but even oats and Italian food in India are spicy!!! Allergies aren't well respected in general. Salads are not a thing and fake meat isn't common. Even with real meat, getting a good steak or getting bacon is really hard. So if you like traditional Indian food then you'll have a blast. If not, it maybe a bit harder. For me, this was the hardest. I don't eat a lot of carbs or spice and anything with milk gives me the runs. So I found it really hard. After a while of eating all those carbs and curries, I really wanted a fresh salad but even if you made one, getting salad dressings are hard. But I'm sure it's changed these days.

The are probably other reasons as well. At the end of the day, it also comes down to where you're living and whether you think you have the ability to go back if you didn't like India. Having lived and worked around the world now, I much prefer somewhere like Melbourne which has a much higher standard of living. [deleted] How much money you need to survive is all upto your lifestyle.

Before I moved back I didn‚Äôt have much cash but had invested in real estate. The rent money kept me afloat till I was able to settle again. Mixed... Except struggle with lack of social circle, most of the things are better. The years in Vaterland. I am also moving back after 9 years. Looking forward for it. My parents moved back (I‚Äôm in the process of moving back abroad) but keeping them busy is a challenge. My dad spends time with his college buddies but my mom finds it harder to socialise. YMMV I suppose. Gulhind here. Girls pay you a lot more attention, guys get jealous af and more malicious, and teachers have preformed ideas about how you secured admission into the college. 

Life's smooth however. My dad has lots of FDs that generate a lot of interest and he is now retired. I am glad he raised me in such a way that I don't splurge or look down on those less fortunate.

"Indians who are pursuing their masters in Germany, how does it feel like, how much time it took you to learn the language and what are the chances of getting a job there after your studies?",72,ca61ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ca61ga/indians_who_are_pursuing_their_masters_in_germany/,28,1562529209.0,,iwasnothereforthis,AskIndia," The first thing I noticed when I started working over here is the amount of respect everyone has for everybodies opinion, maybe it was just the company I work in right now, however everyone was willing to have a sensible and a productive conversation regardless of their position or level in the company. This also meant no micro or over management. I can work from home if I feet like as long as I am to deliver and also communicate with others if needed. I tend to work atleast one day a week from home and it has made me less stressed.

They also care about the work life balance, I came from working 12-15 hours a day (I actually quite enjoyed that, I like to code), to coming down to 7 hours work days. This has for sure had a good effect on my health, however I feel like I am not that productive.

As for my personal life, Berlin has a big population of similar minded people who have moved here looking to have a relaxed life while still making some money. There is always something to do in this city, however I also feel like I am living the days of my university again - this time I have the money - so it is a bit dangerous :). I had no problems in making friends.

I did, however, had a little bit of problem to find an apartment. I don't know if it was due to discrimination or if I was just unlucky - but in the end it all worked out okay and finally after 6 months I was able to find my own place. I have not faced any other kind of discrimination or felt unsafe in any way. There are a few neighbourhoods that my German friends asked me to stay away from, however they are in the city's outskirt and I have actually been there and still didn't feel anything.

I do miss good Indian food though. The lack of authentic Indian food is really sad to the point that it forced me to learn how to cook and occasionally I invite over friends to try out real Indian food.

All in all, I believe the move was really good for my personal life however I think I have slowed down the growth of my career. The later can be solved with moving to a different workplace with a more competitive environment - but I like it this way. Two of my close friends are working there now after masters. What I learnt from conversing with them 

* Masters can be hard because a thesis is almost mandatory in all good schools. A thesis is not easy to finish because it requires dedicated research and you need to defend it in front of accomplished professors
* Part time jobs are plenty and unlike US, you don't have to seek work inside campus only
* Both started learning german a year before coming to Germany. It helps to foster relationships among germans. 
* Job was not too much of a struggle for my friend experienced in IT sector. She was able to snag a job in Airbus due to her  5 year experience. However, my friend, who studied electrical, had somewhat of a tough time due to having no prior electrical engineering experience. Bottomline - Experience helps
* This is me speaking from my personal experience doing masters in USA - Even if you don't have experience but you are reasonably confident in your ability to solve problems and prepare well for interviews, this puts you in a category far ahead of other job aspirants. When I was doing masters, I saw plenty of my friends just applying for jobs but never really practising algorithm questions for interviews and moaned the 'lack of jobs' in USA. Bottomline - You have to be proactive and somewhat aggressive in your job search and also work hard to crack once you get an interview. Also, you might get rejected by several companies before grabbing one. Every failure will be a stepping stone towards getting the eventual prize. I had an acquaintance who did this some years ago. I'm not in touch with him any more, but I remember that he was going to German classes and had to pretty have a decent level of fluency in German language before even going there. There's also German language exams which you should clear before going there.    

Learning a new language is always great, but I don't think everyone has the patience and dedication for it. I suggest trying to learn German by going to some classes first. My eldest niece did it and had a tough time of it. College topper, had finished her B2s before she left India, had an internship after year one etc. but during the thesis is when she started hitting roadblocks linguistically to be able to pass the hurdles. So be prepared for that. Personality-wise,  she has blossomed, IMHO. She used to be the shy kid who'd never get a word out in any gathering but her time in Germany has meant she's had to put in extra effort to be heard as opposed to just close family around all the time as opposed to the niblings who moved to US/UK. 

Two more niblings have gone after her as she's passed on her experiences in the years in between and they are doing pretty well in their 1st year. RemindMe! 14 hours It feels much better today. Last two weeks were hot due to hear wave [deleted] [deleted] very racist people.

Caste Stereotypes and mentality in India.,46,cakonv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cakonv/caste_stereotypes_and_mentality_in_india/,39,1562619374.0,"I am a 25F doctor working in one of the Government Hospitals in Chandigarh and studying for my masters.

My parents are aware that I am in a relationship  with someone from a different caste and they're completely okay with it and caste is definitely not an issue for them.

One of my cousins(28M) got engaged last night and as it happens, I was asked by a few relatives about my marriage plans etc. My grandfather asked my mom about this ""one guy I have been posting pictures with regularly for the past five years"" and whether he's my boyfriend or not. My mom told him he's just a friend but he obviously wasn't buying it and was curious to know about the caste of ""this friend"".

As if being SC/ST is like being from Jupiter . Seriously . Btw I am SC and understand that you are a brave woman. My niece topped her school in 12th with 96% and got top college of DU . Let's see what is the level of casteism in DU . Hum to buddhe ho gaye . That inter-caste marriages doesn't work out

Stay away from people who are against your relationship, many intercaste marriages break especially because of parental or relatives' interference, if some people are against your relationship from start then they'll be against it even after you're married for years. parents and relatives interfere too much and it's pretty easy to break your relationship if you involve a third person who see your partner as some inferior life-form, now if that leads to divorce or breakup they'll compain that inter-caste don't work when they're the main reason for breakup. Cheating doesn't happen in India. So i got gmch, Chandigarh right.

There is no such mentality. If there was then people would have pointed it out till now. In reality, forward castes have caste supremacist mentality, but to support it they have to blame backward castes for something. 



It's typical victim blaming. Few casteist people even claim that backward castes too believe ""upper caste"" are better. Honestly, if it was true the backward castes would have voted for brahmins always. If it was true, then you won't have to worry about opposition from this SC guy's family since he is marrying someone from ""upper"" caste.




In fact, you might find dalits are less sexist than your own caste. Patriarchy comes from brahmnican system.

And as you are marrying this guy, remember, never ever take your future kids to your extended family who are thinking like this. Lot of honor killing happens from cousins even after parents have said yes for marriage. Such people literally think dalits as subhuman. I don't want to say this, but they will think your kids too as subhuman. 


And one thing, do not say anything against Ambedkar ever. You can say anything else you want, you can oppose reservation, but never bring Ambedkar in that. Some people think there has been deification of Ambedkar by dalits, they might be right sometimes. Dalits will forgive you for literally everything, except criticism of Ambedkar. Well, I don't have an answer to it. But I have heard this discrimination and 'well they are different from us, they have a different mentality' bullshit so many times. Do let me know when you have answers.

Kudos to your pair for looking to go forward in relationship despite being from different castes! Fair skin = upper caste Disclaimer: I am totally against casteism and do not consider any human indifferent on basis of cast, religion or that sort.

Now, what your Grandfather is speaking about is, in the past, when there was stark differences between caste, people belonging to different caste used to have different lifestyle, from hygiene to food habits, from their education to intellectual and many more things of that sort. The way they were raised, the way they were learned to live life used to be different than one another. I hope you are getting where I am leading you to.

For example, A rich Jaamindar or wealthy Savkar or A knowledgeable Bramhin or hardworking Farmer or lower caste person, these all have different lifestyle, different upbringing, different food habits, different thought processes. So you see, The way of looking at things will be different for different caste person. 

And when you intercaste marriage, things used get mix up. Hence they (grandparents) believe intercaste marriage should be avoided. I'm SC and what I can tell you is rather than having stereotypes, we are a very open family.. a progressive one. But there is a general fear when disclosing the caste.. Why? Cause the way your cousin judged your boyfriend.
Your a-hole cousin. (sorry couldn't resist myself) This post reminded me of this scene.

Can someone explain me why so many people ask me (tourist) for selfies?,27,ce05nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ce05nq/can_someone_explain_me_why_so_many_people_ask_me/,25,1563326926.0,"Hi, I've been in India, more precisely in Rajasthan, for about a week and many people asked me to take selfies and pictures with them. I really can't understand why, can you explain me?
Thank you",Nokse22,AskIndia," You guys have something like poverty porn.

We Indians have white skin fetish porn? ·ïô(‚áÄ‚Ä∏‚Üº‚Ä∂)·ïó For likes on Facebook and also to show off. Are you white? White people are a rare sight (especially for people in small towns) They want to show their acquaintances their 'white friend' Because you're breathtaking. More than anything, I think it's just a talking point.

As you may have noticed, there aren't many foreign tourists in India--at least not when taken in relation to the overall population. Outside of places like New Delhi, Agra and Jaipur, you're not likely to come across many people from far-flung states, let alone other countries. Taking a picture with a tourist presents an opportunity to ask a few questions--where you're from, why you're in India--and chat. For a lot of people (especially from humble backgrounds), these kinds of interactions provide a chance to tell friends and family how they've a new American or British or Chinese acquaintance.

Basically, you're a novelty--not an exotic, fair-skinned god, not mistaken for a celebrity, but simply someone who's very visibly different from everyone else (if you don't believe me, take a week-long trip to Raipur or Jamshedpur. If you see another foreigner, you'll probably give them a good stare and wonder WTF they're doing there, too). 

Kind reminder: if you're ever overwhelmed by selfie requests, look around you and realize that 99.95% of the people you see every day pass you by without so much as a second glance. One experiential aspect of India's massive population is that you're often in proximity to a more diverse, dense pool of people than you might be accustomed.

Edit and after-thought: also consider how many foreigners take pictures of Indian people doing fuck-all random things, like carrying baskets or preparing food. People want to document what's novel to them, even if that novelty is ordinary to others. What do you do when you go to a zoo and see a white tiger?

You click its picture.

What about yellow tigers?

Hmm. You just ignore them. Don't worry. While it may look creepy (and to some extent is creepy), Indians (sub-urban and rural) find caucasians or any other foreign nationals for that instance, as exotic people. 

You guys automatically get a semi-celeb status here.

I think it's because majority of such people have been consuming Western media (read: Hollywood) increasingly and are fascinated by them. To make you feel special of course (‡∏á„ÉÑ)‡∏ß...

After all it's the land of  ""Atithi devo bhava"" ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø Majority of Indians are still fascinated with white skin. You wouldn't see them clicking pictures with dark-skinned foreigners. There isn't really much more to it. I noticed a similar phenomenon in China with Chinese ladies hassling white dudes for selfies.", Shellynoire throwaaway14342169 Holypatchouli waahmudijiwaah your_girlfraand PrettyFarAwayNow trolloindos ThatIndianCoy erosensei TooErrIssHooman bunnykumarxyz
"People of Randia who use Apple products, what's your main reason behind buying them?",26,c85io4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c85io4/people_of_randia_who_use_apple_products_whats/,82,1562075696.0,"As the post suggests, I don't think I need a description to explain it. But since I have to, I'll ask that why people buy costly Apple products? Are Apple products really durable or it's just to show off?

**Please do mention the Apple products you own.**",ssj_cule,AskIndia," iPad

The only reason is that tablet ‚âà iPad nowadays. Android tabs are shitty. Android itself is doing nothing for tabs. macbook air 2015. Build quality, battery, highly portable. It been 4 years and still like new.

Edit: And it has the best trackpad. I own an iPhone 6. I bought it second-hand for 13k since I needed it to test an app supported on iOS. That was asked by the client and later after I provided the test reports I got money somewhat more than the price of iPhone (second-hand). 

In my case, I use only calling, SMS, Safari browser, Uber, Instagram. Battery lasts a day. I am not moving to another phone because I don't need another phone. My work gets done by this one, and don't want to spend money in buying something which I won't be using much. I have an iPhone 6s, 2015 13‚Äù MacBook Pro, AirPods and an Apple Watch. I started with iPhone, then bought a MacBook and bought AirPods and Apple Watch S4 thereafter. When I bought the phone, it seemed to be the better option compared to Androids at that time(S7, OnePlus 2). 

Then, I needed a laptop. IMO 2015 MacBook Pro is still the best laptop you can buy. It has excellent trackpad, very good speakers, good keyboard, and macOS works very well with iOS. Apple laptops are very durable too. Hence, I bought MacBook Pro. 

The experience of using an iPhone along with MacBook Pro is incredible. Handoff between iPhone and MacBook, picking calls, seeing messages on mac, universal clipboard are too good. The products are very durable too. I am typing this on a phone bought over 1000 days ago which I updated to iOS 13 beta few days ago and is better than ever save for battery life.

AirPods are awesome for casual listening and very comfortable for long hours. My ears pain when I wear in-ear earphones for more than 30 minutes. They work very well with both the phone and mac. Having Siri on Airpods is great. 

Recently started using Apple Watch for tracking walks. It has a very good interface for iMessage and I love chatting using Apple Watch. 

I agree that Apple products don‚Äôt provide 2x utility over the phones which cost 1/2 of that. But no other products connect as seamlessly out of the box as Apple products do. 

All things considered, I would say Apple products have good value for money at least for my needs. I have a 2014 MacBook Air, iPhone XS, AirPods, Apple Watch and a Time Capsule. I‚Äôm all in :(

The MacBook still works great. It‚Äôs been 5 years and is extremely durable.

I think with the rest, I‚Äôm just comfortable in the ecosystem. I got the AirPods as a gift and wouldn‚Äôt buy them other wise.

But I think I bought so many because:
1. They last quite well. They don‚Äôt slow down as fast as windows or a couple of androids my friends have owned.
2. The ecosystem works really well. There are small things that you get used to. Like the watch and phone syncing seamlessly along with the AirPods, copy paste between phone and laptop, unlocking the Mac with the watch and hence not needing a password, the fact that my laptop backs itself to the time capsule every time I connect to the internet at home.
3. The security that Apple offers. This may just be marketing, but I do believe that they care about user privacy and security and some of their developments in Safari etc back this up. Ipod touch 2nd Gen. I got it for free, still kinda works if you know exactly where to touch ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). No updates has been there for ages and shit sucks in comparison with whats available now. Sound is still good. MacBook Pro. Initially, I only started using it because my employer gave it to me. But I'd gladly pay for it now. I‚Äôm using the same phone I was gifted by my dad in my first year of college ( iPhone 6s).  Today after 4 years
1. It runs on the latest and most secure OS parallel with iPhone XS.
2. It is optimised for Snapchat and takes great photos.
3. I don‚Äôt have to worry about an app not being supported for optimum performance for my 4 year old phone.
4. It‚Äôs goes great with my laptop and iPad, I have recently bought. The ecosystem is the most underrated thing with apple.
5. I get a stand-alone user experience not having to worry if the next update is supported by my hardware etc. I don‚Äôt have to worry about things like ROM(miui, stock etc), RAM, processors etc. Just go and pick an iPhone in your budget when you feel the current one is dying out. iPad 

I wanted to go paperless and iPad with pencil is awesome to take all the notes. And after using it for an year I really like iOS now. got a macbook from work. now im just comfortable with them: been using them for 10 years . i have an iphone 6, and the apple ecosystem is just something i'm used to now I own a iMac, MBP 13‚Äù, iPad Pro 10.5, iPhone XS Max, AirPods, Apple TV. 

Why two computers? My mom surprise gifted me the MBP when I already had the iMac. Next generation will probably sell them both and get a 15‚Äù MBP. 

Use the iPad just for media browsing, Reddit and occasional games (PUBG is pretty awesome on the iPad). 

Why Apple? I can afford them and also I ask friends to get them for me from US, so it‚Äôs cheaper. 

They last a long time. My previous MBP lasted for 6 years while my friends were changing their windows system once every 2 years or so. I‚Äôve no plans to upgrade my MBP for another 2/3 years. The MBP‚Äôs touchpad is at a god level where I can even do minute editing details without the need for a mouse, couldn‚Äôt find such a touch pad in a windows machine yet, it‚Äôs so good I even bought a touch pad for my iMac. 

Also Apples warranty is pretty solid even in India. Just 2 months ago, 3.5 years into buying the laptop, due to staingate policy, I got my casing, LCD panel, keyboard and touch pad changed. No other company would honor something that was purchased years ago. They even replaced my water damaged 4s a few years ago. Over the years, I got multiple things replaced out of warranty too. Also they‚Äôve international warranty, not many companies offer that. 

I‚Äôve used multiple android phones over the years and always find myself getting back to the iPhone. Why iPhone? Because it doesn‚Äôt get slow after 8 months of use age. I didn‚Äôt have this problem with the google line of phones but with 1+ and Samsung, they used to get slow after a few months of use age. It used to be so annoying. Plus with android, I used to spent half the time tinkering with customization, trying to make them perfect, with iPhone, nothing to customize, just use the damn thing. 

I don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äòecosystem‚Äô because I think Googles ecosystem is better in terms of software services.", rishi71 cowChewing domxss SmartestUnknown SheikY09 SirThighPiece svmk1987 JitHu1306 nehru_ke_galti short_of_good_length BothOne
Are electric vehicles really going to provide clean means of transport?,23,cdjk3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdjk3x/are_electric_vehicles_really_going_to_provide/,33,1563236640.0,"Although, electric vehicle may not produce emissions but they will use coal power to charge. Ofcourse in the future we may harness energy from renewable resources much effectively, so, that shall eliminate the coal problem and complete clean transport.

But, what about the battery? It will use chemicals, which shall highly pollute soil and rivers causing a permanent damage. And since it will be mass produced, battery and chemical usage will also go high. 

So I was wondering if electric are really clean as promised?",ImpressiveCareer,AskIndia," well, head over to Hyundai which has just launched an EV. It has 400 km per charge, and battery is warrantied for 2000 charge cycles. Thats 8 lakh kilometres. Thats a lifetime of driving. Lithium batteries are almost 100% recyclable btw.

&#x200B;

The car will last a lifetime since, there are no moving parts in the engine, no oil, no filter, no coolant ... even braking can be with reverse charge/regenerative .. so probably the most environmental impact will be by the changing and disposal of tyres.

&#x200B;

It can charge in 1 hr using a fast charge. And if you put a solar panel on your garage or house, it will charge the car over the weekend, and you can drive all week happily for free. In cases of power failure, you could use the battery power of the car to act as an inverter for your home. Yes, Electric cars are much more environment friendly right today -

1)The efficiency at which we burn coal in a power plant is much higher than the efficiency of ICE (45 vs 30%), this is never going to change dye to the size and weight constraints of ICE engines. 

2) Regulating & reducing emissions of coal plants over years is much easier than doing that in end user cars / bikes etc.

3)Lithium is one component of a battery, even when a battery is no longer suitable for use in cars, it can be used to power homes for many years. Solids can be recycled more efficiently than gaseous emissions.

4) Oil is carried by massive tankers which have caused oil spills. This is risk to marine life is completely eliminated. Yes and the reason is - efficiency of scale.

One giant coal reactor is more efficient than millions of little IC engines. The total carbon footprint will be lower. 

Most importantly, the pollution will take place in one centralized location AWAY from population centers in a controlled environment. You wont have millions of exhausts spewing CO, NOx fumes in your face.

You are also ignoring the amount of energy and pollution that is required to drill oil, transport it, refine it, transport it again to millions of gas stations.

Here is a detailed article which references credible sources on this issue:
https://www.lightsonsolar.com/emissions-and-efficiency-in-electric-cars-versus-gasoline-cars/ In current state of affairs no. 

Cause the energy is also getting produced in the coal powered power plant. When our majority power is being generated by renewable energy sources. Yes. Also the lithium mining is not the entire best thing for environment. And battery technology needs to go a long way. Before thats happens. 

But well this is a start.

Maybe alternative to electric is the future. Maybe hydrogen cells. Going to ? Yes sure in the (distant?) future, but not at the moment.

Ev & battery tech is still evolving and not entirely 100% clean or substainable..

Lithium is a fairly limited natural resource and will (estimated) run out in a few decades. It also is very hard & costly to recycle.. (+demand is excessive, EV, smartphones etc)

I think there needs to be a newer different battery tech other than lithium ion. Hydrogen fuel cells ? Solar powered ? Mini nuclear reactors...who knows They better do.

From what I've read, electric cars are not as necessary as electric trucks or electric earth movers (there is a JCB joke in there) or electric ships. Trucks, ships, goods-trains- these are what sustain our city-based urban civilization. Right now all these depend on diesel.

It would be better if the world prioritizes Lithium batteries towards these rather than driverless Uber fleet carrying passengers.

It's finally taking off after the past few years. It's a lot of hardwork tho and i had to completely sacrifice my social life. I did engineering and never liked it. But, I do like making money and having a lot of personal time to fulfill my hobbies. So I sucked it up and got the min grades needed to go for MS in US and since then I have never worked more than 40 hours a week making enough money to retire (in North America if i want) at 45.

I know some people who pursued their interests from the beginning. I think maybe 10% of them actually made a viable career out of those. Even then, they are slogging 90-100 hours a week to keep afloat. *subscribed this thread in anticipation of chetan bhagat posting here* Still working my first job in IT. It's not that I decided engineering isn't for me. It's just that I ended up trying a bunch of different things and enjoyed them more. Was always into design and art, somehow got into a decent engineering college and absolute fucking hated every second of it. I really wanted to leave but didn‚Äôt have the courage. 

My gf really motivated me to get back to my artwork, I worked hard for 2 years, got a few exhibits and clients in the country (and some international events as well). Applied to my dream school in the States. Got in with 70% scholarship (highest they offer anyway) and left after taking a student loan. 

It‚Äôs been great so far and I have the need to excel at what I do. I couldn‚Äôt give a rats ass for engineering. Better be terrific at what you do than a mediocre or poor engineer. Dropped Outta engineering started my BBA, currently interning as an HR generalist at a reputed firm. Planning to do my MBA soon. Software Engineering I started my own business, got an MBA, moved to Hong Kong and am kicking ass in a startup. Engineering gave me the thought process though more than anything to tackle things in a structured way. I never thought Engineering is not for me! I loved every bit of it! The calculations, the projects even got into Tata Motors when I graduated in 2016, what I did not like was the limited growth opportunities and lala culture of big core engineering companies. I almost thought I won't fit in such an environment, same time got into a big startup, kicked ass there and moved to Dubai in a better role. Earning decent living here, planing for my MBA in 2021 from the west. Dropped out of MCA. Started doing graphics design, interior design, train personal clients in gym and diet charts stuff.

How is life different for an Indian in USA compared to India.,65,c7dum7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c7dum7/how_is_life_different_for_an_indian_in_usa/,50,1561930349.0,"I had a discussion with my brother who's obsessed with USA just like every other Indian dreaming to live the American dream. I told him its not great based on what I see on reddit. 

My argument points were: 1)Healthcare is really expensive,2) Indians will always considered  second rate citizens,3) economy does not favor the lower and middle class and makes it much harder to sustain a family of 4 than what it will be in India,4) legal problems and police matters siphon away time and energy more than what it will cost in india,5) the quality of life that everyone dreams of costs a lot of money in the name of taxes, 6)you will never be able to enjoy life like a white American and that's just true.7) everything from starting a business to buying groceries is more expensive than what it cost for the same thing in India.

He gave me his reasons why he thinks USA is the best country to live in and  why I'm wrong:1) the country has a better constitution and protects the citizens much better than Indian constitution, 1) police actually helps people instead of extorting them and isn't corrupt like indian police, 2) citizens get a fair chance at life and if they are talented they can get successful unlike india where even talented people can never make it big even if they tried, 3) no nepotism and people aspire to make a name for themselves unlike india where actor's son is actor , politicians son is politician, doctors son is doctor,etc.4) much much better climate and no pollution, cleanliness and sanitation are actually a priority unlike india where its a political stance to get votes and publicity. 5) life is easier compared to india and if you're any bit competent you can make a living. 

Now we're both thet Desis and have never been outside even our state let alone the country and all that we know about any country is through internet. If anyone who's lived in USA or currently lives in USA is reading this tell me who is more wrong me or my brother.",MGsquare,AskIndia," Life in US has its own share of problems. Subtle racism, crime and drug issues (some areas in cities are labeled as ‚Äúseedy areas‚Äù), healthcare costs if you don‚Äôt have proper insurance. Unless you are a Green card holder or a citizen, you have no safety net. Depending on where you stay, you could have a support system or be living and feel completely alienated. 

But the advantages are lesser population, lesser pollution and social freedom (ie novody gives a fuck about your life choices). They value individualism a lot, so if you are a hard working person with strong work ethic, you can definitely be appreciated and rise in corporate circles. 

Every situation is not black and white. You and your brother both have valid points. As a white American, I don't want to comment too much on the Indian side. But I'm close with a lot of people who have moved here from India (gf and several best friends are Indian, call a lot of their parents aunty and uncle, etc.) and I'll make a few rough suggestions.

My tl;dr: It's probably a bad idea to move here unless you have a job offer or a solid plan to earn at least $60k-$70k a year, or are accepted to a very reputable university for a program that you can afford. But if you do meet those criteria, most people seem to enjoy it.

1. Health care is less problematic than it used to be - my sister had an entire pregnancy and multiple surgeries with no bills whatsoever because she had coverage through a government program. But you do need to have a plan for how you will get health coverage, either through your job or budgeting for it.
2. This depends a lot on where in the US you move and your social circle. You will likely have some experiences with subtle racism, especially if you have a noticeable accent (which anyone coming directly from India almost certainly would). But the process for becoming a permanent resident and a citizen is generally fair and transparent, and for the most part you should enjoy the same rights as anyone else. There is, however, less of a safety net for you if you suffer economic hardship, especially in your first several years after moving.
3. This is an extremely complex question. The economy does not favor the lower class at all. I do not recommend moving here to be working class. Some people make it work for them, eventually saving up enough to start their own business and succeed, and there are many success stories of Indian hotel owners and gas station owners who started from nothing and now have all their children achieving the highest levels of success. But they work unbelievably hard to achieve that and usually seem to have significant help from their extended family to get going. I could not do it that way, and if it were that easy, everyone here would do it.

3.5 For the middle class, it depends on your definition of middle class and the area where you live. The Bay Area is a terrible place to be middle class, but there are many great areas of the country where a single guy can have a wonderful living on an ordinary middle class salary. However, if you want to get married and have children, you probably want to break into the upper middle class or have a spouse who also has a middle class job.

4.  While there are excessive use of force incidents with US police regularly across the country, the average person doesn't regularly encounter much in the form of legal trouble resulting in any payment or whatever. The last time I had a ticket I just spoke to a magistrate and got it dismissed with one trip downtown, and that was 7 years ago.

5. While we do have taxes, they are pretty low overall for a developed country. But it depends on what quality of life, exactly, you are dreaming of. Because domestic help and childcare are really expensive, it's much easier for single people to afford a great quality of life than for married couples. You will almost certainly not have house servants to the degree most reasonably well-off families have in India - my parents are pretty well off, definitely top quintile of US income, and the most they have is a lady who comes in and cleans the house once a week.

6. I don't know if this is true. A lot of Indians seem to really enjoy their life here. My girlfriend has zero interest in moving back, even after I said I would be interested in trying out India. I do think that Indians who have an individualistic streak and feel stifled either by their family or by the cultural environment in India tend to like it the most here, because no one will be in your business unless you choose to invite them in. There are Indians at the top of basically every career field now here.

7. Yes, everything is more expensive and you need to keep US salaries in the perspective of US cost of living, especially if you are going to move to a hyper-expensive area like the Bay Area or Manhattan. But starting a business might be easier and less expensive, depending on the kind of business and how regulated the sector is. Many forms of business in the US can be started with extremely minimal paperwork, fees, and no approval process.

And finally - I have a lot of disagreements with my country's government and our culture and the way we do things, but ultimately I have stayed here and will continue to stay for the near future because now that I have finished my education I am going to work on improving it. I think the best reason to either not worry about coming to the US or only wanting to stay for a while is because what you ultimately want to improve India, which is a pretty awesome place where 1.3 billion people are currently living. If you decide you don't want to come for that reason, I won't take it personally. So I was born in India and reside in the US right now. I was in India until 9ish and then moved to the US. Even though the process took such a long time, I‚Äôm a naturalized citizen in the US but I can give you my two cents. 

I think both you and your brother have good and valid points, but I personally have to lean towards your brother‚Äôs points. The opportunities are greater in the US, people don‚Äôt interfere with your life, and I personally think you have more freedom. There‚Äôs less pollution, population, and it definitely is cleaner but I know India is taking initiatives against this.

Personally, I live in a place where I haven‚Äôt felt racism, haven‚Äôt been treated like a second class citizen and my social life has also been really good for me. I‚Äôm currently dating a Caucasian girl and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not the norm and might be even be looked down by certain populations in India. And you get the chance to experience so many new cuisines as compared to India. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Indian food is soo good but you can try something new everyday here. There are more opportunities here and there is a sense of a path for us here. I‚Äôm a huge traveler as well and Õèlife is so much easier when traveling with a western passport as compared to an Indian one. Getting visas and showing paperwork when I had my Indian passport was such a pain. And even if you want to follow your dreams and want to go against the norm, people don‚Äôt care here. 

Granted there‚Äôs problems here as well such as expensive healthcare, racism, nepotism, etc. but I personally feel the pros far outweigh the cons. However, I‚Äôve gone to India last summer and I can clearly say that I‚Äôve been too ‚ÄúAmericanized‚Äù and it came to a point where I don‚Äôt recognize India like I used to. So take my words with a grain of salt if you must and sorry if I was rambling haha. > Healthcare is really expensive.

Doesn't matter as long as you have a job-sponsored health insurance. If you don't have a job there, you can't live there unless you have a green card. So this is a moot point. For certain health costs like Dental and Vision, you can always take care of it on your annual India trip unless its an emergency.

> 2) Indians will always considered second rate citizens

Indians are considered second rate citizens even in their non-native state. I am more comfortable dealing with people and the police in the US than I am in another Indian state with a different local language.

> 3) economy does not favor the lower and middle class and makes it much harder to sustain a family of 4 than what it will be in India.

This really depends on the job and where you live. Can't really generalize. Economy doesn't favor the lower class but as a legal immigrant in the US you are not a part of the lower class.

> 4) legal problems and police matters siphon away time and energy more than what it will cost in india,

What? Seriously? I would say its the other way around. Law is very straightforward there and with accountability in most cases, unlike India. I haven't heard anyone just randomly having to deal with such issues.

> 5) the quality of life that everyone dreams of costs a lot of money in the name of taxes,

So whats your point? Either stay in India, pay less taxes and don't enjoy the same quality of life.

> 6)you will never be able to enjoy life like a white American and that's just true.

Neither will you be able to do that in India.

> 7) everything from starting a business to buying groceries is more expensive than what it cost for the same thing in India.

Sure that's called the Cost of Living. It does kind of correlate with the salary. You can't expect to earn western salaries but pay for stuff as you would in India.

There are valid reasons to prefer India over the US, but none of the ones you mentioned.

Edit: Also,

> He gave me his reasons why he thinks *USA is the best country to live in*

This is not true. There are better countries out there to live in than the US. You're both wrong in some ways. USA doesn't have a lot of the defects you mentioned, and also many of those points of comparison really don't make a lot of sense.  
But neither is USA objectively is the best country in the world to live in. It's not a utopia and has a lot of issues. Everyone has certain needs/wants that are unique to them and the weighing of those needs/wants dictate whether one situation is better than the other for that unique individual. No country is a bed of roses, it depends entirely on how one weighs each pro and con. 


 I grew up in India and moved to the US when I was 17. 

Although, I have never felt that subtle racism has somehow impeded my growth (professional and social) in the US, I can see how some folks have a harder time with it than me. 

I can tell you that based on my weightings, the US is way better suited for me than India. It‚Äôs not even close. 

I do also want to point out that even though some folks never get a chance to get green cards, they somehow do prefer the US to India. I know of a lot of people that bitch and moan about how bad America has been to them and how awesome India is but somehow have been here on H1Bs for more than a decade. I guess their weighting heavily falls on $$ because they don‚Äôt seem to enjoy any other aspect of this country. In fact, I personally don‚Äôt know of anyone who was here on a H1b and left the US on their own choice (I am sure there are a lot of them out there, just not known to me). Depends on where you live in India, how much you earn, your religion/caste. Life may be easier for you in India than US in certain scenarios. Nepotism is a fact of life across the world. It‚Äôs true even in the US. I left India after high school and have lived in the US now as a naturalized citizen for almost 3 decades. I think I could live in both countries and be happy but I chose to live in the US. I think your brother is more right than you but I caution you that it's just my humble opinion.

As a group, Indian Americans may face subtle racism but tbh I have never faced it, that I am aware of. I didn't have much money when I started but went to a good school and decided to start a business after. The business has flourished and I now employ other Americans of all shades, White, Asian, Black, etc. 

I have worked in corporate America and while that is soul sucking, it's not because I was Indian American. Has it negatively affected me, I am sure...but was there corruption in India... Absolutely. The thing about the US is that it exists in the extremes; at the very low and high end. What do I mean by that? Racists are usually found mouthing off because they are equivalent to the bums on the street. Nothing to lose and these people don't effect my life in any way, their frustrations come from society leaving them behind. On the high end, racism is more finessed. You can climb the ladder and experience great success based on your merit and talent but if you want to become a high ranking executive making in the 7 figures, you will have a hard time finding Indians there. 

You want to be successful and have a great quality of life, be smart, a great networker, don't just be friends with other Indians or family, go into business for yourself, venture away from the safe bet of medicine, IT, engineering, etc.

The US gun laws haven't affected me at all. I was a religious minority in India but as a kid never felt the burden of it growing up but as an adult I would rather be a ethnic minority in the US rather than a religious minority in India. I would rather be middle class in the US than India, everything is expensive but you also earn a hell of a lot more than you do in India. Water dude... these guys (USA) have clean water. Quality of life jumps up significantly in USA compared to India due to this one thing. Apart from that India I feel has everything or will get everything in a few years.

Before you go, see if you can get a credit card with low forex transaction fees, massive help. 

Also, if your company gives you a prepaid card which allows you to withdraw from the ATM, withdraw all money at once - as each transaction has a cash withdrawal fee. So, if you pay 5‚Ç¨ to take out 100‚Ç¨ that‚Äôs a whopping 5% as fees but if you pay 5‚Ç¨ to take out 1000‚Ç¨ it‚Äôs 0.5%. There will be quite a few instances when you would be confused on what to do. Like go to a sandwich shop -> do you clear your table after eating or will waitress do it for you? Go to super market, they have marked down prices, but is it for members only?   

anyway in all such cases just ask. People are more than happy to help. I read a LPT somewhere that search for [Places Name] popular tourist scam. Actually seems like a good idea.

There are asian shops if you need Indian stuff to cook.

Tesco, lidl, aldi, supervalu are the stores where you can buy stuff for daily use. Discounts happen quite often for items. So just get familiar with what you need. You can end up spending way for in things just because you want to try.

Looking for honest responses,28,cdim3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdim3x/looking_for_honest_responses/,24,1563232099.0,"I am currently working on a social service proposal for rural Bihar. I would really appreciate it if you could tell me what you think, both positive and negative. What could be some barriers/obstacles to implementing it in India? What could I use to my advantage?

We want to target teenage anemia by implementing a program in schools for a small fee which would teach young girls to cook (iron-rich, healthy) foods.  As part of the program they would make cookies which would then be sold in the city. The money would then be reinvested into the program and contribute to its expansion. A partner organization would transport food from the metropolitan area of Bihar to the rural areas, at first one or two villages in which we would test out the business model. It is a largely non-profit service, the only money to be won would be reinvested in the community. We would also conduct bi-annual blood tests to check the levels of anemia on the children/teenagers. We are still in the first steps of thinking it through, and of course there might be a lot of faulty thinking on our part. Let me know any ideas (what the cookies could be made of, would people in cities buy them/care if they knew where the money was going to, would we need additional partners, etc). Also appreciate any insight into Bihari culture, Bihari concerns in rural areas. Would parents be interested in paying a small fee for the program if they knew it would positively affect their young girls? Lastly, are there any other organizations that you know of who are doing this (which I suspect there are many)?

Thanks so much for your help",jtglnd,AskIndia," [deleted] I think people would not pay for education of cooking of iron rich food. That nominal fee must be removed. 

And you'll need quarterly Hb estimation to keep good track of Anemia recovery

Edit : I'm assuming the fees is borne by the school girls? So if I understand correctly - girls in village school pay you a small fee, in return receive cooking lessons, 2 blood tests a year, and bake cookies, which you then sell at a profit to socially conscious buyers. Is it legal to make children work and then sell it, isn't it child labor?

As far as I know, no-one eats cookies in rural Bihar. Maybe occasionally they eat Biskut. There are local bakeries which are really cheap and efficient. You may partner with them and provide free knowledge to them.

Pardon me for ignorance, but it seems like a group of MBA people trying to do a course project. Why not first try this in cities of Bihar? It's not like that there is no teenage anemia in cities. Cities in Bihar will be considered as rural areas in rich Indian states. Once you succeed in cities, it will be easier to start new branches in villages. What is the reason for teenage anemia in the first place? Oh boy. You want honesty? This is hilariously terrible.


You‚Äôre trying to fix an issue by doing nothing for the issue. A blood test? Really?

You want them to pay you for learning things which there is no demand for in rural areas; who the fuck eats cookies in rural Bihar?


You were already up against a steep learning curve for the population- ‚Äòiron rich foods‚Äô in their diet; and now you want to first teach rural Bihar about cookies? Do you know how much time and resources it takes to teach just one of these things to a rural population?


These young kids will now suddenly pay you to make cookies for you, and a ‚Äòpartner organisation‚Äô can transport them to make money. Unless your ‚Äòpartner organisation‚Äô is your unpaid friend on a cycle rickshaw how are you covering costs of logistics?


And now you have to deal with food freshness because you‚Äôre traveling with cookies in the maddening heat. So now, you either make like 10 cookies a day or teach the kids how to add preservatives. Great addition to their already deficient diets.


And then you further want insights into the culture of where you‚Äôre trying to sell on top of this hilarious business model.

How is a girl making the first move perceived by Indian guys?,27,cb5sdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cb5sdk/how_is_a_girl_making_the_first_move_perceived_by/,41,1562730288.0,"I'm 18 and I've never dated, I don't have any experience at all regarding this so I need to ask here.

&#x200B;

\[ I'm extremely interested in this shy guy, he is also in his late teen years (18). I know he is somewhat interested in me as well, but I can understand it's a little scary for him to make a bold/first move. I'm willing to do it, as long as it does not send across a wrong message. 

I'm under the impression that he might think it too weirdly confrontational or that I'm using him to gain some other guy's attention or that I'm after his friends or that I'm just bored, there are endless possibilities. I also don't know if I'm overthinking. I also think women don't usually make the first move in our society, so he'll get overwhelmed and that will  scare him away. His non-shy ""bros"" probably have never had a girl confront them, so he might think I'm too clingy when he compares his and their experiences. 

I'm very sorry for my ignorance, I know some of the stuff I wrote is probably wrong which is why I am here - to know the actual reality. \]

&#x200B;

If someone could please tell me how is a girl making the first move perceived by Indian guys (especially shy ones) it would be really helpful. Thank you.",imsorryifellasleep,AskIndia," GO AND MAKE THE FIRST MOVE. PLEASE.  


PS: Most guys I know (including me) will love that attitude on a girl. Go be an orange in the world of apples. It'll be a refreshing change. We didn't exactly sit down all together and decide on how we all feel about it. There was no referendum either. If some girl approached me, I will definitely be on cloud nine....

Can't say for other dudes

But it feels nice that someone likes you and actually took the courage to make a move

As a guy, I know how tough it is to do it , so even if I won't be interested, I will go on a friendly coffee ...


When will this day come ( sobs) Make the move kid! It's not awkward at all. 

Will be good for a change :
Best wishes. Lol, women don't make the first move? Not always true. My first gf messaged me on fb first and then she said that somehow her messenger wasn't working very well and asked me my number.

I didn't find it very weird though. Ask him out. I think you should take the charge and ask him out. dont over think this shit, just put yourself out there and see where it goes. This was so much easier when there were no devices connected to the internet The way I see it, if you make the first move and the guy doesn't like it, do you want to continue seeing a guy who can't appreciate a woman making her own choices? I made the first move because my bf is shy. It's been 8 years and he never thought much about it. He is just happy to be with me. 

Go girl, make first move. Never left anything for regret, I didn't and I am happy with my bf As an 18 year old guy , I can say that you really are overthinking it OP , gg. Stop assuming things, just go and confront him. Find him alone and ask him out for coffee or drinks or whatever is slightly further from wherever most of your college folks hang. Ask him at a time when you can go now so that it is just a yes or no question and he doesn't fry his testosterone rich teenage brain overthinking it or discussing it with his friends.

No hints, no eye contact crap and no shitty  through other friends drama. This ain't some Tier 2 city based Bollywood/South movie.

Start with casual conversation, coursework, career, parents, shared love for Modi Ji etc. If you guys hit it off, repeat it along with a ridiculous amount of texting hopefully followed by in due time with some sexting as well. No nudes with your face. Rookie mistake.

If you don't, then you had a few laughs and remain friends or whatever.

Everyone starts somewhere and usually make a shit load of mistakes in the beginning. It only gets slightly better. Look at this as a start of the part of your adult life which deals with the other gender and your relationships with them. Almost all of it is trial and error for the first few years. Shit I am 30 and its still trial and error for me. More errors though.

My first girlfriend approached me. I loved the crap out of her for it and still respect her post break up. If he is a decent chap, he won't mind who made the first move and if you guys hit it off, he will probably respect you for it depending on how secure and mature he is.", DesiPattha svmk1987 DrAwesome04 ThatIndianCoy Shellynoire anamika_96 rmenn Zvan xxyyccb rajutkarsh bootpalish
"Thoughts about the Indian remake? Hopefully, a thread for opinions about the show.",34,ccsnxl,https://i.redd.it/6f89yzqt64a31.jpg,25,1563071468.0,,nahsirk31,AskIndia," Watched the first episode, it's ok. Just like the French , Japanese adaptions. The Indian characters are the same old stuff seen before. Dumb Panjabi aunty, strict South Indian lady etc. (I may be wrong only seen the 1st episode.) The adaption of Dwight/Gareth isn't Impressive as the actor who plays him plays this type of weird chutiya characters in almost all web series I have seen him in. So nothing new there too. Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica!

It would be okay for someone who hasn't seen the UK/US versions. My honest reaction after watching the first episode : No God, Please No ! Nooooooooooooooooooo. I gave it a try and I disliked it. Looking at it from a production point of view, the actors are horrible. Other gripes I had with the show are some of the jokes are downright pathetic. Pammi and Amit seem so fake and forced. Chadda just seems to be trying his hardest Aamir Khan mimicry (circa Andaaz Apna Apna phase). I went into it with an open mind and I disliked it and many people I know disliked it for similar reasons. To people who liked it, all I can say is to each their own.

One reply I get for me disliking it is that my expectations would be quite high because I've already watched US office. However, my expectations were also quite high for US office after I watched UK office and it surpassed it. I know it's apples and oranges compared to the Indian scene, but that's exactly why I don't understand that point.

Having said that, I liked the Indianised weirdness of desi Dwight. Anywhere to watch other than hotstar ? Somehow, I liked it.. never thought in would like it... I am die hard fan of US office... But I started this with no expectations, that's why may be I liked it...
 Also I m trying hard not to compare this with other versions . It's a Hindi remake not an Indian remake. I've been hearing a lot of people give a lot of flak about the Indian remake of the office.
I mean I get it, it's so derivative of the office (us), that sometimes it feel like the dialogues were plainly translated and put up on the show.
I get all the complaints people have about the Indian show.


But, consider this.
A lot of people in India, a vast majority infact, haven't seen the office at all. It's a new experience for them. An experience almost as good as the one we had when we came across the office (us).

Guys, let's not forget the office(us) is at least one of the greatest comedy sitcoms, if not the greatest show of all time. And it's established  a near perfect image in our minds over many re-runs many of us have already done. 

It was near impossible to create something as good as the US one in the first place. So let's be glad that what we're getting is an attempt to make it as close to the US one.

Because for the guys who do know about the Indian television scene, I'm sure it's a welcome change. 

Let's just wish if in the subsequent seasons, if there will be, the producers are able to do justice to the show.

And be happy for the people who are unaware of the original shows, and are watching this show for the first time.

Because for them it may turn out to be an experience they'll cherish life long, like the one we had with the US one.
Because I know I did.

Remember, Michael Scott would like nothing more than a lot of people being happy.. This show really surprised me. US office is one of my THE favorite shows and I‚Äôve watched it over and over to the point that I know what expression the character would give in the next scene. So obviously I went in watching the indian version expecting a train reck. But like I said, I was presently surprised. It‚Äôs definitely not on par with the US version but I think they did a good job trying to get it as close as they could. 

I dint mind the blatant copy of every plot, dialogue, scene framing and expression. In fact I think that‚Äôs the reason I liked it, as it allowed me to watch my fav show with an indian twist. Hope they get enough support and come back for season 2. Not impressed Its not that good. 

Why even remake it? The original is already so good that any remake is gonna pale in comparison.   

Its like when Indians putting tomato sauce paneer and onions on a  naan and call it pizza. Don't even call it that, call it something else make it  original. Am I the only one who have watched Office US and liked Indian version more ? 

Personally , the American Office didn't have much spice but I liked it anyhow . Indian office has that spice and relatable comedy (especially the diversity episode) 

We are famous to make shit copy of good shows in the west but this is definitely not that one . I am waiting for more episodes.", Abhi_sama tedlit68 sleepygamer92 notdheeraj nou_kar vennai_1 nahsirk31 kevlarrr lllllll______lllllll Bapu_Ji rohan27nabar89
"Why does every Oyo hotel I stay at in India bombard me with ""free breakfast?"" calls in the morning?",43,ce7pd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ce7pd0/why_does_every_oyo_hotel_i_stay_at_in_india/,17,1563364574.0,"\[\[\[I'm foreign, sorry\]\]\] 

I've stayed in tons of Oyo properties in India over the course of the past five or six years. Most of them *insist* on repeatedly calling me for ""free breakfast,"" sometimes multiple times in the same day. Literally had to take my phone off the fucking hook, because I'm on holiday and don't want to wake up at 8am for an aloo paratha and some egg. 

Legit, is there a reason this happens? I have traveled extensively, and I have never been anywhere else where hotels routinely bother guests to offer them an optional service. 

(this isn't even the first time I've had to take the phone off the hook because of ""saar, free breakfast"" calls, either)

But this happens to me all the time in India (and this isn't my first time here), especially in Oyo properties. Can't even tell me to ""just avoid Oyo,"" because it seems like every half-decent mid-range hotel is Oyo-branded nowadays.",KooKooKawKaw,AskIndia," Haven't stayed in many Oyo rooms, but maybe they have this breakfast part of the room package and if you complain to Oyo that you were not served breakfast, they would be penalized? They are just looking after their best interest. Lol, this is hilarious.

I think as part of standardization, Oyo asks hotels to provide complementary breakfast. They are just making sure that if Oyo ever asks you whether you were served complementary breakfast you don't say no. Just a guess Always Keep the ""Phone off the Hook"". Simple - No Phone, No Calls - enjoy your stay! Just speak at reception that you don't want to disturbed in the morning . Want to avoid Oyo, you'll have to go for 4/5 Star hotel chain. Although I havent sayed in Oyo hotels enough to experience this, I have had similar experiences with hospitals - the nurses themselves fill the water in the water jugs because there are CCTV cameras even when you are dying of thirst. 

I feel that this is because the hotels want to deliver service and by not providing you with food, it seems like they have failed in their duty. They are probably scared that you will complain that they did not provide you with breakfast. 

A second plausible reason is that you are a foreigner and ""exotic"" I laughed way too hard than I was supposed to at *saar, free breakfast.* >don't want to wake up at 8am for an aloo paratha and some egg. 

You got eggs? Jealous, I've only ever been offered shitty carbs Maybe they clean the room at that time? I dunno man, seems harmless? Chalk it up to ‚Äúfamous Indian hospitality‚Äù. Bol de unko pele hi ki tang na kre I on behalf of all of Indians would like to say sorry for this appalling behaviour. Such difficult to avoid atrocities should not have been commited. Please  lets us know if we could do something to make up for this hardship you had to face. 

Perhaps if you could forward us the next hotel you are going to book we will call them in advance for you to inform them of your imminent arrival and preferences. Afterall its our personal obligation to look after our esteemed foreign tourists who enter India.

Give us one more chance to serve you better.

Pretty good laptops, including their latest Vivobook, Zenbook and ROG. Asus Vivobook X412FA

-512 gb ssd

-1080p bezel less display

-14 inch and 1.5kg

-good battery life (5 hours max)

-boots in just 1.9 second

-great backlit keyboard

-fingerprint unlock

Bought and been using this laptop for over a week now, all the things are upto the mark (display could have been better), it is priced at 48k on Flipkart.

Plus you can also get 1+2 year extended warranty for just Rs1800 which is actually priced at 99USD. 1+1 is for Rs500.

Edit - I just saw price has gone up to 60k, i bought it last week for 48k. >1) Dell Inspiron 5370

5580 has been launched.

Also, for inspiron series buy directly on Dell.com

You can customize some stuff there.

Around 70-80K this won't be a good choice. Dell 7572 is available for 65K. I have this. Bought it mainly for productivity stuff. Occasional gaming is okay with decent frame rate. 

Secondly, asus zenbook 13, vivobook S15-S530UN (Flipkart) are pretty good choice. Depends upon you.


And yes, buying online is safe. If possible buy from the manufacturer site. You'll get new products. At 70-80k you have to choose between two kinds of laptops.

1. Ultrabooks - i5, excellent display, 8-10hr battery life, good build quality (lightweight & compact) , sometimes you can also get a mx150 level graphics card. (you will compromise processing power for portability, excellent display & good battery life)

2. Bulky laptop - i7, a respectable graphics chip (gtx 1050ti/1060), trash display & 3-4hr battery life, plastic build, heavy. Upgrading the desktop memory will improve performance. Find out what motherboard it is and check its supported maximum RAM. Typically max of old motherboards is 8GB.

Since you're a coder, use this as an opportunity to investigate *why* your desktop is slow since these kinds of problems sometimes crop up even in work environments. There are lots of optimization possibilities. If it's a Windows machine, optimize registry, stop most background services, uninstall useless bloatware, clean up and defragment the hard disk..oh yeah, also vacuum blow inside your cabinet and PSU fan every month, and replace the thermal compound between CPU and CPU heatsink every 3 years - CPUs are throttled under high temperatures.", poco_gamer Ash_Sss rishi71 Feisty_Camel plshelpthedog

Please help me out.
I have a small family run fabric business in Chennai.
I have had two workers working in my shop. One was working for 15 years and other for 7 years.
They do minor fabric cutting job as well as cleaning the premises.
No documents etc is involved since they are working on oral commitments.
They have been very lax with their work for last five years but since we don't have other options, we tolerated them.
Ever since my father got sick, I was totally immersed in his well being and had to skip days at shop while my brother managed it by himself. 
The market being weak, we could not give them raise this year but a bonus of one month salary was given.
One is given 15k, other is given 13k.
They both took advantage of situation and walked out saying either you increase the salary by 1.25 times or they are quitting.
After few days they both returned since they couldn't find employment anywhere else.
I agreed to keep both for old amount for a month and told them that if they are able to get better options, they can leave anytime but from now on, I could only pay them 10k each.
In the meantime, my father passed away ladt week. 
On 1st July, I had 20k with me , so I thought I'll atleast give them immediately so they can meet their expenses atleast.
After taking 10k each, they both refused to continue and one threatended me with violence.
Today I recieved a call asking for 1 lakh settlement for him working for so many years.
I'm confused as how to deal with it.
Your advice will be really appreciated.
Regards.",pendanathan,AskIndia," Just a protip for those who are saying to record the convo: you can do so legally, but for it to be admissible in court in Chennai, the recordings have to be kept on the original device. Basically, don't transfer them to a USB stick and delete off your phone or anything: whatever you record on, keep it in tact. What do you mean how to deal with it? We don't teach kung fu here mate just contact the police ASAP and it should be solved. Do you have the proof of violent threat? If you do, go to the police station(with a senior educated family member - Go looking well dressed). Calmly tell what happened and provide the evidence. The police will call them and ask them to cut out the nonsense, in which case they will back away.

If they ask you to give a letter, then do that. But it is too much hassle for you and the police, so they will just try to call those guys hoping they dont get back.

If the fellows insist on their demands, send a legal notice saying you will deal with them in court. They will back off as they wont want the hassle of a legal case. Things getting out of hand.
Their ladies family members came to the shop and created rukus.
We are already stressed due to father's passing away. Brother getting nearly at break down point. I'm at total loss.
Please advice.
I dont know any lawyer since we never needed one before. Police is same. Never dealt with them. 
Thanks for all your advice.
Will discuss with brother tonight and proceed.
Thanks again. Dude contact police . These thugs will screw your over if you don‚Äôt deal it with force . Even bribe the police if necessary but ensure they are on your side . Involve police asap. This is extortion, I would involve the cops and please consult a lawyer first. A similar thing happened with my grandpa.

Since they're the less privileged in this scenario, if things get legal, they can concoct all kinds of stories to gain favour unless you have some kind of evidence which proves that you've paid them in full regularly. 

But nonetheless, please do lodge a complain if they've threatened violence for you own safety. 

Try recording your conversations with them, it'll be handy. get a legal notice , will cost 250 rs at max and lodge a complaint  in local police station. dont do anything else. Dont talk to them at any cost You want to be unharmed? Call police now!

Whatever is left put a certain percentage in a reliable fixed scheme of some sort like FD which can be broken easily online as emergency. The rest as SIP in index mutual funds as you're a beginner and instant redemption is still 50k only (so emergency issues). Get medical and life insurance ASAP.

All this is moot though if you fall into the classic trap of paise aate hi mauj shuru. 20k ke kharche salary shuru hone ke baad 40 ke ho jate hain.

Best of luck! Enjoy your salary, buy things you always wanted. Have fun. Meet friends, go out. Take your parents out, buy your dad a good scotch and your mom something she loves. Get your sister or brother what they want too. Give a small gift to that cousin of ours who‚Äôs just starting college. 

In 10 years, you will blow the equivalent of what you save in your first salary on a dinner out or at a souvenir shop during one of your travels. 

Worry about saving a couple years in. For now, give yourself a break. The things I mentioned in my first paragraph can‚Äôt be bought or experienced later in your career. *Maa ke liye silk saree...* You can refer to this old comment of mine on similar question. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9ca3de/comment/e59bic3 As others mentioned r/IndiaInvestments is a good place to start.
I would suggest the first thing is to set up an emergency fund(5-6 months expenses) before investing in MFs. 
Also make sure you take an health insurance Mutual Fund Laga le Congrats buddy. Hope you are proud of yourself. congratulations. Just save your taxes first if you are falling in a tax bracket. get yourself good health insurance. start a SIP in a mutual fund and partyyyyyyyyy I used to maintain separate accounts. Transfer a fixed amount and limit your exp to that amount. In the first and second year just create bank FD for short term to maintain liquidity. Once you gather some fund invest in different ways like buy gold once a year, mutual funds, bluechip shares and forget that amount. You use it as a long term investment.

Don't let tiers fool you. They're only useful if you're into IIM and stuff. What I learned from my jobs is they care about experience, even if you don't have any, they'll expect you to have some.

I know It sounds stupid, but that's the harsh reality. Life was difficult and embarrassing in parts but I'm satisfied.

4 years in Tier 3/4, maybe. Was fortunate and lucky enough to get placed as a fresher and the job started 6 months after the studies got over. Worked few years to gain good experience, responsibilities and *beef* up my CV. Always knew I was gonna do an MBA *runs for cover* not to change careers but to quickly progress the current one. Completed that from a very reputed university but one which is not expensive at all, on the basis of scholarships based on my GMAT score. So it didn't burn a hole in my pocket. In a decent, comfortable job now and I'm looking further up.

I would say I'm decently satisfied. The first 4 years did make a little introvert/socially awkward, but overall, looking at the big picture, it turned out fine. Still scope for improvement though, so that's good. I left a tier 2 medical college in the second year and my life couldn't have taken a better turn after that. I started my own store and its doing quite well. Tier two engineering college. Got lucky with campus placements. Worked as a dev for around three years. Wasn't very good at it. Landed an admit at one of India's leading B-schools. Got lucky with placements again.  
  
  
Very happy with life. Mast unemployment. Aaj soch raha hoon jaoon BJP ke office Bhakt banne. üòÜ Just graduated from one. Don't like the job I got, but it pays well compared to the one I'll get without the degree. Haven't received two months salary I studied in a tier 99 college due to extenuating circumstances. I'm working in IT now and had I applied myself well in my previous job I'd have done very well for myself. Still time to fix it. 

The one use colleges have is gaining a good network. Friends/seniors etc. I didn't have that either cos as I said I studied in a stupid ass college and I didn't have any classmates either and it wasn't distance either. That bad a college. Anyway, other than networking, rest is how much you make of it, after graduating unless it's IIT or something like that. I studied in a tier 3 engineering college, joined my family business after I was done, passed out in 2013. My friend in the other hand started working in 2014,and after five years and switching three times he now works in a multinational financial firm. He earns around 1.1lpm .

I realize this is the same shop he and his ""gang"" of 10 dudes used to come every night to make 'mehfil' in the PG  and introduce the concept of mehfil to younger members of the PG. Have heard some really sick stories of his time there. 

Me, about to pick up Aristocrat. Suddenly he eyes an Old Monk. Fight ensues. 

We end up with old monk. 

I till remember the glee with which he held the Old Monk. 

I wanted Aristocrat.",Nuarshack,AskIndia," 1) Nostalgia.
2) Cost.
3) Quality. (That rum is aged for 7 years, meaning that the batch you are drinking out of a 450 bottle was prepared when it was 30 bucks.)
4) Old monk is one of the best rum I have ever had. And genuinely the best drink I have had in my life (expensive Scotch included).
It has a great taste, a beautiful vanilla and oak aroma.
It is smooth and palatable. 
It is versatile. Goes well just as beautifully on the rocks, as with black/lemon tea, or on a cake, or with fruit juice (I recommend pineapple juice and rock salt with mint), or the good old Cuba libre.

And it had a strong brand imprint. Old monk has been equated with 'best drink', 'fun times', etc for so long that it is kinda synonymous for a lot of people. 
I am literally drooling just by typing this comment.. so you know what I a trying to say. Because Gareeb aur ab vo Fevicol smell ki aadat hogayi hai. Old Monk is love. You don't turn your back on love. that's husband material you'r dealing with. Because that's what most of us as college kids could afford.

And also because it is quite a decent rum, I still prefer Old Monk Gold Reserve over Bacardi and Captain Morgan I drink virgin mojito It's cheap, it's strong, and this may be subjective, but the hangover is actually pretty mild. But it causes gastritis like a motherfucker... *tezaabi ulti* Old Monk is consistent. It's not great, but almost every bar has it. The price is rarely high, and the quality never too low. Old Monk, at least in my eyes, strikes an acceptable balance between digestible and affordable--and for that reason, it's a fixture of both youthful parties and late-night, all-alone alcoholism. 

I, for one, don't give two shits about taste. If I'm drinking, it's to get drunk--so whatever I'm sipping, chugging or gulping is either going down fast or getting some Thums-Up. Doesn't matter if it's Old Monk or some shit dragged up from a sunken pirate ship. 

However, I have found that some alcohols--especially in India--feel far worse the next day. Ever tried 24 Karat? Guy on the street saw me with a bottle and told me it'd make me go blind. Drank 100 mL and woke up wanting to die. 

Old Monk is the fine line separating the kind of quality that other people appreciate and the poverty that pushes young people to liquors cut with petrol. Not necessarily a gender thing, maybe because it is just good rum and value for money like very few other things. My gf likes Old Monk a lot more than I do. Her 1st choice of drink usually, whereas it is 3rd or 4th for me. I quit alcohol now but when it‚Äôs winter, I find myself craving for Old Monk. It has a unique taste. Also it‚Äôs dirt cheap on the pocket. BC Aristocrat kaun peeta hai?

What is your opinion on cloud kitchens?,53,cbx74q,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cbx74q/what_is_your_opinion_on_cloud_kitchens/,25,1562888978.0,"So, recently my Dad told me that a lot of the restaurants on Swiggy are actually part of Swiggy's 'Cloud Kitchen' system wherein, the restaurants aren't actually dine-in places and are maintained entirely by Swiggy. It also turns out that lot of these ""cloud kitchens"" aren't really maintained all that well and because they don't have a dine-in option, you don't really know how the quality control is.

This seems like a really bad idea and I've actually decided to stop ordering from places I haven't been to personally.

What do you guys think?",Satahdi,AskIndia," I have worked with swiggy .. let me tell you about my experience .. forget the cloud kitchen, 99% of restaurants are shit .. they WILL use whatever shit they can to cut the cost .. swiggy does not helps either.. they take away nearly 28% off per order .. thus to get the profit, these restaurants have degraded their foods to such an extent one can't even fathom .. now my job was to supervise the photography of food in few major cities of UP .. I myself have done over 100 shoots personally .. leaving Hyatt regency in Lucknow, I've not seen a single restaurant who would nof do such gross shit, that made me give up on eating outside or even ordering. Now coming to your question of cloud kitchen.. these are a cocktail of poor hygiene with bad economic choices .. basically these people are lured into to by let's say a thousand views or visits to their restaurant on the app in exchange of a sum of money .. sales managers get monthly target, these sales managers have a specific area in a city .. and they literally just fool owners about these ""hits""  .. these assholes would do anything to match with their targets and get incentives..  now if you just open a restaurant in an app, and then go back, it counts as a hit. More over 'allegedly', swiggy has guys back in Bangalore to complete these hit targets .. and thus little to no revenue comes out of these investments .. hence this creates a vicious cycle where only customer has to lose.. they will cut down to shitty oil, low quality or dead meat, etc... To come up with a good return per order .. I often say that this zomato and swiggy thing, has degraded quality of food so much that you can't even imagine. Also so many tom dick and harrys are now opening these cloud kitchens in remote locations solely relying on these services for profit .. I have seen shit fall onto the ground, and then they packed it up and served to a customer later on .. one cloud kitchen in gorakhpur, had literally a toilet seat in the kitchen .. when a shoot takes place, 15 to 25 items are shot .. these are then kept indefinitely until an order comes and they heat it back again and dispatch .. my personal advice, never order online from anywhere via anything .. only outlet who are genuine with their quality are domino's and other multinational chains who have to live up to the reputation. I have seen from nobody to well known outlets and all of them disgusted me. These cloud kitchens have absolutely no accountability.. when confronted, they'll show the fassai licence which can be obtained how? You may well guess. The majority of restaurants listed on swiggy are not cloud kitchens. A few seconds of research is enough to find out whether they have a dine-in option or not. Not ordering from places you've never been is completely pointless. >I've actually decided to stop ordering from places I haven't been to personally.

That's what I do.

I do check zomato for restaurant photos.

I ordered from a cloud kitchen once. Didn't like the food at all. Hence stopped ordering from cloud kitchens. i used to order a lot from freshmenu which i guess is a good example of a cloud kitchen? it was great in early days. later it was shit. i guess they grew too fast and compromised on quality. in the end, i stopped ordering online. 

now i order from a local kitchen only outlet where i have seen the kitchen, met the cooks. most of the time i do take out so i actually get the food prepared in front of my eyes. in the end, labels do not really matter. kitchens which only do take-outs or home delivery get a lot of flexibility as they do not have to spend resources on waiters and of course the dining area and such. this local guy decided to not have seating because it would have compromised rest of the operation. he is running indian, chinese and bakery from his establishment. tons of space for the cooks and baker. kitchen is accessible to you if you do take out and want a tour. friendly owners. 

it all depends upon the operator. you find a few good places. you stick with them. and you move out if they become shit. 

a restaurant does not guarantee a clean hygienic kitchen. unless it is an open kitchen which you can see from the dining area. eating out would always have the risk of food contamination. find a local small business catering to your requirement. ask them for a tour of the kitchen. and support them if they deliver on your expectations! I once ordered from a place called Midnight pizza and food, that shit was nasty as fuck. They are also huge contributors to your neighbourhood garbage dump Wholeheartedly agree.. I am never satisfied whenever I order in.. restaurants can get away with a lot of things.. things that would never be acceptable in a dine in situation.. I have received undercooked food, stale food, parathas with soil in them (literally!) and so on.. the irony is- whenever I order I want my food as soon as possible.. but my. Heart sinks after seeing the piping hot curries in flimsy plastic boxes.. some dishes are just not meant for ordering.. There‚Äôs no joy anymore in eating a special dish..  at least we had the consolation of ordering tried and tasted dishes from trusted restaurants.. this cloud thing will take away that one thing too.. there‚Äôs no accountability here.. reviews are losing their impact due to fake ones. I frequently order from a cloud kitchen, food tastes great, packaging is good. Never had any issues. I don't get food from anywhere where I can't see the food being made. Cloud kitchens are governed by the same rules that govern regular restaurants. They have to procure the same licenses, have to undergo the same kind of audits, etc. Besides, it's not just Swiggy or Zomato that have cloud kitchens. 

Cloud kitchens are a business by itself and there are a lot of third party businesses,including the likes of Future Group (that own Big Bazaar) that have their own cloud kitchens.

These kitchens are as clean (or as unclean) as any other restaurant. 

In any case, how many times do you check out the kitchen of a restaurant when you dine in? In all likelihood you could be eating at places with great ambience and a dead lizard in the kitchen. How can you be sure? so looks like a food with great taste can be sold on cloud kitchen. is it hard to make such food?", Kinky-Monk InfiniteAgony rishi71 chromaniac 4-20BlazeItMan backagainonreddit Samruddhi0890 latleepyguy ParkingDriver7 Froogler thedesijoker
My ex-company(a giant MNC) wants me to pay notice period recovery amount even when I didn't propose the last working day.,65,c7njxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c7njxm/my_excompanya_giant_mnc_wants_me_to_pay_notice/,45,1561980636.0,"TLDR/I quit my desk job, since I want to pursue adventure sport of paragliding as a living.I resigned, Manager accepted & he proposed a relieving date - all on email.The company wants me to pay notice period shortfall.

I absolutely do NOT want to pay the notice period shortfall.

**How do I go about this?**

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is indeed long, but please read through for details-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sequence of events in summary:

1. I resigned (official email date 1st January 2019), requested a relieving date from my Manager.
2. My Manager confirmed resignation acceptance & **he proposed the last working day as 28th February 2019**, on email (HR in copy).
3. Per discussion with the Manager, I completed my handover of projects/documentation. I complete last work day formalities & wait for full and final settlement.
4. On March 25th, HR tells me I have to pay a notice period shortfall waiver of 1 month. (citing notice period in contract being 3 months & I have served 2 months )
5. I try to explain, that the date was NOT proposed by me. I followed notice period as advised by the manager & as discussed between me & the manager.
6. They say - Whatever is written in contract takes precedence. Moreover HR cites that the Manager did not explicitly mention in email that the notice period is waived off. I have to pay if I have to clear the dues for the retirals to be processed.
7. Furthermore, HR says this matter is upto discretion of the management ( Management = Centre head of the premises I worked at)
8. My manager is spineless, but I have brought in level-up manager (American) in the communication chain & I would be meeting the centre head in about 9-10 days. (he is out of India right now)

\---

&#x200B;

I have worked for the company for past 6 years. (Out of total 11 years of my total work experience)The company is an Indian division of a giant European MNC.

About a decade ago, the Indian division was mostly a manufacturing facility in Gujarat.

Our centre head is someone who is a veteran from that setup & mostly runs the centre basis same factory-driven-mindset, with loads of hierarchy & ""well set"" grooves and ""network"" of managers.  
That is not how the MNC functions outside India, but the P&L centre shows profit every year, so I guess the counterparts don't interfere.

Since I received the ""Notice period shortfall recovery email"" from HR in March 2019, I have been escalating the issue & seeking a waiver on it, since it was not my suggestion to have a 2 month notice period.

&#x200B;

HR Manager's manager had this overall input ""It is a *small* amount.. You should part ways on good note..""

The HR manager's manager borderline threatened me for the escalation with

""Do you want us to tell **this** when we get a call for background check anytime in the future?""

&#x200B;

He also mentioned, that this is the process they follow & ultimate discretion lies with management now.

So, I figured, it is pointless talking to him.*I did some digging and there was this IT/Systems in charge fellow who resigned recently. He served the notice period & for whatever reason, his manager let him go 2 days earlier, that too with a record on email.Still, he was asked to pay 2 days worth of notice period recovery amount, before his dues were cleared!!He paid it up since he was supposed to leave abroad for his next job & it was a small amount which he didn't want to hold up the larger settlement dues over that.*

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It simply blows my mind, that a company like such is actually hell bent on making money off notice period shortfalls, especially where the parting is mutual & hasn't even caused any business harm/loss or lack of transfer of work.

I absolutely do **NOT** want to pay the notice period shortfall.**How do I go about this?**

I was thinking about:

1. Writing to the ombudsperson (reporting helpline for intercompany disputes) - to get some global heat in this.
2. Writing about this to as many functional head & Global HR email addresses I can gather to just get this escalated so much, that it cannot be just pressed down.
3. Getting lawyer's opinion on this. (I would really like to avoid any legal proceeding, since that would call for a lot of work, time, money!)

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More details about communication/ Company structure/history/ in 1st comment.",do_mech,AskIndia," 1. I don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre liable to pay anything to the company, because your reporting manager was the one who provided the date for the termination of the contract.

2. If the HR manager is threatening to ‚Äòreveal‚Äô this in a background check, please inform him/her that doing so would be seen as an offence under IPC sections 499 and 500. Additionally, IPC 383 may also be applicable. Please check with a lawyer.

IMO, this is just a scare tactic to get you to pay

3. The company mentioned that it is a small amount. In that case they should be able to waive it.

4. Write an anonymous review of the company on Glassdoor. That should be sufficient warning for all current and future employees. Damn!
I thought it was only the Indie companies who were super rigged.
Even if it is an MNC, it looks equally as bad!

My 2 paisa-
Try talking to the centre head guy.
If that doesn't work, you need to get a bigger party in picture - Ombudsperson/Global attention. spam the management with polite complaints, someone in the ladder who has important things to do will waive this to make the 'insignificant' problem go away so that he can focus on his real job. idiotic HR just needs a word from top until then they will think they are the boss. > I want to pursue adventure sport of paragliding as a living.

will no one address the elephant in the room? Details:  


**Plan & communication.**

I have been discussing about a 1 year sabbatical since last March. That was not possible for my role, according to the Manager & the level-up Manager.

I also tried to check work-from-home / away possibility which was not pushed enough by my Manager either.

I then did inform them, last November about my intent to resign.

  
**Company structure/history/current**

I worked with a US based MNC (for 3 years). That was taken-over / merged with the European MNC giant.

The HR structure, the centre head (for Gujarat factory) we are talking about is the US-based-MNC structure.

Even through past 3 years, we have not yet completely gone on board of the Europe based company structure. So, it's kinda complex.

I still have the option to write to the Europe-based-structure HR chain / counterparts, but I doubt if they will have any say here.

  
**The Notice period recovery flag**  
The email communication shows my resignation & Manager-proposed date - being 2 months apart. No notice period was mentioned on the email by me or Manager, or the HRs in copy.  
The clearance process form does have a HR field which needs their input on Notice period/dues/others.  
The HR was not available the day of my relieving. The fields were not filled in earlier, either by them.

So, it turns out, this notice period is not flagged until, it is actually time for the Employee to pay it.  


**Rationale?** 

I tried my best to reason out, that the handover etc was done in order. My leaving 1 month sooner than the contract has not resulted in any business harm/loss, no process disruption. So, what is the ratinale for the recovery amount?  
Obviously, there was no answer to that. IANAL, but here is my view.

&#x200B;

1. If your manager proposed a LWD and you accepted it, it is binding. He does not have to explicitly say 'notice period is waived off'. The LWD means you are not supposed to be working after that date, and it can clearly be construed as the notice period being waived off. Please check your contract - I am sure there is a provision for the notice period getting shortened on mutual agreement between the employee and the company.
2. A bad reference is an empty threat. It opens up the company to a lot of legal problems. Unless the HR is crazy, they will not give you a bad reference.

3.    Any company worth its salt can write this off as a cost of doing business. 

&#x200B;

As long as you have the mail with the LWD, you should be good. It seems like the company is covering up for your manager's spinelessness.

&#x200B;

Please name and shame this company. Op I'm a lawyer. Have dealt with these kind of cases before. Send them a legal notice through a lawyer. You are absolutely correct in your assessment that you're not liable to pay anything. However, despite your stance being correct, pursuing a legal option will be rather long drawn and expensive for you. Rather I would suggest escalating the matter to your superiors and also the main head office (globally, not India). Take a strong stance and don't back down. Do loop in senior members/directors/managers who you have worked with in the past. They usually have the power to influence HR decisions. 

If nothing works, within 1-2 months, you can send them a legal notice. (This should be used as a scare tactic rather than as a predecessor to actual litigation, which you should try to avoid). Whether it is American or European company they had to still abide by the local laws (American or European working laws).

Just saying France passed a law that Manager cannot contact employee during weekend. 
There is mandatory labour working hours 37.5 hours / week. Your hours increases more than that then the company should have gotten a pre consent or part of contract.

My point is you can find number of times the company breached the contract terms . Both local and international.labour laws. You can state since company breached it's contract you are no longer bound to honour the contract The same thing happened to me when I left Accenture. I was relieved earlier and had to pay nothing extra. Go through the contract and see all the details. You got the final settlement / relieving paperwork that shows you have no dues.

Get most of the communication in emails.

If required ask the HR to involve the legal department. This makes the HR act cocky and realize that it can harm their reputation more than the employee‚Äôs.", WebCram needsinf0 dhakkarnia bobixdok do_mech sunny4649 _snorlax__ daaknaam gunnyise sushir madlabdog

Do you check Naukri? Monster? We have refer a friend program in our company. I think this might help you but they shortlist the resumes based on vacancies. DM me, I'll forward your resume to HR. Keep in mind that most of the vacancies have minimum 1 year experience requirement. Hey! If you want a well-paying job in the field of mechanical engineering right after you graduate/with less work-ex, you'll have to write the GATE exam and ace it! PSUs like IOCL, HPCL etc hire through GATE and pay around 12 LPA plus other perks if I'm not wrong. But you'll have to do really well in GATE to get into these coveted PSUs.


Other option would be to look into mechanical engineering companies. Pune would be the ideal location because many mechanical engineering companies are situated in and around Pune.

The pay won't be that high initally if you go for private sectors jobs in the field of mechanical engineering. I'm pretty sure you already know that.

Another option would be to work as a research assistant under a professor. The pay would be peanuts/no pay but you can build up a good profile and go for an MS later on(if possible).

Personally, I am proud of India because of its vibrant democracy. The way our country upholds individual human rights and provides us with the unparalleled rights safeguarded by our amazing Constitution, is something to be extremely proud of.

Similarly, what are your reasons to be proud of our beloved country?",_VmaX,AskIndia," Poverty is supposed to bring out the worst in people(and it has to a great extent) but so many of the poor are just honest, hard working, good people.

Innate Street smartness... Though that's just my observation... Potential! It makes me an optimist. There's so much more we can do in terms of developing ourselves as citizens, democracy, culture and so on and so forth! I usually use ATM's that don't suck my card in to do a transaction. 2 days ago, I used an ATM that clamped my card (didn't suck it in and didn't let me pull it out either (*It's not a sexual reference, pervert),* while I was trying to withdraw money. After the transaction, I absolutely forgot that my debit card was still in the slot and left it there. I realised that I left my card there only the next morning, almost 10 hours later. My first instinct was to transfer all my money online to another account. Then I wanted to block the card because I was 99% sure that my card wouldn't be there but I didn't because I thought I'll check the atm. I went to the atm, looked around and I was surprised to find that some kind stranger had left my card along with 2 other debit cards (looks like a frequent occurrence), on top of the atm machine and placed a white paper over it to cover it. It made me smile. In India and as Indians, we tend to get swallowed in by the hypocrisy of the mass media, religion, corrupt politicians etc and sometimes we focus on it so much that we think we live in a shit hole. We should all pause, look around and show some appreciation because people everywhere have their struggles and that we have more in common than the forces that want to divide us. P:S, Thank you kind stranger and I will pay it forward. Diversity

To be really honest, I feel that to have a sense of pride for your country to which you probably haven't contributed much to is stupid. However, I'm proud of us, the people. Given, there are a lot of people that aren't worth being proud of, but the vast majority of people/citizens/Indian origin people are achieving and doing things that give me a sense of identity which I feel I don't deserve. We are a country of simple, yet great people who have contributed so much to the world and that invokes a sense of pride. UPI and extensive digital services.

Unpopular Opinion: Children shouldn't be forced by their parents to touch the feet of their elders as a custom.,282,cdvkzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdvkzm/unpopular_opinion_children_shouldnt_be_forced_by/,156,1563304042.0,"Touching your elders' feet used to be a tradition to show them your respect, voluntarily. Now it is used as a unit to measure the value of a person as to how ""sanskari"" he/she is, and if they don't want to touch an elders' feet, they would be frowned upon by others and regarded as spoiled brats *by primarily their own parents*. Don't get me wrong, I do not, in any way, intend to eradicate this tradition, as it is sacred in our country and its importance should be taught to others but following it in order to show one's respect should be left to the person himself and not their parents. Moreover it leaves you guilty and awkward when you accidentally forget to touch an elders' feet and your parents instruct you to do so. Touching feet should be interchangable with a greeting like ""Namaste"" or ""nice to meet you"" and most importantly, should be an option (or atleast should come from within) rather than being a necessary obligation.",IAmTheFlash9,Non-Political," I'm from South India where this is not a norm. Was studying in UP in 9th std and the physics teacher actually made students to touch his feet when collecting answer paper. Felt weird but I went along with it. I agree to do it but the elder says - ""aarrey koi nahi , thik hai, iska kya jaroorat"".  Lmao.
Proud sanskari. I hardly bend down. üòÇ Did know this was still a popular practice. Never touched anyone's feet neither did my parents ask me to. Non of my cousins do that either and no one is bothered. Reminds me of that moment when 4 of us went to our friends place. The first three did namaste and the last bastard went and touched his parent's feet. In one fucking moment, we all looked un-sanskari. Needless to say, we don't hangout with that asshole anymore. I always make sure to touch my lovely and very, very supportive grandmother's feet in front of all the douchebag, judgemental and selfish uncles and aunts, and then just walk away. That way they know, you have to earn respect. bullying and public shaming are parenting tricks too... If your parent tells you to touch some elder's feet in front of them, and if you do touch the elder 's feet, your parent can feel proud for raising you with good manners and principles.

If you don't touch the damn elder's feet, your parent cannot be blamed as you will be thought of as asabhya launda. Your parent will be pitied for having such a delinquent child.

It's a win-win.

But it only works if the parent tells you to touch elder's feet in front of the elder-dunces. Definitely. Forcing someone to touch people's feet is absolutely ridiculous. Do it if you want to, but don't expect the same from me. Read about the japanese bows. A half bow is considered disrespectful, whereas a full bow is revered. Similarly, there are ways to communicate an elder person whether you really like them or not:


1) Actually touching feet - you actually respect the guy


2) Pretend to touch - you are in the safe zone


3) Namaste - if you don't know the person then its fine, if you know the person it is disrespectful


So if you say namaste, you'll not be really in the safe zone. Just say pranaam and move on, nobody will mind it. Correction. It isnt a pan Indian tradition. Its primarily a North Indian and may be West Indian tradition. This only happens in North India FYI, I am from Hyderabad and when I introduced my dad to my North friend he instantly touched his feet. I was like man, I have never done that my entire life. My 2 cents. never touched  any elders feet . parents used to be pissed off but they don't care now xD", wishicouldcode username-_-- nehru_ke_galti Baldie02 subtopewds609 james_lafleur2 InfiniteAgony iitian serentiynow I_see_Whales rekkker

Most of us middle class guys( without any generational wealth ) earning 30k-50k per month will never be financially independent in life.,743,c0isvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c0isvf/most_of_us_middle_class_guys_without_any/,617,1560539132.0,"This post is not for NRI randians who can easily convert their dollar bills to INR and can easily retire.   


This post is for middle class guys in their 20s earning 30k -50k per month without any generational wealth. 

The thing is that few people in india have some kind of leverage such as inheritance,land,multiple properties , assets etc. So middle class guys earning 30k-50k per month has to support themselves and  their family living in a different state .

&#x200B;

Every retirement calculator is showing that you need a corpus of 9-10 crore to retire if you in your 20s .

Unlike USA and other European countries ,Indian government doesnt provides social security for elderly people. Nearly 71% of senior citizens in India are dependent on their children for financial needs. Link given below.

[https://www.livemint.com/news/india/social-security-for-elderly-inadequate-in-india-un-report-1554292326814.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/social-security-for-elderly-inadequate-in-india-un-report-1554292326814.html)

So if you dont have 9-10 crore in assets in your 50s , you are basically fucked (assuming you are now in your early 20s). and 90% of indians will never be able to achieve this.

&#x200B;

I recently attended a stock market seminar in banglore and it was shit .I wasted 12000  inr. Most of the guys in the seminar were in their late 30s and 40s looking to find a 2nd income through stock market. Only few came to recover their losses .And the guy who was conducting the seminar told these people that they can easily earn 200% to 300% annually through stock market and most of them believed it. We all know that successful trader like PR Sundar are generating only 50% profit annually and this guy was saying that they can earn 300% annually. People have very unrealistic goals when it comes to stock market.

&#x200B;

Most people dont give a shit about their finances in their 20s and many of them make very poor decisions which turns deadly in their late 40s and 50s.Some of them will be forced to work till they die.

There are three major costs that are increasing faster than both wages  and inflation - healthcare, education, and real estate.  So financial independence becomes neccessary to achieve or your next generation might suffer.  Let me put it this way: without family money, your child may start off in a financial hole they can't climb out of. 

&#x200B;

My point is that  being born with a silver spoon is way more beneficial than not being born with one. It makes life more simpler.

Some of you will say get an MS and move abroad or invest in real estate. But I'd love a suggestion which doesn't involve inheritance and working abroad.",heisenberg005,Non-Political," Why you make me cry OP. Good thing I earn 51k every month That is why the best option is to lower our life expectancy. Why you gotta ATTACK me like that, OP. Don't have kids. Simple. I see my peers earning more than me being tied down with school fees and car EMIs and whatnot, poor guys are regretting getting married in the first place. Having children is not necessary to lead a fulfilling and happy life. *I recently attended a stock market seminar in banglore and it was shit .I wasted 12000 inr.*

The fact that you spent 12,000Rs for this seminar brings me to two points. First, you can gain any and all sort of knowledge by simply READING! Books on investing in the stock market are plenty and a simple search will reveal some really popular ones which could help you learn much MUCH more than any seminar. Even YouTube tutorials are a plenty! The same is applicable for any field to be honest.

The guy who conducted the seminar is the one who is on the path to financial independence. This is his hustle! How do you think he gained all the information/knowledge to give the seminar? My bet is he learnt it himself through reading/tutorials/actually investing on his own, whatever. By becoming proficient in one field he now charges 12K from people to learn what he knows. Answer me this, if this guy is sooo good that he's conducting seminars, don't you think he can make MUCH more money by actually investing in the stock market than conducting seminars? I would bet that he makes 80% of his income from these seminars and 20% from the stock market. The importance of hustling or a secondary source of income is underrated!

You could very well make money in the stock market but you would have to spend money irrespective. You have spent 12k for the program. Others have spent 12k by being in it, losing money through maybe 4 or 5 wrong investments, and learning from their losses. Both are valid forms of learning, but who has learnt more? The guy who has 4-5 mistakes to learn from, right?

As long as you are reliant on your 9-5 job you will find it very tough to be financially independent. You need a secondary source of income, whether passive or active. The options and possibilities are endless, but you WILL have to get out of your comfort zone to actually get there. I seriously feel that couples who cannot pass on financial wealth to their kids should not be having kids. And this mostly sounds like a far off dream considering that people have kids even when they don‚Äôt have the money to feed themselves. It‚Äôs unfair to bring a human being into this world and expect them to pull you out of your rut. It‚Äôs too much pressure and nobody deserves it.

I‚Äôm in a similar situation currently, got educated on a loan somehow. Have paid off the education loan but there are other loans on my dad which I‚Äôm in the process of paying. Mom wants a house and they have 0 savings literally. Which means I need to save up for that. To top it all, they want me to have a grand wedding. This is something I plan on not giving them though. 

It‚Äôs going to be like this, taking care of them through their old age while trying to save for my old age. 

The only good thing that‚Äôs come out of this mess is that I‚Äôve chosen to be childfree. That feels like a load off!

Thanks for reading my little bit of a rant. Wow. I'm not even earning 30k man. Bhai Mechanical wale bhi hai yahan. 30k zyada ho gaya zara. The Starting Salaries of Engineering graduates at most MNC's is under 30k pm, so almost ALL of India starts at this level. Over the next 10 years, you will get to 1L ATLEAST, and that too if you stick to one company and do not job-hop. Thats still nets you compounded 12% growth per year minimum. Assuming inflation at 6%, thats you outpacing it at 6% PA.

Basic Life Tip: It is ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE you get medical Insurance for parents and self and make sure you get yearly checks done for parents past the age of 50. Nothing erodes middle class savings like health issues detected too late.

Start saving 10% of your income monthly when you feel you have reached a comfortable threshold of income - it varies from person to person, but a good time to start is at age 25. Life is a long boring grind, but stick to it and you will get to a significant corpus by the time you retire, enough to take care of you in your last years, even if you do nothing remarkable in your entire life.

If you do end up doing something remarkable along the way you may double/triple that corpus easily and you may even leave your kids some inheritance.

On a positive note, none of this may even matter and we needn't care about kids since we may all be dead by 2040 the rate at which the planets going.

**Note:** 12k on that seminar? Seriously bro? Even before it started, you had already flushed your money. Are you a middle aged property broker looking for a change??? Pro Tip - If you are savvy enough to use Reditt, you NEVER need to spend a dime on ANY seminar - there is nothing those seminars will teach you that a few clicks on the Internet wont. ~~9 to 10 crores??? You want to live on 40 lpa in retirement?? You're supposed to earn enough so that 4% of you're assets support you for 1 year. Also you're supposed to earn more and more as you age.~~

Save Water,2042,c61bru,https://i.redd.it/mlq1vmig0u631.png,151,1561640715.0,,Anti_PSycho,Non-Political," This is Okay in my opinion in terms of water saving but the hardened water from RO will not wash your clothes properly. You will need to add more of washing powder to achieve the required amount of lather (foam). If this is your home OP, i would suggest to use this hard water from RO in flushing toilets or cleaning the porch/balcony. Semi-relevant question, is hard water okay for machine use? It definitely has chewed through the inlet attachment or atleast its screws in a year or two. Will it harm the machine internals?

Edit: I've recently rented a house and the tap for municipal water is huge so have to use the tap with underground water. Just wanna know if it's not harmful. I have tried so many things with this waste water but it just fucks up everything. Storing this in a bucket makes it all white and salts makes it even hard to clean. I used it in my cooler and pipe got jammed after some time. I tried cleaning but it makes it even more dirty. I tried washing my scooty with it and wallah, my black scooty got white. I guess water in my area is really bad. To all those worried about hardness: RO reject, at least hardnesswise, is nothing but a 30-50% harder version of your regular water you're injecting into the RO. So if the inlet water isn't too hard, the reject water isn't too hard either. It might not be useful for other than flushing in some places (like Bangalore, in my experience), but in some places it seems to work great, because the regular water isn't very hard and hence the RO reject is safe for most things too. That's hard water. You sure you want to wash clothes with that? wouldn't a front load washing machine save more water in longer run? also, can the water purifier push the discarded water to a height greater than itself? I guess it can based on this image. Is that discarded water okay to use for washing? I think I remember reading somewhere that it is not. We have a similar arrangement in my house. The RO reject water is collected in a drum and that is used for washing utensils. Has worked out well so far. Not all heroes wear capes Can anyone explain what's going on here? Had planned something similar, but since it couldn't happen, I have a 20L bottle under my RO, which I pour into my washing machine regularly.

1) These foreigners , i don't think, are aware of the amount of time people put in for JEE.They think 'woah, such a difficult question.how on earth are 17 - 18 yr olds gonna solve this?'.But let me assure you : serious candidates have practiced much harder sums than warranted.The candidates have already gone through very difficult mocks(see fiitjee test series).At that stage, the difficulty shouldn't surprise them.

2)Nobody is obliged to attempt the whole paper including the difficult questions(she keeps harping about that  2016 physics question(two discs and we had to compute the z component of angular momentum or something)Every jee paper has freebies and we were advised to go after the easy ones , fight it out for the grey ones and leave the 
difficult ones alone. Blame India‚Äôs population and the consistent apathy of successive governments towards creating institutes of repute other than IITs. Again, Indians looking for white people's validation. [removed] Remember the Oxford guy who reportedly solved the paper in one third the time and received death threats? JEE is something that needs to be scrapped or atleast needs a huge overhaul imo. If you want to check someones aptitude for computer science how does testing them on Chemistry or even Physics make any sense at all? An exam that tests your Math, Logical reasoning and Maybe some fundamental concepts of CS  makes so much more sense.  Hell testing their communication skills makes more sense. Being able to rote learn tonnes of inorganic chemistry does not indicate a higher aptitude for CS.  Having a common exam for all branches in it's own seems like a flawed idea and when you top it off with the amount of depth a student needs to study in a completely unrelated subject, it's just a bad bad system that's  going to leave a lot of burnt out kids who essentially devoted their two most important formative years to something that won't contribute or be useful in their lives ever again. You are not even creating a filter that gives you the best students for a branch, you're just testing something unrelated and patting yourselves on the back saying 'We have the toughest entrance exams in the world'. This exam kills your skills as well as talent. What people do get after good rank in JEE??? Just a seat in IIT or to show-off your rank, college with relatives.

For this giveaway, I selected the book which was much requested since our first Giveaway:

**Brave New World by Aldous Huxley**

On BNW: 1984, Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451 are widely celebrated as the trilogy of authoritarian warning. They are also the most banned books. When you put it in historical context and realize that Huxley's magnum opus was published in 1932 - when Fascism was on the rise in Europe and just before World War II started -  before many of the ideas that Huxley explores were even developed as they are today, it makes it even more of an astounding read. It's a bit disturbing how accurate a book written in the 1930's has been. Also, I think it can be paired with Mill's Utilitarianism to get a good idea.

It takes place in an advanced future where humans are cloned, socially indoctrinated and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian order. It is a remarkable piece of literature in that it deals with a world that is genetically engineered and could become a reality. 
What makes this novel so powerful; it‚Äôs not unbelievable. There‚Äôs just enough truth within Brave New World for it to be real. It‚Äôs a cruel mirroring of our own existence, should we follow a certain path too strongly. 
Nationalism, Jingoism, Xenophobia, Fascism, Authoritarianism, Totalitarianism, Separatism, Isolationism...how subtly they are intertwined, with much accountability.

Quotes from the book:
> ‚ÄúBecause our world is not the same as Othello‚Äôs world. You can‚Äôt make flivvers without steel and you can‚Äôt make tragedies without social instability. The world‚Äôs stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can‚Äôt get. They‚Äôre well off; they‚Äôre safe; they‚Äôre never ill; they‚Äôre not afraid of death; they‚Äôre blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they‚Äôre plagued with no mothers or fathers; they‚Äôve got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they‚Äôre so conditioned that they practically can‚Äôt help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything should go wrong, there‚Äôs soma. Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn‚Äôt nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.‚Äù 

> ‚ÄúBut I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.‚Äù 

> ‚ÄúI ate civilization. It poisoned me; I was defiled. And then,"" he added in a lower tone, ""I ate my own wickedness.‚Äù

> Log in to you Amazon.in account.

> Go to 'Your Account' > 'Your Addresses' > Click on Add Address > Save your full address including your mobile number > Save > Click on 'Set as Default' to make that address your default [This is important]

> Now Create a WishList, it should be Public and not Shared. Remember to check the box that says 'Third Party Shipping Agreement', when you make the list.

> Now search for the title of the book, and add the book to the same Public WishList.

> And you're done!

After you're done with setting up your Gift Registry:

* You first need to request for the book by commenting on this post, so to get visibility, and I can add you to my list from there. This way I get to manage list of requests in a sequence.
* Now you need to DM me your WishList link. Please don't copy the invite link, you need to copy the WishList link from 'Send list to others' button or directly from URL :)
* I'll try to fulfill every request made here. I won't send the book to users who created the account on same date, because that is just abusing the system. 

The eBook version is also freely available to read in the Archives! Here are the links:

Did you find any sponsors? You are very kind. Thank you for this. Thats one fucking glorious beard bro Thanks for the recommendation, will read the ebook. I have heard of this , idk how I missed the previous giveaways , but looking at the enthusiasm here and the past threads , I see it is real.

You mad lad , you really do send random strangers on the internet books , with your own money , no strings attached. Why? There must be a good reason for this. Why books? Why on r/India? Why do you do this?


Also, I have added plenty of books on my wish list over the years, I plan to buy them all once I can afford them. Do I need to delete them all and add only this book? Or do you personally look at the list and place the order? As long as you don't use a script or an automated method I hope it will be okay?  Dmed. 


I would be happy with just the book , but I would be happier if I know why you do this, you madlad, you. If I am not mistaking you are the one who sent me Fyodor's Crime and Punishment. It was a fun read. 

This helped me understand his character and ability (still mysterious) from Bungou Stray Dogs better Man I love what you are doing but I think it would be better if you donate the books to public libraries in your city or schools than give to redditors here who I feel can afford the book. You even gave the free soft copy which people can take to read here. Guys don't take the kindness of a guy for granted. Take this post as a indication of a good book to read but don't ask for it if you know you can afford it. I read this book after I read your copy of Animal Farm. Thank you for what you do! I have read the soft copy of this book. üòäüëåüëç I have already read it, sadly I lost my copy.

"Indian men have a problem, they hate condoms. This is what it results in",97,cc5p10,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/indian-men-have-a-problem-they-hate-condoms-this-is-what-it-results-in-1566806-2019-07-11,172,1562931716.0,,ppatra,Non-Political," This article may be targetting individuals who are married and are not using any family planning. But our youth is educated. They are using condoms. No way this study include youths who can't risk to be pregnant and get infected by STDs. Condom use has increased and is prevalent in Indian youth. > This national distaste for condoms is despite markets being flooded with strawberry, litchi, banana, peach, chocolate, pan, aam panna, kaccha aam, dotted, extra dotted, feather light, ultra thin, lubricated, super lubricated and tens of other varieties and designs prepared by brands these days to make condoms appealing.

I'm still waiting for [Biryani](https://mobile.twitter.com/manforceindia/status/1112685730461941761) flavour. Wouldn't put anything else. /s I'm a virgin, and even I use condoms for mastrubation. People have wrong information about condoms, and a lot of them refuse to wear it, putting solely the burden on Ipills. I have an issue with sensitivity. 
As in, I am not sensitive enough. It's really bad.. I can hardly keep a boner due to the lack of stimulation. 
Using a condom feels like I am swinging my dick in air. When people actively oppose sex education then this trend is likely to happen. Vasectomy can be a great option, if you are sure you are not looking for babies, or you dont want children. 

Problem is most of us, have very limited idea about contraceptive options for young people. Why would you even use condoms as the family planning measure when superior options are available? Tha author has not even looked at the stats and goes on about population and STDs. The TFR of Andhra, Telengana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu are below 2, which is lesser than the replacement rate. Bihar is the only outlier here. The question of burden on men for family planning should be asked with respect to male sterilization, not condom use. BC problem is condom comes in all types of varieties and sizes except which fits my dick. What bullshit. Every man hates condoms. Any guy who's done it with and without, knows how much better without is. But since most girls in India aren't on birth control tablets, condoms are a must for guys. And the flavours are for oral sex, dimwits, not to make it more appealing to men (unless if it's two guys, of course).

EDIT: Dumbasses who think I meant emergency pills - NO, I did not. Long term birth control pills (Ortho-Novum etc in the US, not sure about brands in India) actually lessen periods and any minor side effects go away in a month or two. Jeez, India really, really needs sex education. The flavoured condoms are for oral sex not vaginal or anal. I hope that this writer know this which i seriously doubt he does the way he writes the article like a child.

Condom are for sex between strangers and used primarily as means to stop STD, they are by no means tools for family planning. In india we use sterilization as a better and more permanent solution. We don't have one night stand or sex culture of west so we don't meed them much in the first place. Our TFR is already approaching 2.1 overall and if taken separately by communities then even lower, only muslim community TFR is a cause concern. 

I don't get the points of this article and it feels like it was written by buzzfeed writer.

Whenever a girl/boy reaches the so-called marriageable age these morons start with their preaching about how marriage gives happiness, how kids are important (look at our population damn you) etc etc. 

It is like a vicious cycle. These people pressurize the parents, the parents in turn pressurize their children, and some of them give in unable to withstand the mental torture. 

And no, it doesn't stop at marriage. 

Once marriage is over they start with the next one- oh when are you having kids? This time the pressure point is from two sides (both from one's parents and one's in-laws).

And if you criticize them, then it is - oh they are older than you, you should listen to them. 

This whole culture of not questioning the elders is so toxic and has led so many people to making life choices they otherwise would never have made. 

And has a part in the current situation of the country stemming from overpopulation.. (I would love to see the results in case someone does study this). 

People marrying without being ready, people having kids before they are ready sinking into debts, people ostracized over being single - the list is too long. 

This unaccounted for social pressure is a damage to the nation, its people. It is high time it is stopped.",bhaagmodibhaag,Non-Political," I'm guessing you're at the first stage of being pressurized into tying the knot.

We need to realise that at the end of the day, we are the ones who'll have to live with the decisions we make. 

Not your mom, your dad or well-meaning relatives but only you. I try to keep this in mind while taking decisions and have been content so far. Can't agree more. I'm 22 years old, in final year of Engineering. My dad passed away this year in March due to Cancer. Now there is only me and mom. After that relatives kehne lage, ""Shaadi karlo tum, padhai to hoti rahegi"" and some started giving me career advice and what not. After that I realised that ""Jab baap nai hota tab sab baap banane jate hai"". I was harassed in a recent wedding by a complete stranger who was looking to matchmake his daughter. Guy wouldn't take a hint (kept following me around) when I repeatedly told him I wasn't interested. I finally cracked, told him that I was gay and asked him if he had a son. That shut him up quickly üòâ OP I went to Uzbekistan recently with my wife and even the hotel receptionist and owner asked us why we don't have kids yet

So whatever you think is bad, can always be worse! Well, we all are gonna die anyway because of no water in the coming years. This is why I think moving out is very important. After you're done with your qualifications, you need to move out of your parents or joint family's house. Whether that be on rent or ownership. 

""An eagle which doesn't leave it's nest, eventually becomes a Turkey."" The quicker you attain autonomy after being financially secure, the better. These aunties need a *Stone Cold Stunner* We can quite those well-being relatives, but what do you tell your parents? They must ask about your future plans too? Do you deflect the question, or did you try having an honest conversation with them? Do they understand your point of view? Yeah. I feel you.. 

I decided a long time back that I was never having children. But do you think they care about what I want? 

I'm unmarried. My mother keeps saying ""I'm getting old. When will you get married and give me grandchildren to play with? ""

She works as a teacher, so I told her to go play with her students and not ask me to give her crotchfruit just because she wants someone to play with. Tell them to stfu (politely of course). Tell them you have grand visions that they do not understand and are possibly too stupid to understand. Explicitly detail them being stupid with detailed explanations.

Stop living with the idea that educating your relatives or acquaintances is rude. They have power only as much you provide.

This method only works if you have your patents completely on your side and fully kniw of your visions or goals. Possessive parents? I am sorry for you. Adoption needs to be advertised now.

Calling out Instagram Scammers,313,ce93yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ce93yt/calling_out_instagram_scammers/,58,1563373820.0,"It's one of my favorite activities since the people behind these are not that smart to begin with. You would have seen such pages. The most recent one I outed was during the IPL where the page had multiple posts and stories showing ""proof"" of the earnings he had given his clients in the Rs.30,000-70,000 range. His MO? On paying him Rs 2000, he gives you ""Optimum"" Dream11 team, using which you are guaranteed winnings of 20,000+. 

A common red flag for these pages is the disabling of comments on the posts. All communication is via DM only. So, me being me, I slide into them DMs and start inquiring about the hows and whats of the deal, as a genuine customer. They begin their pitch, sell it, and then ask for payment. 9 times out of 10, payment is via UPI/PayTM, and hence linked to a mobile number. A quick TruCaller search reveals the name and identity of the person running the scam. I then send them a DM saying that I have complained to the cyber cell about their scam and they should be getting a call soon. At this point they think I'm bluffing, usually get on the offensive and start abusing me while giving blind threats. I then address them by their  full name, mention their address (it's unbelievable how easy it is to find information on FB), and state that these details have been submitted to the CyberCell. 

Two hours later, the Instagram account is usually deleted and no longer found.

And I honestly feel more than half of it is hidden cam porn. And also, I recently learned that there are accounts which post semi nude/nude pics of Indian women and the tharki Indian men comment just whatever vulgar shit that comes in their mind. Once the account has enough followers/engagement, they just sell the account. I have personally reported idk how many accounts but Instagram just gives me the we reviewed the account but couldn't find anything wrong with this account shit. you sir are fighting the good fight ! You're the hero we need, but don't deserve! I usually do this with email scammers.

When they say they have gold chests or their uncle's money, I say I am OK with receiving them. Then they ask to pay for the transfer charges or custom charges. I create a fake moneygram or western union receipt (online tools to generate this) and send them. Try to fool the same person multiple times with these receipts. Then they stop replying.

For phishing emails, there is a web service called [phishtank](https://www.phishtank.com/) where you can report such mails. ""Pay me X so you can make XXX"" is like the easiest sign of a scam. If you could make 20,000 in Dream XI team every time, why wouldn't you just make the team yourself lmao

If someone is asking for money so you can make money, they'd ask for it after the result and they'd ask for a percentage of it - like fund managers Ayy... Desi James Veitch! Good work OP! What a great idea!  Using the UPI/PayTM phone number is a great tool u/domxss Once a wise man said

As a huge fan of Asian films, especially those in the samurai genre from directors like Kurosawa and Kobaiyashi, I started collecting samurai manga like Lone Wolf and Cub, Vagabond, Blade of the Immortal etc. Within two years of collecting, my tastes in manga became even more defined just like my tastes in music and films and the pic below features my entire collection as of today.

Yes, [small collection but not a complete one.](https://i.imgur.com/GXOvFZZ.jpg) 

I got City Hunter vol. 3 and 4 few days ago and it is the most prized one because 

a. Possible first edition print- December 2003 according to the entry inside

b. the company publishing it went defunct in 2004. English volumes are incomplete. 

[HQ image of front cover](https://i.imgur.com/VfS6Jqc.jpg). Getting volume 1 will be the super difficult since it is out of circulation and is being sold at a highly inflated rate by collectors. Both the manga and the mangaka are super popular in France though and they have complete official French translations. Shayad future mein French editions kharid lunga saari.  

**Tip- in India, mangas can be purchased from amazon.in and sapnaonline but the library is small. Sapnaonline has the best rate for some while Amazon has bad and vice versa.**

Good Collection OP! I buy a lot of second hand manga and I don't have enough space in my room to keep it all :p I wanted to start collecting manga but the prices in India are a bit too high. More than 1000 for a single volume is a lot. But I still intend to start collecting once I start earning and will start with vagabond. Finally someone who owns Incal :) My collection is more graphic novels than manga, and sadly limited to one rack. I have a good collection of sci fi n others though. Awesome collection man. Among yours I only own an Akira and All you need is Kill, and the moebius dude, get yourself **Berserk hardcover Deluxe Editions**. You won't regret it.

I am more into sci-fi and prefer short manga. So, in manga I mostly have:

All you need is kill

Planetes Omnibus 

Astroboy Omnibus Vol 5

Ghost in the Shell

Death Note Black Edition (missing half of the series)

Bakuman vol 1

Grantz Vol 1 and 2

Batmanga vol 1,2,3

Batman: Child of Dreams Man, I can spend an eternity reading all those and not even regret it I don't really have a way to display them, but I have a bunch:

1. CCS omnibus edition
2. Death note box set
3. FMA box set
4. Ouran box set

Kabir Singh: It's Not A Love Story or A Cinema; It's A Barbaric Decimation of Femininity (1/5),239,c4hb9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c4hb9i/kabir_singh_its_not_a_love_story_or_a_cinema_its/,323,1561373725.0,"This could have been an epic love story, the movie which everyone who has ever fallen in love, or God forbid, plans to fall in love, should watch. The modern-day Devdas, or the new revamped DDLJ, which forces you to use that tissue paper in the darkness of the theater.

But alas. All this movie ends up is insulting, objectifying women like no other movie has done in recent times.

Imagine a girl, a fresher just entering the college she has slogged off for, and the senior coming to the class and declaring that she is 'his girl', and no one should look at her. Picking her up from the class to teach her anatomy in the woods, and slapping her when she asks him to respect her dad.

The character, Kabir Singh is a sadist, horny sexist, who treats her girl like an object, a property who can be twisted and tweaked the way men want.

The concept of consent and romance has been killed to show how masculine the character is and being a chauvinist and a misogynist is glorified.

And the biggest problem was the hooting and shouting and whistling on some of the cringe-worthy scenes (the hero trying to rape pointing a knife to a girl, who is not even his girlfriend), in an otherwise decent crowd of movie-lovers in Pune.

I can't even imagine the effect this movie will have in states like UP and Bihar.

Cinema does have a responsibility and screwed up movies like these can play havoc with the minds of young male teens, who are about to encounter the beautiful concept of love.

It's not a love story, neither a cinema. Its a barbaric decimation of femininity.

Eagerly waiting for them. worst part about all of this - my name is Kabir Singh. 1/5 ? ain't nobody got time for that /s Unfortunately for India, in this case, Oscar Wilde's quote is tragically relevant: **Life imitates Art** far more than **Art imitates Life.** So it adapted the source material perfectly. Glad people are seeing the actual story it tells. Arjun Reddy has a cult following (the movie it was based on). I said this when the original came out. Will say this again. Movies like these make it seem like toxic masculinity is an ok thing and gets people (espcially in the younger minds) to believe  that such behaviour is not just ok, but glorified. Our film certification board is busy censoring kisses while movies like these are the actual reason people's mentalities are so fucked up. **nothing new then. classic bollywood.** Arjun reddy in itself was cringe-worthy. Couldn't go past 30 minutes of it. No wonder the adaptation is a snooze fest. Where are the feminists now? > And the biggest problem was the **hooting and shouting and whistling on some of the cringe-worthy scenes** (the hero trying to rape pointing a knife to a girl, who is not even his girlfriend), in an otherwise decent crowd of movie-lovers in Pune.

How can the god hear the song ? I bet they don't even understand it, busted Rammstein this morning then googled the translation to be better. I live in Kolkata - the apartments used to Bengali majority. Most of their children have moved to the US and Canada, so they have sold their apartments and moved with them or moved to cheaper places in the city because they are in the country only half the year.       

Gradually the demography changed. There was insistence of using the empty space for making a temple. Now there is a temple in middle of the open space where a lot of us grew up playing football. Some of these temple associated people suggested that we respect the temple in the premises and stop the mutton that we eat during Durga Pujo because the Pujo pandal is next to the temple.      

I had objections with the temple on two issues - 1. Football is more important than religion. 2. There will be issues later because the space is a common one.         

Eventually more Bengali families left the colony as the prices around the area increased. They moved further towards South Kolkata and as I predicted, point 2 happened. North Indian Muslims bought the newly sold apartments and then wanted a prayer hall and the colony union would not relent.    

Eventually problem died down but the colony union decisions are now divided not by who gets to steal union money (which was honestly a more secular approach now that I think of it!) to political and religious lines.    
  
Who the fuck suffered ? My fat 32 year old ass who has to rent astro turfs to play football or pray that the Jadavpur University students are in a good mood and let us play there in the evening.       

Moreover the mosque close to the colony and the temple inside it are in a competition every morning to create a ruckus. There are times I am okay with the Azan and arti. I actually am fond of listening to both in the evening. Its also a time people are out and playing. Makes sense! But the mosque and the temple have no sense of decorum in the morning. Neither were there mikes during mohammed's time nor any during ram's time. Stop using science and technology to spread rubbish which denounces science and technology. More importantly - let me sleep! I face this with a mosque nearby.

This will be a meme for sure. So all 15 th August plan cancelled !!! Post the K-wave, West had its golden era of TV which is still on-going.  
India sort of went in an interesting way post 80s. TV wasn't dominant but it wasn't small either. And then it become irrelevant and Bollywood just became too big.  

India has enough of a market to sustain TV market. It just needs a certain quality and that requires some examples which work and SG did that because it has roped in major stars.  
If other stars start doing it it will open up the sector. 

That is if everything does well. 
Movies are not improving, maybe TV shows is where quality might appear because of the platform dynamic, bad quality products rarely survive while due to the nature of Theater/Screen growth in India it means Movie Producers don't have to care about quality that much, they can just ride the underlying growth wave and with massive marketing make up enough money in 3 weeks and be gone.

Writing this for more clarity (copy pasting comments -mine and another user comment)

Why?

1. If the guy is an obsessive one (I'm not saying you are, I am just outlining the fears), he might stalk, threaten, or in extreme cases even pour acid on her face. 
2. She might be branded prude, uptight etc. 
3. She might get constant messages from the guy if she says a no (i don't know why but guys seem to take it like a personal challenge if a girl says no)
4. Her friendship with the guy might be affected, and she still wants the person as a friend. 
5. Some guys turn completely hateful if a girl says no. They bitch about her to other guys, send her hateful messages etc. So to protect her peace. 

Source: I told a guy no more than ten years back and I got messages even last year after I had blocked him everywhere tired of harrassment.. Also every girl I know has some version of the above points.

My story. 

(12 years)
He initially asked me in 10th. I said no many times. After going to college I dismissed it (I mean kids have crushes) But no. Dude pesters me again. I again say no. 

This on off things continues. Then last year he somehow texted me, saying he wants to marry me, will ask my hand to parents etc.

I was so terrified I just blocked him again. 



A comment in response to mine:

>5. Some guys turn completely hateful if a girl says no. They bitch about her to other guys, send her hateful messages etc. So to protect her peace. 


Yikes. Been on the receiving end of this recently. And boy oh boy! Did he lose it? The way he reacted, you would think something snapped inside him. It was like he came undone, and suddenly I was dealing with this vitriol-spewing piece of a shit who would twist every single thing he knew about me in the most grotesque way possible to try and get back at me, all because he got turned down. I still can't for the life of me fathom how fucked does someone have to be inside to be that bitter. Never in a million years would I have ever imagined he had this side to him. 

Suffice to say that I have learners my lesson since this incident. Saying no? Never again.

<Comment end>


For men it is a question of love life. For us it is a question of life. 

The first reaction to a request from a guy is fear (if the girl is not interested). Is he going to stalk? Is he going to threaten me? Is he going to ruin my reputation? 

So we prefer keeping quiet because silence is better than saying no and earning his wrath. 

If a girl does not say a yes, then most likely it is a no and you need to let go.

This is also why we prefer saying 'I have a boyfriend' even if we don't have because men respect other men more than they respect us. 

Please stop blaming women for not saying no...we do not have a choice. It is a huge risk for us.

Edit: I thought of adding this after some comments.

I have only written about the possibility where the girl does not like the guy. She may resort to a direct no/silence/lies because of all these reasons. 

I don't know why it should be taken as 'girls should propose then' and 'I will not propose anymore'. 

The girl would say yes if she's interested in you (unless she is playing hard to get-in which case you need to introspect whether you need that kind of girl in your life)...

And no,most girls are not going to take the initiative and ask guys out (again because of the risk factor). 

I know this is a depressing post, but I wanted to highlight why it is scary to say a no.

Edit 3: Many thanks for the gold, kind stranger. Didn't expect that. 

Also to clarify on point 4. 

I have written it as a reason why girls do not say no. I haven't said that it is a right thing to do.

Also this is not a post about boys vs. girls or men vs. women. This is simply to highlight a risk that is very relevant specially here. While the same thing happens globally we cannot ignore that the magnitude is higher in India. 

Majority of women go through this and that's what I wanted to say.",bhaagmodibhaag,Non-Political," I'm sorry you had to go through that, Bollywood movies are to be blamed for it. They literally teach us that harassment is ok kabira is sansar mein bhanti bhanti ke log,   
Kuch to madarchod, kuch bhut hi madarchod. I think the whole stalking till loved point of view emphasised in Indian films generates this attitude in uncivilized men One my old flatmates, when in college, got asked out by a guy in her friends circle. She turned him down in no uncertain terms. Cue stalking and emotional blackmail and turning her friends against her. 

After few weeks of this he committed suicide and mentioned her name in his suicide note. She got into a lot of trouble with the police for abettment of suicide, name splashed over newspapers and everything. Had to pay hefty bribes to stay out of legal trouble. She was ostracized by all her classmates. Luckily managed to convince college management not to expel her.

Fast forward few years later, and she keeps getting into relationships with abusive guys who emotionally blackmail her with suicide everytime they have a difference of opinion. Me an introvert: What the fuck? do guys just randomly approach a girl they saw and ask them to go to places with them? I'd  rather be dead before going and talking to a stranger, that too a woman, especially in India.  Fuck, I'd die if some unknown girl approached me to ask out. I would freak the fuck out and will probably dial 911 or something. ""This is why we prefer saying 'we have a boyfriend' because men respect other men more than they respect us""

This shit is so true and so on point. This is highly toxic This happens all the time - unless you belong to that small enlightened crowd that is slowly increasing.

The reason for this is two-fold, I think. Entitlement (thanks to parents and society that have told them they deserve anything they want) and insecurity (a 'no' makes them think that the girl thinks something is wrong with them - looks, brains, confidence. Not man enough. And an insecure person reacts to that by getting angry at the girl who made him think so). Ah yes, typical /r/niceguys syndrome THANK YOU FOR THE POINT ABOUT GUYS RESPECTING OTHER GUYS MORE THAN OUR NO. 

I wear a ring 90% of the time so I can tell people I'm engaged even when I'm not.  

I've had to say ""I have a boyfriend"" When I didn't (this was when I was 14 and the guy who was pestering me was 21. I should've reported him as a pedophile. I didn't. My mistake). He stopped bugging me when I told him I liked only girls and not boys. I'm sorry you had to go through all that. I agree it is disgusting that guys keep pestering women after being turned down.

2 months later a few people on 3 bikes came over the boy's place and broke through the house while they were having dinner.

The boy was then beheaded in front of his family

"BSNL may shut down: It has no money to pay employees, all you need to know about BSNL crisis",210,c5l7r3,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/bsnl-may-shut-down-it-has-no-money-to-pay-employees-all-you-need-to-know-about-bsnl-crisis-1556217-2019-06-26,207,1561552583.0,,ppatra,Non-Political," Reposting my comment from last time:

This is such a bad sign for India. We are so heavily dependent on BSNL that a life without them at this point seems unimaginable to me. 

Let me put this into perspective, while a large chunk of BSNLs business is consumer centric, an extremely large chunk is business to business. 

At the moment some of their largest clients in the country are large organizations like SBI, IDBI, HPCL, BPCL, ONGC, etc and in the private sector as well. BSNL has an extremely large reach in terms of their links which allow these state run and privately run businesses to connect their IT infrastructure. These links are MPLS links, P2P links, ILL links, broadband, VSAT, etc. Basically anything that allows the users/employees to connect to the organizations core datacentre. 


The reasons for this are:

A. Afaik it's easy for PSU's to give business to BSNL because they don't have to go through a very time consuming RFP process and orders can be directly placed onto BSNL

B. BSNL has an unimaginable reach. They exist in places where frankly no one else does. It could be the Himalayas or the North East or Thar or whatever. BSNL is basically everywhere. Where nothing exists, you'll still find BSNL. What this means is that sometimes, they are frankly the only option for many businesses that have a remote presence in tier 3 or tier 4 cities or even villages. It is very rare to find a private player like tcl, sify or vodafone in these areas. Thus businesses have no option but to work with BSNL. 

So BSNL is a mammoth which basically is providing a very crucial service to our nation. And at the same time, BSNL not existing is a very dangerous scenario because: 

A. Many many places will go unserviced because they just won't have connectivity. Without connectivity it'll be very difficult for the businesses to operate in those areas. Example: a SBI ATM won't be able to connect to the core data center. If it can't connect, it won't be able to access information, thus won't be able to perform it's operations meaning that it won't dispense money, or show the balance, etc because it just won't have the ability to get that information. The people living in these areas will suffer badly. Imagine a poor migrant worker sending money home but their family not being able to take the money from the machine or from the branch. 

B. If BSNL goes out of business, most organizations will have a mammoth task of changing their links from BSNL to another player like Tata or Sify or Airtel. Changing one single link takes around 1.5 months of processing time. Sometimes more. Imagine changing hundreds of thousands at the same time. It'll be chaos, prices will go up a lot, and we just won't be able to service it. It's an extremely daunting task. We'll be lucky if we are able to change a small percentage of the links. This will definitely have an operational as well as heavy commercial impact

Although I would say that with the improvements in technology and the pervasiveness of Reliance Jio, this scenario could be countered. However it will still be extremely difficult because 4G technology just isn't that trustworthy at the moment in India. It's better than nothing granted but it's really not that great. We're going for near perfection in our operations whereas 4G comes with basically no guarantees. It's an extremely large drop in quality of service levels despite the party being compared to being BSNL. And it also doesn't change the fact that infrastructure will have to be changed at a very large scale. Simply because most places that'll be affected arent geared at all for 4G. They just don't meet the minimum requirements to be able to use 4G technology because most of their routers aren't capable of using 4G. Cisco has now started producing these 4G capable routers but most remote locations don't have these and thus will require a change in the device. 

So if BSNL goes out of business, which it just might cos it's debt is really just that high and it's a very poorly run business albeit a critical one but still a poorly run business, we'll be in a world of pain. I hope the government makes some reforms which aid the situation. Or even better I wish a private player takes them over for their existing operations although considering how much debt the telecom sector already has, I doubt any player would want to take on BSNL's as well. It's just really damn high. 


To sum it all up, imagine demonitization but now it affects not just the banking industry but also oil, health, education, public services, etc. It's painful to even think about it.

Edit: Removed the part about other telcos taking bandwidth from BSNL. [deleted] Why are all government businesses failing?! BSNL has more than 1.6 lakh employees - no government, not even this one has the guts to do that. There'll be unimaginable rioting, so I think this story is rushing to conclusions. Any shut down will have to happen over twenty plus years, they are still closing down Hindustan photo films, which has been a terrible loss maker for 40+ years.

BSNL has found itself unable to retain talented engineers who get trained at the government's expense for 5 years, only to have Airtel poach them or see them get bent and start to profit off contracts.

As others have said all PSUs and Banks depend on BSNL - it is not going anywhere, so calm down. Motabhai to the rescue ü§ë They were making operating profit in 2014 and 15, with the entry of Jio it started making loss. Is it a coincidence? Govt. wants to sell BSNL assets to Jio, it does not want BSNL to continue, it's all because of the government. so this was a jumla ? 

https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/after-9-years-bsnl-to-make-first-net-profit-by-2018-rs-prasad/story-ZFwM9OHn5ZuSFLOpW3a3gK.html In my opinion, the article is not being fair in blaming all of BSNL's problems on government policies and infrastructure. BSNL has been losing customers, many of them due to poor customer service. I know some older people who desperately wanted to hang on to their BSNL connections, but finally gave up in frustration because of the attitude of the employees. I have had occasion to go to BSNL offices, and they treat you very poorly. I believe, if the frontline employees had be more customer friendly, they would have retained many more customers and wouldn't have been in this place in the first place. They had the advantage of having the customer base, and it was theirs to lose - which they did. They should have been the number 1 broadband and telephone company in India but they ruined everything. Their internet plans were shite when I was growing up compared to Airtel , their customer support is a pisstake and frequent disconnections. RIP BSNL SIM users, who ported to BSNL when Airtel and Voda removed lifetime validity.

Hotstar - The Office. First impressions.,171,c6exdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c6exdn/hotstar_the_office_first_impressions/,179,1561720203.0,"I get it. Everyone LOVES Steve Carell as Michael Scott, and The Office (US) will forever remain a treasure. When the promos for The Office (India) came out, I decided to remain positive among all the haters. The fact remains that even The US Office did terrible in its first season, trying to emulate the UK original. It's only after the 2nd season, where they tweaked it to their humor that it grew into one of the best shows ever.

So coming to the Indian one. I patiently waited until midnight for the show to drop and fired it up immediately. Here are some impressions. For people who have never seen The Office (US) these will be SPOILERS. For the fans of the show, these will be inside jokes. (I'd love to be a part of one someday)

&#x200B;

1. They used a new title track and quite frankly, it is meh. Maybe a Scranton 7.
2. Indian Pam is cute af. Great casting. Also, her name is .... wait for it.. Pammi! (Identity theft is not a joke!)
3. Desi Toby is annoying af. Because he overacts to the moon. OG Toby was annoying because he hardly emoted. This guy toh bhai. NO GOD NO!
4. Jagdeep Chadda aka Desi Michael Scott does a really good job! He's not tried to be Michael Scott and this works for him.
5. Oscar is a great cast as well! I'm only like 90% sure of this though, but I believe Oscar in the Indian version is a guy named Chinchin, who looks like he's from the North East but is actually from Karkardooma, East Delhi (there's a pretty funny scene in the second episode, **Diversity Day**). Again, I'm not entirely sure this is Oscar (he isn't wearing fabulous, bright-colored clothes you know) but it does fit the bill!
6. Remember how they changed the title track? Well, everything else is pretty much a straight-up carbon copy from the US show. The office layout, desi Phyllis who is always knitting. I wonder if Bob Vance is gonna be Bunty BlueStar, BlueStar refrigeration.
7. The episodes are 95% scene to scene remakes with the jokes tweaked for Indian audience. (Jello isn't a thing here, so Dwight's stapler is in something else) Having watched the US show easily over 10 times, I knew each scene before it took place.
8. \*\*Two of the shows longest standing and most memorable jokes, Asst to the regional Manager, and Thats What She Said (TWSS).\*\*I was very eager to see how they'd play Asst to the regional manager. I was very disappointed. It took me 2 takes to actually understand the indian version. i won't be surprised if you miss it the first time. TWSS hasn't turned up yet (only 2 epis down.) but big things usually take time. That's what she said.
9. This is my most favorite topic. Many have discussed how, if The Office (US) aired exactly today, it would face endless backlash for the blatant stereotyping, the misogyny, the racism (all by Michael Scott), and would never get more than 2 seasons in todays political climate. The Indian one is taking a huge gamble by repeating the same tropes. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely stand by it in the form of art. But I won't be surprised to see pitchforks and a Twitter Army assembling.

The first episode is free to watch and available at : [https://www.hotstar.com/tv/the-office/s-2187/welcome-to-wilkins-chawla/1260007027](https://www.hotstar.com/tv/the-office/s-2187/welcome-to-wilkins-chawla/1260007027)  (thanks, u/ppatra)",darmyster,Non-Political," I don't think the show ever makes excuses for Michael Scott's racism or sexism or overall unwokeness. There are plenty of such characters in today's television as well. 

Whenever Michael Scott does something racist to Darrell, it's not Darrell or his race, which is the joke. It's Michael Scott. I watched first 15 minutes while rushing for Office (hehe) and I liked it. I have also seen the US version multiple times and knew the scenes beforehand. I feel they have done a good job so far. Casting is decent. Also some jokes are tweaked for Indian audience. It clearly shows they are respecting the source material and not murdering it. Can't wait to watch it completely.

&#x200B;

Also Amit (Jim's counterpart) is having similar huge nose like Jim lol. Were they specifically looking for someone who has similar nose? Its almost like they used makeup or prosthetics to make his nose look big. ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.""

-- Wayne Gretzky 

----- Michael Scott. Just finished watching the first episode. Storyline is same as the US one so I knew exactly what's gonna happen. (That kinda ruined the watching experience) 

It's funny and casts are good, the acting doesn't seem to be cringe-worthy as it was looking in the trailer. If anyone hasn't watched the US version then it's gonna be fun. 

I wish they move the storyline to something original like what happened with the US one. Even if that doesn't happen I'm gonna wait eagerly for the wedding scene. üòÑ What do you mean OG show? Gervais/Merchant version is the OG. Should i watch if i haven't watched the American one? The first season of the office (US) is really awkward when you watch it for the first time. However it is amazing when you have the whole series and rewatch it again. I hope people give a bit of leeway to shows like these if we really want our television standards to improve. I want to see who they cast for Creed. 2nd episode was good. 3rd one ""You are anti-national!!"" that was funny. Glad to see writers are pretty woke about subjects. Good job OP. I was waiting for someone to do a quick review. Thanks!
Do they have the hahaha background whenever there is a funny moment? That would ruin it for me completely. That's what she said = Baby bhi yei Boli", plowman_digearth ambar_hitman ppatra ppatra Holypatchouli Kshatriya71 sleazebang subtopewds609 RaftelIsMyCity PadhiyeTohSahi igivequalityhugs

I am 45 years old and in my lifetime no Dalit ever took a haircut in our shops. They used to visit the shop in Bhojpur.""

I don't get it. Why would they not welcome new customers? What does caste have to do with it? And why would it matter to Muslims, if at all? Had heard about christains using separate burialgrounds/churches for higher n lower castes but never heard abot it in islam. TIL.

Inside the Dating Life of a Mediocre/Average Looking Guys,335,bz8uvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bz8uvn/inside_the_dating_life_of_a_mediocreaverage/,372,1560262359.0,"##No Long Posts From Now On

##Thanks for the Platinum Reddit stranger

**Intro** - *Please read the edits too.*

**Prologue** - *The following post is written in no way to justify the actions of crass men who exist in our society and unfortunately it's quite shameful for even us that such men exist who harrass women and make their lives hell. Even I am not perfect and have my own flaws. I have written it at start and not at the end edit part so that people atleast read this and not call me misogynist, sexist pig who has written this for petty karma or gilding without reading. Or even call me someone who would brag about his masculinity and inflated ego.*

Now coming to the main part as to how-if not most-many women treat mediocre/average guys when they approach the ladies after practising what to say and shitting their pants. This hit me yesterday when someone said why are you taking it personally, well if someone tells their side of the story maybe it's time for me to also tell the least discussed opposite side of the coin.

Before I start let me tell you a small life story of my first proposal that till today taught me a lot. A month or two before exams a few of neighborhood friends and me decided to take private group tuitions. This is where I met my crush. So after boards, JEE mains and advanced and BITSAT all had ended we used to hang out a bit often. One day while we came back from lunch because her birthday's party was due, I told her that I had developed something for her that I couldn't explain. She said she got to know by my actions and a very caring attitude and treatment. So I still remember we were D block parking, CP where she told me these lines that I try to quote nearly what I remember. ""I have no feelings for you and I have to say NO to you. It might hurt you today but you'll remember me for good."" 
That moment was the most heartbreaking moment for me, I won't lie I didn't say a word, left her alone there, took a metro and came back home. On the way back I deleted her number, deleted the message chat on my Nokia. I accepted her decision, though I cried but did accept. After about 10-12 days we meet, I have no feelings for her anymore like 85% were dead, 15% remained because she was my crush. She hugged me and said sorry for she was rude(which she wasn't) and I too said sorry for leaving her alone and coming back home and deleting her number and everything immature I did. 

So to this day we are great friends and she has been an amazing advisor to me. How did that happen? It's because she didn't keep me on strings and told me one word i.e. **NO**. She didn't make pathetic excuses, kept me on hold or played with my emotions. What if she had played with me? I couldn't answer that but eventually found out as I grew up.

Jumping back to the present stage. A few weeks backs I announced at the LNRDT that I am going on my first date after a long time. I was really excited. I trimmed my hair, shaved my beard, chose perfect shirt and jeans and took out my new sneakers. Told mom I was going on my X friend's birthday in a cafe in CP. Though she might have guessed it's entirely a different story. I get a WhatsApp maybe hour or so before leaving that due to hot weather she can't make it as her parents aren't allowing. I thought it might be genuine concern and then said let's catch-up someday evening. I was pretty much sad but somehow consoled myself that it's just being shifted and not being cancelled. That's when things started to get shady. She gradually stopped reply to my texts and when I finally asked her about 10 days later why is she playing with me and ghosting me she told me ""She was sorry to play around me, but she had found someone else who was more compatible and *taller* than me."" I said ok bye. I hung up, deleted her chats and number and remembered the my first rejection.

Here comes the main part how we (addressing mediocre and average looking men) are treated by women who are significantly out of our aukat. 

* When you try to hit on them or even ask them out instead of telling **NO** they play along. They emotionally drain us and make us feel that even though we are shit as compared to them, still if we improve ourselves we can become capable of dating them. In the meanwhile they use our goodness and services and we act as their butlers, keeping track of their lives, sharing their happiness and being with them in their times of hardship. 
* Then when they feel we have improved ourselves and get ready to propose again with much confidence and improvements, they drop the emotional blackmail bomb. They simply address it by saying that ""What if we break up, what if we aren't compatible, what if we fight"", and so many guilt trip giving queries. Then drops the nuclear missile, ""See I don't want to lose a caring human being like you, in these few days we have become more like best friends but not a couple.""
* The guys pretty much get into the guilty feeling of losing such an amazing human being in life and settle for sticking around as a friend killing all the feelings after being put on strings and never told a straight forward NO.
* Poor guys like us don't even get a clue that it was never going to happen. It was just a way of slowly controlling us like a puppet to have their way.
* Even if the above scenario doesn't take place, it's alternative takes place. Where comes in the close friends WhatsApp groups that has screenshots of the guys pictures, all chats and girls mocking how that guy doesn't her standards and too average to be presentable. Instead of again telling a **NO** game is played, excuses are built up and a whole circle of the same activity takes place, where eventually the guy suffers as he is emotionally drained, stuck in between like a dhobi ka kutta (washerman's dog). Can't even get away from her because friendship and can't even come closer because standards don't match and he is kept for entertainment purposes.
* Or if you are a bit above average like my friend and you get a proposal and you turn it down straightway saying you aren't interested, the girl says she is going to take her life and then your life again gets in hell. Or you fall into the trap of dating someone who just broke up and dates you to be her emotional punching bag.

What's one thing common here? Selective biasness or as someone pointed out the Halo Effect. 

> The halo effect is a cognitive bias that causes¬†one trait (e.g., beauty) to drastically color your perception of all other traits. If you think someone is beautiful, you are also likely to assume they‚Äôre smart, ambitious, interesting, etc.

Simply saying it means that if a guy is good looking he is smart, trustworthy and compatible. But if a guy is average/mediocre he doesn't match your standards, would turn out to be creepy and even clingy.

That's why ladies readily accept a good looking guy, but keeps the average looking guy on hold/strings. Where she is the captain of his emotions. She will decide whether his feelings should stay or get killed. She won't ever say straightway **NO** but play and give excuses, stall, keep the person on strings. Till he is emotionally drained, mentally exhausted and aggression grips him. 

But see our plight you know, even though both good looking and mediocre looking people belong to the gender shared by rapists, harrassers, assaulter etc, who gets instantly blacklisted quite a few times? The mediocre looking guy and good looking guy gets a free pass . And it's not just my story, it the story of countless people who are termed as lifeless virgins nowadays. 

I know women go through the major hardships but when they are asked why didn't they say **NO**, they say because they don't want to be at the receiving end of the outcome. Well no denying they have to deal with psychos, but also they get out of that situation easily by always making the same excuse. For that no one would blame them thanks to such crass people who share the same gender with us. Who ends up at the real receiving end? Ofcourse the average looking guys. Because we don't have anything of our own after we propose or luckily get into a relationship with a woman up a higher notch. She is the holder of our emotions, she can blackmail us easily because we aren't her level and she has done a massive favour for us. She controls us emotionally and mentally. And in that process we get torn into bits and pieces. **The excuses and keeping us on strings where straightway a harsh and hurting truth in form of NO, could have been told, we get more agressive and much more fanatic. Getting in a relationship becomes an obsession because we are drained of emotions and love and affection is all we need.**

Thinking of all my dates and talking to my friends yesterday one things is clear, how to get a bit of love and affection, we give up a huge part of our emotional self. Where instead of giving ourselves and our families and friends importance we get trapped and give someone the importance and limelight who is just there to play around and fiddle with us. For women they can easily say they don't trust men but what can we say? Nothing? We are just played along the way and blamed eventually for all things that we do and even might not have done ever.

**And weird part is nearly everyone I talked to from a few friends to Reddit strangers** have gone through same shit, but it never comes to light because we are the tough gender. Handling rejections shouldn't be a huge task for us. How to tell handling rejections would have been easier if it was a simple NO and not a game of snakes and ladders. It's somewhere our fault too that we fail to take note of all that glitters is not gold kind of situation. That we fail to move on rather than going down the spiral. Is a straight NO too much to ask for? Are we such low class begins that telling us **NO** on face has such negative impact?

I don't know how people will respond to me, maybe I get downvoted, maybe I get abused, maybe I get called out for shifting the blame or anything. But one thing for sure is I feel somewhat sad and happy at the same time while writing this down. Sad because I couldn't take control of the situations even though my intuition said so and happy because I could tell the least discussed side of my lives.

**What's the way out? Simple, rather than being someone's dog on leash, live your life alone with friends and family and do arranged marriage at the end. Because you don't have those attractive genes and inner beauty matters shit when you only seen to be a friendship material.**

PS - While saving this it made me realise how quite a lot of us get ill treated and never have the courage to speak out but at the same time I realised, **HOW WE ILL TREAT WOMEN AT TIMES TOO IN THE NAME OF FORCED LOVE AND AFFECTION. AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE IF I HAVE EVEN FOR A MOMENT ILL TREATED SOMEONE.**

##Thanks to my crush for making me stronger and more emotionally sound as a human being to handle rejections better and part ways with someone who isn't available to share her feelings

Edit 1: Don't abuse anyone, I have written this post from all your experiences, so be a bit more sensible and even if girls comment something let them comment and read their views as well. We have to be a bit courteous fellas.

**Edit 2: People saying you get played because of kindness and all. I have seen enough shit so I don't fall for it now because of my experience and people around me who advice me.

BOYS DO SUFFER EMOTIONALLY.**",ssj_cule,Non-Political," I see all these beta losers telling their crushes that they like them and then getting rejected.

An alpha chad like me just bottles these feelings inside, checks their crushes' Instagram every night before sleeping, and just stares at their crushes from a distance (stealthily). This was an interesting read. Must have taken you a long time to type it out. Your first crush seems like a pretty cool person. Mujhe teri pappi leni hai Man I allot more time to read Reddit posts than I can possibly allot for a date. Maybe it's because I just don't give a damn about girls now, all those teenage years trying to get a gf or just a date is so behind me. India usually has a demand and supply issue. Lots and lots of guys are there for almost every girl even if she is very average. Even from the doodhwala, to auto wala, to neighbor wala, to classmates, to colleagues, to general stalkers try to hit on her or propose her for dating. They have a lot to chose from and are brought up thinking they are the centre of attraction. This somehow gets them high.

Also to blame are the shitty cheesy movies and music videos where the girl plays hard to get.

This is just my observation of my friends love life. I'm glad I didn't have to go through a lot, at least whenever I initiated a relationship. Though things get fucked up later, but that is purely about mine or my partners fault. Reading this made me feel pretty good about my life right now. [deleted] Out of our Aukaat üòÇ .

[NP] [Rant] Indian men are the biggest crabs in the bucket and we need to change that.,161,cagvi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cagvi4/np_rant_indian_men_are_the_biggest_crabs_in_the/,84,1562591667.0,"This is in response to a thread I read in here which stated some Italian woman who was concerned with her Indian interest. Comments like 'Beware he'll run away' or 'Indians are either too nice or too disrespectful' always come in when these kind of threads are there. 



Everytime you see an Indian dude who is usually much above the typical 'Hilaake soja' mentality of most guys out there, people shame him to no limit and then bring them to their level. Why can't you be happy for someone else's success? Even when someone's asking for some decent advice, are we that critical of ourselves that we label that person as bad/indecent for asking advice for a basic human need?


Every single time a friend of mine gets someone pretty to date this is the general mentality. 'Isko kaise mil gayi itni achi (How did he find someone so good looking', 'Langoor ke haath me angoor''Bodyguard/Friendzoned hai/Bas ghuma rahi hai' are the typical comments. 
Is it really that hard for you to believe that someone might not be as miserable as you when it comes to the opposite sex?


Other than a handful of folks who are sincere, you get nasty comments from everyone around you if you try to work on your health/looks. It's like being Indian is a curse and that label just means you have to be an ugly looking bloke with a pot belly on your body since that's the way it 'should be'.

No one tries to learn from the other person, no one tries to instill the values that the person might have, they always reach the simple conclusion that if I, who is playing video games and has a dull IT job, I can't get a decent woman then no one else can in my circle. That mindset will get you so far lmfao.


Are we this self hating that we can't believe for a second that an Indian dude is not having it that bad with women or life in general? And we just have to instill the stereotypes that most of the decent dudes out there are trying to fight?





Please support and uplift our brethren, we need it much more than others. A humble request, that's all.",for_acedemia,Non-Political," Many people in India have really low self esteem regarding their own ethnicity . I don‚Äôt mean to offend but that‚Äôs what I have observed . This is not only about women/dating.

When people get good jobs in IT or a promotion, people react with- ""he must be good at networking, he doesn't have any skill"", ""those pegs with the boss really worked"" etc.

When a student tops the class by serious study, backbenchers be like- ""she is a teachers pet, that's why she tops"", or, ""he is such a muggu, he always rote memorizes, doesn't understand shit"", or, ""she has 2 teachers for each subject"", why won't she top?""

Whenever anyone gets a job in the military, other candidates go like- ""how much bribe did it cost you?""

Fuck those normies.

Everyone should be in their shape of mentality. Anyone not fitting their mentality is somehow bad. Normies will be outright hostile towards people who are different. If you are reading a book instead of playing PUBG, you are a _show off_ to them.

The best way is to ignore. They don't feed you or buy you clothes. Just ignore them.

Keep working hard, keep your focus, achieve your goals.

Don't pay attention to those crabs. There are a lot of can confirm am indian type users in here. And they bitch about Facebook users. I've also noticed that many Indian guys considered good looking or handsome outside India or to non Indians are considered ugly by Indians simoky cos their are darker or whatever. > that if I, who is playing video games and has a dull IT job, 

I got to stop you right there. What is wrong with people who game. or for that matter with people who are in a dull IT job. Arent you also just stereotyping too. something you talked against 2 lines down.  

For all the good you are trying to say in that post, everything you said is a 0 for me with the way you put it. Yep. Indian men instead of being wing man, play the opposite role of bringing your moral and game down. Your original point about it being a crappy thing for Indian men putting other Indian men down is valid, but that isn't always the case. There are people who are genuinely helpful to others. Also, I think you confused two different things - one seemed to be about how Indian men talk to other Indian men, and the other seemed to be about how Indian men talk about other Indian men.

Not being able to feel happiness for the success of others isn't only an Indian trait, but we probably do it more than others, and if we do, it maybe because we have to fight so many more people off to succeed, given our large numbers. It is still very petty, obviously. And the best way to deal with that would be to ignore the naysayers, and focus on whatever you are doing that is getting them all worked up. Get your body ripped if you like, and get all the ladies you can get, if that's what you want from life.

But the reputation of Indian men outside India is generally really terrible. I don't need to recount experiences from personal life, both from my travels outside the country and from interaction with foreigners traveling to India, to make that point. You should read some of the threads on Reddit, and you will see what I mean. And there is no way I will ever defend the pathetic behaviour so many of our ""brethren"" seem to indulge in routinely. It is annoying to be asked questions like ""but why do they want to take a photo with me when they don't even know me?"" or ""is it common for men to ask random women if they can hug them?"", especially when these are only the milder sort of creepy things we have become known for. And this isn't self-loathing, this is fact. Since i left India i am quite happy  in every area of life. I hated indian guys always talking girls, thinking girls and dream of girls. They stare at girls like they are a product.  If you got girlfriend ‚Äúyaar meri bhi koi setting karwadey‚Äù if you have money they hate, if you have good job hate, what‚Äôs happening in your house relatives are more interested in it then you. Any incident is like masala talks for people. Judging a person is a lifestyle. Religion, caste, show off of anything or everything materialistic. I can go on and on. I hope situation changing. I hadn't encountered people like this till the first year of my college. I had a girlfriend at that time who was supposedly 'Out of my league' and well you can guess what most guys in my engineering class thought/said about that. I was taken aback when I realised what they are saying isn't just limited to friendly banter, they genuinely mean every word of it. The people with this kind of mentality are the ones who are too afraid to even talk to someone they perceive as out of their league and then they act all bitter when someone else dates her. And I totally get what you mean by dragging to their level, faced some of that shit myself back then.

Living a double life is stressful and on most occasions leads to depression and suicidal tendencies. I can hope for a day when Government, Judiciary and Bureaucracy take note of our plight. We need TV and newspaper ads, and LGBT education in schools and colleges. Decriminalisation of homosexual acitvies was just one step to a long road of LGBTQ+ acceptance in the society.

[RANT] The quality of life in Indian metros is astoundingly awful,296,c2dzrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c2dzrj/rant_the_quality_of_life_in_indian_metros_is/,230,1560957788.0,"By Indian metros, I generally mean Mumbai, Delhi/Gurgaon, and Bangalore. I can't say about Kolkata or Chennai or Hyderabad because I've never lived there.

It amazes me that so many people are okay living in such awful living conditions. There is no concept of work-life balance, traffic is atrocious, there are few public spaces, and even things like clean water and air are hard to get.

Even large corporations are now asking their employees to do ""startup hours"" and work 10-12 hours a day. The commute takes 2 hours for most of my friends. They have no concept of a personal life and no energy to pursue any hobbies or interests. Its just go to work, come home, sleep, and then unwind on the weekend. 

Traffic and the lack of roads has gone from bad to worse. Delhi is still saved because of metro, but its shameful that cities as large as Bangalore and Mumbai have so little metro presence in nearly 2020.

Add to that the lack of public spaces where people can just meet together. Yes, there are lots of parks in these cities, but most of the time, they're so far from places of work that they're seldom used by regular office going people. Delhi's parks are in South & Central Delhi, while most people work in Gurgaon. As a result, ""public spaces"" are now basically awful corporate shopping centres (like Cyberhub). In Mumbai, you have Marine Drive, but that's not where most people work.

Throw in crappy air quality (Delhi is the worst culprit), shitty water quality (Bangalore water has made all my friends bald before their time), and often, no water at all.

And top it all, rent is uncontrollably high in most of these places. Houses that wouldn't pass muster even in third world shitholes are passed off ""luxurious"" in these cities. Landlords make up their own rules (like asking for a year's rent as deposit - wtf?). And forget buying a place of your own near your workplace - anything affordable is fucking 40km from the office.

Why the hell are people living in these places not demanding more? They're the economic centres of the country, contributing literally hundreds of billions of $ to the GDP. Yet they're shat on by governments, treated like third-class citizens, and given zero attention by everyone.",mrfreeze2000,Non-Political," Well, as a corporate stooge in one of these metros, I do want to demand better conditions. But I also know it's easier for my employer to find 10 other people to do my job and I'll just be left in the dust. Bangalore has no space and still the average building is two stories tall. Our metro cities need to be renovated with world class infrastructure and high quality and affordable public transports. A lot of investment is required to bring these cities to the level of Jakarta, Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur (forget Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapur, Dubai or Guangzhou).

- High speed, affordable and ample public transport connecting the suburban towns with the city centre will solve a lot of problems.

- More highrises will reduce the housing costs.

- Encouragement to REIT type funds will increase the availability of professionally managed and affordable rent units.

- Reduction of private cars on road on prime time to reduce congestion. I moved to Bengaluru from Delhi last year after getting my job, and the small increase in quality of life didn't last long. I despise Bengaluru now. 

Living here is becoming increasingly hellish, as the days pass by. Looks like emigrating is the only sensible option left now. > Why the hell are people living in these places not demanding more? 

Because the companies cannot afford to be giving out more money. The consumer in India cannot afford a product or a service at the same rate at which it is sold outside India. To keep margins lower, this is where the buck stops and this is where the cost cutting is done. And if youre working a job where you're getting 20k, and you'd be getting 40k outside India, and you'd think you're worthy of atleast 30k, there are going to be a 100 people in line willing to work for 15k.

If you talk about housing, if there's a shitty flat at 15k/month, the landlords increase the amenities, add some nice furniture and increase the cost to 20k/month, the tenants would move to a dilapidated place where they could save that 5k/month. If the landlord changed the building's outlook from ""budget flats"" to ""nice flats for richer people"", they would then compete with other corporations and agencies who do a better job and keep their own costs low by having government agencies in their back pocket and save their costs by evading taxes. 

All of these scenarios exist due to a carefully laid structure of economic struggle in the Indian middle class fuelled solely and solely by overpopulation Apart from the usual suspect in these issues (overpopulation), the government is really, and I mean REALLY, to blame here. A breakdown:

1. As our population kept on increasing no thought was ever given to how urban planning would have to be modified to combat such a problem. Hell, people don't even fucking study ""urban planning"" in India; it's apparently not very mainstream despite almost half a billion people suffering from the ill-effects of its absence. In most major cities there are dedicated departments for planning of cities and these include top talent from around the country, who, in tandem with the researchers of the country, work towards finding better solutions for the problems plaguing their metros.
2. Corruption is our second biggest enemy: the builder-politician nexus is too strong and if left unchecked, as in Mumbai for example, results in haphazard development that strains the resources of the city. I remember as a child I used to watch my Dad go to these city planning meetings in our home town in Long Island (NY) - all residents of a given colony were invited to a discussion and asked for approval each time a builder wanted to erect a structure in their colony. No way for corruption to seep in, all residents felt like equal stakeholders. And they really should be, because while land does belong to governments or private entities, air and water belong to everyone. An attack on these resources constitutes an attack on our living conditions.
3. Finally, because of the general fear of the government and how it can silence you, most people really don't bother protesting or writing to their local leaders. Water ran out? Too bad, try to buy a tanker. Children dying from a totally preventable condition in a government hospital? Too bad, try procreating some more. The government being apathetic is really no surprise, but it's the people that can't afford to be apathetic.

And one last thing - fuck BuzzFeed and other publications that glamorize this version of our metros and cash in on that nostalgia. Our metros are fucking disgusting compared to others in the world, and while there are good reasons for this they don't change the fact that no sane person would choose to live in Mumbai if they are already living in fucking NYC. I see my cousins and friends who live in Mumbai share this crap on a weekly basis (""Mumbai is the greatest city in the world because it has amazing fast food, OMG!"") and it gets really infuriating. > I can't say about Kolkata or Chennai or Hyderabad 

About the same things. They are all equally shitty, some more severe than others. Well due to huge population. Every one is expendable if you don't want to work in the shit hole, there will be 100 more lining up to replace you. 

Due to this the governing authorities or the companies don't give a shit about the various problems in the city. As they know that no matter what business is going to run as usual and smooth.

Moreover they also have the audacity to slap some fancy tag line for such shitty life for e.g. spirit of mumbai. I completely agree. I just couldn't see myself living my life like that (in Bangalore) and thought about it seriously and moved out. It meant starting everything all over again but the peace is well worth it. 
There is no concept of Work Life Balance. Everyone is just adamant in sucking the life out of each other. No hobbies out of work. There is no time to do pretty much anything.
I wonder how long this keeps going. The average employee needs to come together and demand more out of everyone, the office, the authorities and in turn modify his life accordingly. Be good to each other. Specially when you are in a position of authority. One word: Overpopulation Well, I'm living in Chennai for the past two months and honestly , I don't feel like going back to Delhi anytime soon. My flat is around 15-20 mins away from work by cabs and 30 mins by bus which includes a 10 min walk. Pollution is less as compared to Delhi. My company has chill work hours. I was allowed to set my own time and minimum work hours is 8 per day with weekends being off ( this happened recently). Honestly, minus the climate , Chennai has been good to me. I've travelled by buses and it's just a 15-20 minutes of disease. Also, it's very cheap. Lots of greenery. There's a reservoir near my house , which sadly has dried up due to the water scarcity but I've been told that during monsoon when it's full a lot of rare birds come and take rest there. Also, it's pleasant in the evening due to it being near to the sea. It's not like that in Delhi. You won't feel that hot in the evening in Chennai. So, your point of view depends heavily on the company and place you live. Lucky for me, I have a healthy work - life balance. *Rent is very cheap I'm Chennai.

"Y'all ""Machine Learning / AI enthusiasts"" got to chill out.",449,c0w10u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c0w10u/yall_machine_learning_ai_enthusiasts_got_to_chill/,223,1560624326.0,"This post only addresses to people who are in college. I don't mean to discourage you but there are things other than AI/ML that you have to learn. Do not have great pride if you used Tensorflow to ""make a machine learning model"" and don't call yourself an ML engineer. If you don't know the math, don't know how shit works, then shut up. Learn and then call yourself a ML scientist or ML Engineer. EVERYBODY knows how much of an ""ML Engineer"" you are in second year of engineering.

It is pissing off looking at how great these people think they are because they could build something that classifies a cat and a dog or some similar thing from a Udemy / Udacity course. Below is my fuckall rant about these fuckall people. If you care to read.

So, my company got on some bandwagon to include student developers and shortlisted people only on resume. Neither did I ask nor did I want any interns, but I was given interns. Now, I have no clue how skilled these people are and what they know. I work odd hours and am usually busy, but I wanted to give these people a platform.  Obviously I can't expect or give them production code to debug or fix, so I had to basically create tasks for them. I didn't have the chance to even speak to one of them before hiring, but I was told that they were told the role would involve Java and JUnit Testing. 

The first day, I wanted to just know how much they know and asked them basic OOPs questions and even without attempting to answer the questions, 8/10 people ask me why they're being asked Java stuff and why can't they be given ML stuff because they've experience. There is scope for ML in my team, but I can't trust students with the kind of data we work with and there are actual ML engineers who've been working in this field working on problems. 

I didn't know what they expected, so I told them to get started with writing JUnit test cases for some of our prototypes or they could start working on some internal prototype application in any framework of their choice. Either way, it was either testing or app / web development. No fancy ML stuff. I assigned them a mentor to approach for any doubts they have.

Before the end of the day, I had 4 emails requesting for a 1-on-1 meeting. I talk to them and its the same shit again. They want to do ML work and they're practically demanding I assign them ML work because they know there is ML work. I tell them that the data we work with can not be shared that easily and that they were not interviewed for this. But still, they're telling me how every company outside is offering ML work and we are giving the ""dirty"" work to interns. I tell them I'll see what can be done and told them I'll get back by Monday. The feedback from their mentor is that they don't know how to code anything in Java. Anything, at all. He gave them basic debugging tasks and they have no clue how to use a debugger. They don't know any of the design patterns. They know nothing but they want to do ML stuff, even when they were clearly told that they'd be working with Java or JUnit. I even made an exception to give them other projects because they didn't do java in college in depth and offered to provide them Java training (which is very relevant and paid for by the company with certification), but they still want to do ML.

Until here, is fine. I have dealt with a lot of people like this because I keep talking to university students. Where I totally lost it was, today I get a call from the father of one of the interns. He is in the senior management in some other company and he is asking me what is wrong in giving his talented son ML jobs. He then proceeds to tell me how the generation has changed, nobody uses Java and ML is the future and all. At this point, everything is looking like a meme come true. But this guy is serious. This guy thinks, if you can copy paste code and get something running, you can do ML stuff everywhere.

Seriously, if you are a university student and one of these ""ML/DL/AI/Blockchain/NN/XYZ Enthusiasts"", either find an internship that is specific to that area or don't be so rigid. The world is much more bigger than your small bubble and nobody owes you anything. Its not like there are surplus jobs that you can demand these things at such a junior level and learn to be humble. That thing pays off more than any of your worthless Youtube certifications. 

Sorry for the harsh language, but this intern has managed to successfully ruin my weekend after that stupid 30 minute lecture from his dad and I am just too pissed.",FanneyKhan,Non-Political," Wait, they didn't do any Java in school? Isn't Java a super important language? Also, you stayed on the phone for 30 minutes with the dad lol. Bhaiya mujhe bhi job do na

I am well versed with ADS using Cpp

God promise Just give them some data labelling/cleaning/fixing work. Every hand counts. They'll thank you for putting them through this special hell as well. What exactly do you do at your company? Why does an intern's father have access to your number? Why are you required to answer him, that too for 30 min.? I wish more people could read this. Actually dude my 3rd year will start this year, i am mostly into java programming not so good , so i wanted to know how can i improve my java, through videos or other knowledgeable stuff and about OOP, i wanted to go further than that to be frank how much will it be helpful even if i don't decide to get into ML/AI. I think the main problem here is an internship interview loop on which you were not included. Had you got the chance to talk to them before, things would be better no? I don't even have a clue as to what I want to do in life lol. I started back on Python. I have no clue whatsoever. I totally agree with you.Nobody's a ML expert,except a few who've worked their ass off.Moreover,ML and AI isn't a new concept,it has been there for quite some time,it's just that people are talking a lot about it these days so everyone is interested in it,or should I say,wants to be a part if.

Moreover,engineering colleges don't teach shit about it.I myself am an engineering student and to my bad luck,am studying under (probably) the most corrupt university in the history of mankind-VTU.

They've recently introduced AI and ML in their syllabus,but the truth is,it's purely theoretical and surface level knowledge,you can't really claim to know AI,because all they teach is the basics(of the basics).

FYI,not only students,even lecturers are involved in this shit,my own college lecturers are being treated as ""AI/ML experts"" even though their knowledge in it is as much as the students(or maybe even less) .

Thank you for posting this though,it's quite informative. As someone from a Tier-1 college who has  just started learning some basic ml, I totally agree. People just import sklearn and just dump the data and then calculate accuracy is all they do. How a model processes and learns data is not at all important for  most people just saying I am doing ML sounds cool. The math behind ml is far too complicated for me and I don't think I'll do more courses. Every startup talks they're doing ML and all they do is shit, that I've seen during my intenr Since you/your company never needed interns and you are anyway making up inessential tasks just to keep them busy, may be just invent tasks that involve coding up ML algorithms from scratch using Java or coding up a java wrapper for their favourite framework or do ML using java frameworks on some synthetic data for the kids to play with. It's a win-win for everybody.

Sounds to me like you are turning a pretty routine situation into one where you are losing your peace of mind enough to come rant here, where neither those students nor your company is gaining anything at all, and will most likely convert a bunch of eager youngsters and potential future employees into a cynical bunch who'll shun your company and ask their friends to shun your company forever.

So my dad worked for an MNC and he was let go with 20 lakhs as severance pay. Now from my research, severence pay is not taxable, however the company filed TDS on the severence pay in Form 16. 

Query: 1. How do I get the money back, especially when the Company is refusing to amend the Form 16? 

Cheers and Thanks. &#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok So I am in some complex things.

&#x200B;

1. I work for a US company which pays in dollars. I get the amount in Rupees automatically from Paypal.

&#x200B;

2. I get a job in November and getting a regular salary. TDS is filed on that

&#x200B;

3. I pay some money to friends and they invest it and return me with profit. I do all the transaction online. No cash involved here.

How to calculate tax liability on that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now 2 years back, I had a CA from cleartax and he made my tax filings by taking 50% as the salary from the 1st business.

Can I still do that?

&#x200B;

So I am asking how should I calculate my earning

&#x200B;

50% of gross receipts from 1st + salary from 2nd + 50% of receipts from 3rd = Total taxable salary

&#x200B;

and 30% IncomeTax on that.

&#x200B;

Is that correct ? Hi, I've never filed a tax return in my life! Can you please guide me to a link which has some useful pointers? Thanks Let's say i sell a PDF book online and accept money via paypal, how should I show it in tax returns? I read that there is no GST under 10lakh income. i am going to save this post and ask you in couple of days once i start filing. I got these (automated?) letters saying you paid X advanced tax(for ltcg) the year before please explain why you haven't paid this year. If I have no advanced tax liability this year whats the right way to deal with these letters? I emailed them twice but I keep getting the letters. What is the point of Tax rebates? Complete noob here. Last year I worked for a PSU for 5 months. So my income was below the minimum income limit for the whole year. But the tax was deducted at source while getting salary. How do I go about getting the return? [deleted] CA and a Lawyer?

If I had to bet, I'd say it was a drug overdose, but they probably waited to get rid of evidence to avoid the public scandal that would ensue if it came out that one of Bollywood's most beloved actresses was a dopehead. Supercop?? Is that Crime Petrol's music ? **Attention-seeker cop.**

[deleted] Obviously, no one is disagreeing that what he did was wrong but doesn't mean you don't care about a person dealing with depression. I hope Tanmay's friend are there with him to support and help him to get out of depression because that's what friends do.
I believe she has heard worse things from men told to her that made her life difficult but she must me more immune to ""words"" especially bcs she's a comedian. I'm sorry, but the problem with this female comedian, based on these tweets is more that she doesn't seem to enjoy rough banter. 

I 100% guarantee you, those guys say wayyy worse things to each other than what she's posted. 

It's the comedic, 'anything goes, we're just roasting each other to be funny' thing. And she didn't like it, and made it a feminist thing. ""Be careful, Aditi gets around"" can be twisted to be misogynistic. But if you follow podcasts of comedians (not just in India), the guys say much worse stuff to each other. Has anybody here seen an aditi mitral show? Did you guys find it funny? Why does Aditi Mittal get to shame/trivialize someone else's depression, but if someone else even cracks a joke about depression, people get up in arms. Is it because she's a female comedian? 

Also, another thing that gets me about this PC culture that we have going around right now is that almost always women, LGBTQ persons get to automatically claim the moral high ground. Just because other women/persons have been victims of society, why does every woman get to hold the moral high ground? 

Sorry for going off topic and for the rant, but I needed to say that. I'm not sure of Aditi's point here. She seems to be critical of the media, not Tanmay. Besides, Tanmay posted this on Instagram - what exactly is she even critical of the media for? 

> We've all been fucked over by life. But apparently depression is only newsworthy when someone who had a corporates throwing money at him stopped having money thrown at him.


https://twitter.com/awryaditi/status/1145288114434449410 Honestly the #MeToo had exposed people like Harvey Weinstein who misused their position in exchange for sex. 

This whole AIB matter is such a hype because all Tanmay did was ignore the complaints made to them. 
While I do not condone his actions, compared to Weinstein, Tanmay is a sperm waiting to meet an egg. 

This is why the person running an organization should familiarize themselves with the rules and regulations.

And if Aditi Mittal is complaining of someone slut shaming her, I wonder how normalized it is in the world to gossip about other people's lives. 

The problem is that a lot of things have become normalized, and the industry isn't changing a bit. These guys are new gen, I wonder what BWood actors have to say. Aditi mittal extremely irritating personality...in the roast itself when theyvsaid she sleeps around ..she says only with half of them..should have taken offence then Ye aunty h kon ? Right Wing bigots were so happy to see them go down. They are being punished more because they are not shameless like many others who were exposed during #MeToo.

"Lo·πáƒÅr Crater Lake (Maharashtra) - The only known crater in the world to have been created by a meteor entering at hypersonic velocity. Dated to be around 45,000 to 60,000 yrs ago, it is the 2nd largest crater in the Indian Subcontinent & a National Geo-Heritage Monument. (Source in comments)",1236,c2je70,https://i.redd.it/n2o21z4vdc531.png,91,1560991487.0,,Astro_Neel,Non-Political," Yeah Lonar Crater is really amazing. But your info is a bit wrong.

Lonar is one of a couple Hypervelocity Impact craters found in the world specifically on Basaltic rock. A year or Two Ago similar were found in Brazil. 

These impact craters are really cool cause the comet or rock should be going at at least something like 10 - 11 km/s, any meteorite hitting earth that speed forms a hypervelocity impact crater. Its not very rare for meteorites to get to that speed and a lot of craters fall into this category, but they still are really cool cause on impact they release much much more energy than if they were made of pure high explosive material, just because of their speed and because of this their craters are very distinct. But they are no where as close to being rare. 

Another important part of Lonar is the Basaltic rock. The black rock found in cave carvings all over Maharashtra like Ajanta and Ellora are primarily basalt. Now this a very common volcanic rock, usually formed when lava rich in magnesium and iron cool quickly when they get exposed near or at the surface of the earth. There's barely any silica in them (mafic rocks) , so the lava forming this rock is very ""calm and smooth"", not like the explosive volcanic eruptions that usually show up on TV, and the lava basically spreads like a liquid into nice smooth sheets as it cools down. Most of the western Deccan Peninsula has a basalt layer called the Deccan Traps. How they formed is questionable at best, but like most things in earth science no one is sure how most things formed. My favorite theory is that it formed when the tectonic plate carrying the Indian subcontinent passed over a volcanic hotspot when it separated from the Plate carrying the African Continent and before it hit the Eurasian continent. Hotspots themselves, have many theories for their formation and no one is fully sure about them, but they are basically ""leaks"" in the crust of the earth independent of the tectonic plates from these leaks magma form chains of volcanic land on the tectonic plate as it moves over the hotspot. Another Famous hotsopt is Hawaii in the pacific. The Deccan Traps could have been formed over a hotspot called Reunion Hotspot which is currently near Madagascar island. 

Now The reason why hypervelocity craters on basaltic rocks are really special is because of how these basaltic rocks form. Because they form such smooth solid layers that is decently hard for a rock, any impact made on them gets preserved very well. That is also a reason why Maharashtra cave carvings like Ajanta Ellora are so well preserved. Now This is why Lonar is so special. Because we were luck enough that that particular meteorite hit this Basaltic rock, the impact crater is really well preserved, even if it happened in the Pleistocene era which is ended about 15000 years ago. hypervelocity impacts happen often enough on earth but they are usually quickly eroded away and very few signs remain about their impact. Getting this impact on Basalt if frankly very lucky and that is why Lonar was very important region of study. 

This is also a reason why the newly discovered hypervelocity impact craters in Brazil is very exciting too because it basically gives us something we can use to compare the findings found at Lonar and better understand hypervelocity impacts. 

Edit: Earth science and structural geology is fun;  dumb mistakes fixed It's was a nice bike ride all the way to Lonar from Mumbai. The water in the lake has some pretty interesting characteristics. Anyone else wondering why the water is green? It's amazing to see Lonar on r/India. 
My dad grew up there and has been pestering us to visit Lonar since we were kids :) Been there.. Amazing  spot. The water is highly alkaline and slimy. Many of the people who flock there take a dip in it believing it has medicinal properties capable of curing skin diseases.

Sad to see very very few Indian people being aware of this wonder, let alone global. My sutta spot I've been there and its kind of middle of nowhere place. But calm and beautiful. Here's my snap

I am really surprised to know that it is Kalamsaab's signature. Congratulations buddy I usually sign books with the authors name before donating them. It's worth it if the second hand book seller gets some extra money because of it.

Lifecycle of Indian Male,48,ce06hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ce06hm/lifecycle_of_indian_male/,66,1563327030.0,"Day 1 ‚Äì You are born. Parents are celebrating that you are male and even more happier if you have fair skin.

&#x200B;

Childhood ‚Äì You are expected to go with the flow. You begin to learn the ins and outs of Indian society. Everything can be bargained for in the market and wild animals are everywhere. Creativity, loners, and independent thinking are frowned upon. If you get bullied, **IT‚ÄôS YOUR FAULT FOR BEING DIFFERENT**. Anything bad that happens (poor eyesight, too short, too fat, etc.) is also **YOUR FAULT**.

&#x200B;

More Childhood ‚Äì Your parents educate you on your background/culture and how it is the best in the world. In public, your family act friendly with everyone but in private they may make comments ranging from politically incorrect jokes to straight up racist statements. But it‚Äôs okay **BECAUSE YOU‚ÄôRE SPECIFIC CULTURE IS THE BEST**.

&#x200B;

Teenage ‚Äì The only thing that matters are grades at this point. Sports? Not for you. Music? Weak hobby. Art? That‚Äôs for transgenders. Comparisons begin with sharma ji‚Äôs beta. Pretty soon, you realize school is not about learning but regurgitating information in a short amount of time. Many people get good grades but few have any curiosity and even fewer learn good civic sense. Teachers are abusive but it‚Äôs **YOUR FAULT** because **ELDERS CAN NEVER BE WRONG**.

&#x200B;

More Teenage ‚Äì You somehow get into college. Only options are medicine or engineering, otherwise you are out of the family because no one will marry you. You also realize that your parents don‚Äôt really love each other and try to emotionally blackmail you because you are the only reason they are together. Girls are to be avoided because they only want sex and are a distraction. Everyone (friends, families, distant relatives, neighbors) is in your business because **NOTHING IS PRIVATE**. You are responsible for family honor.

&#x200B;

Studenthood ‚Äì You go to college. You meet many indoctrinated kids but join the crowd because who are you. You (or at least me) grew up with few female interactions and fail miserably at getting a girlfriend because you are too shy. By the time you get your act together, you are 22. At least you made some good mates.

&#x200B;

Adulthood ‚Äì You become an Engineer or Doctor **BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES IT**. You probably get a job. A high paying job. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much you work, what you do, or if you enjoy it because only **MONEY MATTERS**. If you don‚Äôt get a job, it is your fault because you weren‚Äôt competitive in the rat race.

&#x200B;

Now you are expected to marry a women significantly younger than you, from a (very) similar background, is fair, very educated but also a housewife. **TROPHY WIFE**. You will be expected to live with your parents who will control your adult life just like their parents did to them. Your new goal is to get to America/Canada/UK **BECAUSE INDIANS BRING THE BEST CULTURE**. Even if you don‚Äôt make it, anyone who you know does is automatically a good friend that lives abroad.

Damn. I must have missed that one. TL;DR : Indian males gaand marao as usual. You can do whatever you want after you turn 18 but you‚Äôre not going to do it, because you want their money. You want to live in their house, want them to pay for everything, and feed you but expect them to do all this without expecting anything in return.

I agree with most of the things you said. We should learn from ourselves and provide a better life to the next generation. Art is for transgender‚Äôs??????????????? What about the stage when Indian men are incels till they get someone to marry them. That‚Äôs a big F for you brother...........stay strong Your entire post is full of cringe. As per your post, Life of an Indian Male is full of misery. Obviously our life is not as good as an average Male in the US for example. But its far better than an average Male in Africa, Pakistan, North Korea etc.


Edit: Let me add some more points.

An average US Male in his 20's is pressurized by the society to leave his parents and look for a job and live on his own. This could be incredibly stressful. 
In India, parents will support you and you can happily live in your parent's house without the society shaming you and save on rent. If you don't want to live with parents, you are free to do so in many cases.Parents will still send you money and give emotional support.
Reality is that there are challenges in every society, not just in India. So stop blaming the society and work on solving your problems.", Enli8ned throwaaway14342169 fuckjassi fairenbalanced NooJoisey spaceturd4 blinkinghell vidhikaaa manoflogan Franky-2002 None
PSA: Government hospitals are a perfectly viable alternative if you can't afford private hospitals,216,c9pwvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9pwvc/psa_government_hospitals_are_a_perfectly_viable/,65,1562419339.0,"There was a thread last night where OP's sister needed medical treatment and they didn't have money. OP in the thread flatly refused to go to a government hospital because he hadn't ""heard good things about them""

Then there were other people in the thread saying that you have to go to Apollo and Fortis and other fancy hospitals only if you have any medical issues.

I just want everyone to know some ground realities of government hospitals, especially in major cities:

1. The medical talent in top government hospitals is almost always the best in the city. The sheet variety of medical cases you get, plus the prestige of working in a top government hospital tends to attract really smart doctors. These doctors can usually leverage their position at a top hospital into a thriving private medical practice

2. Even the residents at government hospitals tend to be better since admission to a top hospital is extremely competitive. 

Government hospitals typically don't have good facilities and infrastructure. You also have to run around a lot to get things done. Which is why people prefer to go to private hospitals, especially if they have insurance.

But please know that the doctor's working at a top government hospital in a big city are all extremely qualified, and plenty of them also have an altruistic mentality.

 My FIL and uncle are both doctors are two major government hospitals and say this from experience. When literally the CM of the state needed some treatment, he came to my FIL, not some private hospital. When Jayalalitha was sick, my uncle was called in from his government hospital.

If you're in a major city and don't have money, go to your city's biggest government hospital. You won't be comfortable, but you will get good treatment",mrfreeze2000,Non-Political," Chennai‚Äôs public hospitals are quite good and attracts people from elsewhere in the state.

People living near Pondicherry also go to JIPMER which has very good doctors and facilities. And they are free. To add onto this, medical colleges are also a great place to go. It isn‚Äôt free, but it is affordable to most. My medical college charges about Rs 100 for a bed per night. I don‚Äôt have exact numbers for you, but most of our patients are working class people: farmers, daily wage workers, shop helpers, etc. If a patient can not afford treatment, we have numerous ways to get them the care they need. They can be booked as a teaching case for exams which gives them about 6-9k, a research case, which means all care compensated, or a pro bono case which means that doctors fees are not charged. Sometimes even after eliminating all hospital and doctor fees, the patient cannot afford subsidized medicine. I‚Äôve seen my professors pay out of their own pockets. I‚Äôve done it myself during MBBS.

This is at one of the best hospitals in the region and in the top medical colleges in the country.  

Contrary to what a lot of the country feels, most doctors are not cruel or thieves. You‚Äôll see a lot of good going around [deleted] My mother suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis and we have been visiting the local Rheumatologist for a few years. Lately, the flares have increased and the doctor seemed out of options to control her RA.

After some googling, I discovered AIIMS New Delhi has some of the top Rheumatologists in the country. So, I booked an appointment online(which is not at all easy) and the waiting period was 60 days.

60 days later, we reach the hospital and to our surprise, none of the faculty mentioned on the website were tending to the patients. Instead, the students of AIIMS who were pursuing masters were tending to the patients. Turns out the top doctors don't sit in the OPDs and you need to have some kind of influence in order to see them. 

This was my experience at one of the top public hospitals in the country. In the end, we ended up visiting Medanta anyway. I mostly go to govt hospitals for OPD purposes and the only issue I have faced in govt hospitals is long queues. Almost all doctors I have visited, I was satisfied by most of them. Especially, young doctors I have visited are mostly very patient. An additional factor is that the tests/medicines they write are conducted/available in the hospital itself, giving them no incentive to over-prescribe tests or  medicines.

(I don't have any experience of surgical procedures in govt hospitals) Speaking of Ambedkar Hospital OPD here. 

You *REALLY* need time and you have to take a day off. 

The good. 

* Everything was free (right from the consultation, blood test, and the medicines). A catch here, you cannot pick up the test results on your own, it is sent to the doctor you met and then the consultation will continue. The bad part about this is, you have to update your OPD form with the latest date for which you have stand in queue the next day, which means another full day lost. 

The bad.

* First you have to take an OPD form, the counter opens at 8AM but expect more than 40 people before you who are already in queue. 

* Next, you have to stand in a queue outside the doctor's room. Another 50 people will be there before. Luckily there were seats and it was air conditioned.

* There was a junior doctor (probably doing his internship) and another senior doctor (she) in the room. I didn't like the senior doctor's attitude asking the patient (you could make out he was illiterate), *""Tumhe itna bhi nahi maloom!""* duh! She wrote the medicine in the OPD sheet and then just flung it to the patient. Not handing but flung it. I didn't like that part one bit. 

* The hospital staff and their relatives/family had a separate ""staff waale"" line.

TL;DR: Go to a govt hospital if you want free medicines, check-up, and consultation and if have time in your hands. If you are expecting a royal treatment, it's not your place to go. Complaints? Forget about it. The security guards outside will throw you out of the line if you dare complain. What are the good public hospitals in Bangalore? I've had 2 very good experiences with govt hospitals:

1. My brother in law expired a couple of years back. But I was amazed at the cleanliness and quality of care he got from a government hospital in Delhi. Yes, they are overrun with patients. But the doctors are top notch.

2. My wife had ear pain last year, which persisted for more than 3 weeks. No private doctor or hospital could help. The government hospital doctor looked at her for 5 mins, asked his resident to do syringing, and she was healed. That's why we need good govt hospitals. All your points are valid. Except that good qualified doctors, even my batchmates prefer to work in a pvt setup. So the quality I would say is better now in pvt than govt  hospital, except for the central govt institutions. And there are some great pvt colleges which don't charge a lot, KMC Manipal is one I know where they have good rates and great facilities. Likewise St John's.
And honestly if you go to a govt College for minor ailments, you'll be treated by a resident or an intern. I won't complain because I also got to learn like that only. But there were so many people who created a ruckus because the unit chief wouldn't see them and it's not possible for the chief to see the whole 150-200 people that turn up for opd. So if anyone is ok with all of these, govt hospitals are great > The medical talent in top government hospitals is almost always the best  in the city. The sheer variety of medical cases you get, plus the  prestige of working in a top government hospital tends to attract really  smart doctors. These doctors can usually leverage their position at a  top hospital into a thriving private medical practice
  
This is true. Public hospitals most likely get more cases than their private counterpart, hence a good doctor (despite their caste/race/religion ) would have much more experience. Also they'll most like have knowledge on how to treat it while avoiding any unwanted surgeries if possible.
  
> Even the residents at government hospitals tend to be better since admission to a top hospital is extremely competitive.
  
Not entirely true. Had to go to safdarjung hospital few years back. The resident outright said I don't know how to do this. Didn't know how to properly place needles. Was a big eff up.
  
There's reservation in admission to hospitals. I'm not implying that the doctors joining via quota aren't good, but there are definitely people who are just not fit to be in that institution.P.S. That resident came in via quota.", Yieldway17 z3roTO60 None fuckingc00nt noob_finger2 pencil_the_anus braindead_in contraryview throawayman20 butterfinger001 LoneSilentWolf

Teachers at my little brothers school tortured him into mental illness what are my options legally.,610,cdgvzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdgvzg/teachers_at_my_little_brothers_school_tortured/,116,1563222784.0,"It started when my little brother was in 8th grade we sent him to tuition classes at one of his school teachers place very popular among that school, the teacher is a loud mouth and has a reputation of making fun of her pupils for shits and giggles, so she started picking on my brother about his weight as he was a skinny little kid calling him names like ""dandiya""  Single pasli etc along the lines making fun of him in front of everyone he became a punching bag for everyone this went on for god knows how long, after that he started creating a scene everyday about not wanting to go to school and tution, my parents being a typical middle class parents forced him to go thinking he is just being a bad kid not wanting to study until he reached his breaking point, he became violent and abusive to the point he started abusing my father we never dared raise our voice in front of him ever, it become worse as time passed even when we were laughing about completely unrelated topic he would assume we were mocking him and would throw a fit, its been three years he hasn't left the house flunked 10th boards and been on medication ever since, what boiled my blood is when one of his classmate got in touch with me about how he was tortured in schoool and told few instances where a teacher once cut his hair in class in front of everyone berating him while doing so and one time a teacher made to bring oil from canteen the one used for making vada and forcefully applied it to his hair, one time a teacher asked his classmates to slap him repeatedly for some shit also he was called names in front of tge whole class like Pagal, pscycho gadha and all that it really fucked me up how ge had to go through all that alone and we were on no help.
Is there anything legally i can do to bring the school and the teachers to justice?

If anyone knows any good psychiatrist please let me know.",apnatimekhayga,[R]eddiquette," Reading this boils my blood. If anything, we would like to support you financially if it helps your cause. Your brother's story reminds me of the one year (grade 4) I studied in India. Indian parents don't realize how crucial their kids' formative years are in their emotional and social development. By sending your kid to ""school"", you're literally leaving a little human brain to be experimented and impressioned by God knows what kind of people with what kind of backgrounds.

Upvoting for visibility. >how he had to go through all that alone and we were on no help. 

Focus on this.

> Is there anything legally i can do to bring the school and the teachers to justice? 

It will definitely allay some guilt the family must be feeling. Talk to any lawyer, he will give you a list of charges you guys can draw up against the teacher. This scumbag must be suspended. Reading this makes me incredibly sad. Even if legal actions were to be taken, she is unlikely to be put in jail and even if she loses her job she can still continue to teach. I had a similar past, one of the teachers from my very expensive private school started randomly saying that I eat my boogers in front of my class. She would randomly make me go and bring soap and would make me wash my habds and face in front of the whole class. She only stayed for about a year, until my second grade, but my classmates never forgot. The bullying that resulted caused me to have intense social anxiety and several other disorders. I could never really understand why she had it against me, I was only 7-8 years old. 

I wish you and your brother luck. I hope she rots in hell. There are very specific provisions in the Right to Education Act that prohibit this type of behavior. Such as:

&#x200B;

""No child shall be subjected to physical punishment or mental harassment.""

&#x200B;

""g) making the child free of fear, trauma, and anxiety and helping the child to express views freely.""

&#x200B;

Your specific state's Dept of Education should have issued guidelines about what these clauses mean. Tamil Nadu, for example, bans corporal punishment and gives examples about what constitutes mental harassment. 

&#x200B;

However, there are a number of hurdles to clear before one can bring these issues to court. You're supposed to first go to 1) the school's management committee, 2) the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, and/or 3) the ""nodal officer"" which is whoever in the govt got appointed to oversee grievances, which depends on the state. Only after working to find a solution with these guys can you really do much through the courts. These guys can also be corrupt beyond measure so you have to find the right outlets. If you don't know the system, this is HARD. The consequences for violating these norms can be as mild as disciplining the teacher, to as extreme as canceling the school's recognition. The outcome depends on the politics of the school: the more powerful the school and beloved the teacher, the harder a time you'll have. If the school is not big or influential and the teacher's not well loved by the administration, the easier a time you'll have. Unfortunately, it's hard to predict which of these scenarios is true.

&#x200B;

You \*may\* be able to get the police involved because last I checked, assault is a criminal offense (not just civil, which is what I outlined above). You've got a difficult case because it's not easy to prove, but it can be easier if you find other kids who experienced the same.  

&#x200B;

The teacher is, however, violating the Right to Education Act in an obvious way that's really easy to prove:

&#x200B;

""No teacher shall engage himself or herself in private tuition or private teaching activity,"" which means if she's running a tutoring business on the side that's also illegal. Get receipts and photos proving she was engaging in this activity. Go to her tuition center now and also take current photos. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Here's what I would do. It's a two-pronged approach--first, collect evidence of private tutoring as well as physical abuse. Go to the police station and file a complaint, all the better if you have multiple abused kids go with you. Then, contact a lawyer who should be able to draft a letter to the school demanding that the teacher be fired due to violating two clauses of the RTE. Should they fail to do this, the lawyer will go to the education authorities to raise the matter there, and finally the courts. If an amicable solution isn't reached, the lawyer should express a willingness to go after the school's recognition. It's not a very serious threat, but with any luck, the school will make the teacher quit rather than go through a drawn out, expensive process.

Schools also HATE bad press. Anything you can do to bring down the school's name will go a long way. If nothing happens, at the very least, write a bad Google review or anything that highlights your experience in the classroom for other parents to read when deciding where to send their own child. Afaik you can charge mental harassment/abuse on her and get her sued. Talk to a lawer. Firstly get him therapy. Make that bitch pay My wife is a Vice Principal in a renowned school in Mira Road. I suggest you log a formal complaint with the police immediately. This is disheartening to hear...I am sorry to hear about your brother and wish him recovery Whenever I read about abuse, bullying and harassment in school, it makes me wonder if I should get myself checked by a mental health professional. I mean, all this talk about social anxiety and stuff makes me wonder if bullying had a role in my introversion and lack of motivation to educate myself.

Somehow I made it to a literally world top-level foreign university even though my high school grades are actually shit other than two subjects that I actually enjoyed and applied to study. But even there I couldn't enjoy university, lost contact with the friends I made there, got a suspension for low GPAs/failing and didn't return when the suspension ended.

I went to the same school for 12 whole years. I faced a lot of abuse in class and on the way home in the bus. Several times I'd come home crying and beg my parents to change my school, but they didn't realise how bad it was and I got stuck there until I finished the entirety of my school life. I developed a very anti-bad behaviour/bad-manners attitude because of this shit.

In class 11 the bullying more or less stopped, but by then I had maybe two or three friends tops. Some ""friends"" they were though - the one person I trusted the most turned out to be a dick-bag behind my back. Probably because near the end of class 10 I told in public to the principal, in front of the entire class about how I felt about my time in school so far, with the principal then explaining to everyone that I was a victim of ragging. No further action was taken though, ever. Some people actually came up and told me that they didn't realise I was getting ""depressed"" by their attitude with me, even though I'd probably told them (actually literally in my case) thousands of times up until that point to not do shit I didn't like to me. EDIT: I should add that they still didn't take it seriously and the tone was very mocking.

God I know I wasn't a saint up until that point, but I know damn well that for all the abuse I received growing up, I gave out maybe a negligible fraction of it, and that was long AFTER these fuckers had turned me into a cynical little shit. Not that any of them had earned my sympathy.

I didn't have any hobbies I shared with people while growing up. I hated all the tennis and cricket classes I took as a kid. The one sport I actually enjoyed after it was introduced to my school, I wasn't allowed to continue in a serious manner. I could have possibly been a national level competitor in that, and maybe if I worked hard enough, even participate in international events. I won't be conceited enough to suggest today that I could possibly win against the creme de la creme, since that was a very young age for me, but I am confident I could've done well with training and experience. I won't name the sport, except to suggest that it is expensive, but expense wasn't the reason I was stopped.

I often find myself uncomfortable when facing new situations, to the point that I almost want to avoid all contact with the world. When I hear people laugh in my surroundings, I often get this irrational fear that they might be laughing at me or mocking me.

I hate that my work requires me to be gregarious. I hate that the hours can get really long. I hate that even after work eventually I'll have to keep thinking about work.

You know what the worst part is? Money does nothing to improve your confidence.

Fuck...I didn't realise I'd feel sad while writing this down. What I've written is 100% real and even if it is scrambled up it's a stream of all the negative emotions and thoughts that just pop out from nowhere and remind me of fifteen whole wasted years. There's a lot of shit I haven't mentioned and this doesn't even scratch the surface. The more I read as I type, so much shit comes out I don't understand when to stop adding content to the earlier paragraphs.

Why didn't I see anyone for help? Teachers were useless, and by the time I was in secondary school I'd given up on complaining. They just couldn't believe that I could face problems day in and day out.

By the time I'd gone through middle school, I'd stopped showing my horrible school life outwardly at home. I think I had a few nightmares where I got physically violent (my hands or legs would move even though I was asleep) or woke up trying to commit violence against those whom I felt had wronged me, but that's about it.

I did see the school psychologist in class 11, and told her how I wasn't able to get along with the class, and her suggestions were bizarre as hell. Like, ""smiling"" along with the retarded jokes made by my classmates, especially when I didn't find any humour in them? How does that help someone who is literally ignored for most of the day? I told her how I wasn't motivated to study and didn't do well in my school exams, and she called me lazy. I mean, bitch, how the fuck am I supposed to do well when I don't even like attending?

If someone was to meet me in person, I don't think anyone would think something is wrong with me. To an extent I've coped, but I still feel...perhaps traumatised is too strong a word...*damaged* by my formative years.

Normally I don't think about school. I pretty much shut it out of my life. Whenever I read these posts though, it brings back some of the sorrow and pain...

Even before this internet era, people bought stuff in a sale which they never wanted because ""maybe we will need it later"" or ""it's so cheap"".

I'm not like that but my mom is. I was tracking ipad pro 10.5,
Prior to sale its price was 50,800
During sale it went upto 53,000

Guess what? I just saved 53k. Steam sale is the same. I have bought around 200+ games on it, even though I have yet to play at least half if them. i waited until prime days to do my shopping. Saved ""a few grands"" Let me tell you something. These sales aren't even sales now. I had 3 things in my wishlist and for the prime day sale the prices have gone up. Whereas on regular day its cheaper than the sale. Very few things have good discount and I am pretty sure not many people are buying these. All they do is put sale on front page and increase original mrp and then cut off the price. Whats shocking is that on a sale day sometimes things are more expensive than the regular ones. So yeah. FUCK 'EM. People get so caught up in the 20% they will be saving that they forget about the 80% they are wasting on something they didn't even want. So i purchased 6 items yesterday
Ive been tracking these items for months(2 to be precise) i had wishlisted everything 

*2tb hard disk seagate backup plus, before sale 5499/- during prime day 4999/-

*Boat rockers wireless 225 before 1399/- during 999/-

*hp odessy bag before sale 1649/- during 1299/-

*boat rugged usb wire before 299/- during 99/-

*dragonwar levitan gaming mouse before 699/- during 525/-

*crocs slippers (no discount) 


I added and purchased exactly after midnight 
So i do think discounts are there if you have a prime(got it 2 days ago for this)

And hdfc got me 10% off on total so like 10k became 9k

And my items are out for delivery rn.

EDIT: got it, was suspecting defective items(happened with a phone last time), none Absolutely true. Savings matter a lot now a days. Only buy if you need and not because some sale is going on ! [deleted] THIS.

The fact that he is not behind bars baffles me.

What money can do in India! Quite elitist of you to think that the blue-collar people will never evolve in their cinematic taste. The market for cheesy escapist movies is comprised of people from all demographics. Its our intellectual ego which makes us think that we are superior to others.

As for Anurag Kashyap, its been ages since he made a masterpiece. It is NOT an unpopular opinion if you take the total population of India into account. Infact, it is the exact opposite. The majority crowd of our country loves bhai and his movies.

Reddit contains Indians who are more progressive and who have lived lives with a better exposure as compared to the average population. Therefore, Indians on reddit know that there are wayyy better movies than bhai movies.

I hate bhai movies and his acting and bhai the person  with all my heart. But his movies won't go away because the crowd who likes that kind of movies is just too large.

Agree or Disagree : The extremely slow legal system is the biggest reason that is hampering the progress of our country.,212,caxj21,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/caxj21/agree_or_disagree_the_extremely_slow_legal_system/,94,1562685644.0,"I have always believed if there is a faster legal system, India as a whole will improve dramatically. Even simple corruption cases takes decades to resolve and this gives criminals to commit crimes because they know they can be out on bail for decades. 

Look at the famous case of Jasleen Kaur molestation case. She is alleged to have falsely accused a man 4 years back. The case is stuck in a limbo because she has left to a foreign country 3 years back while the guy has to go to the court every month. If this happens with even a small case like this, imagine how long it will take to give verdicts on murders and rapes.",LoganVegeta,[R]eddiquette," Keep in mind that when you think of legal system, you usually think of criminal cases.

But a massive part of the legal system is dealing with civil cases. And our legal system is as slow, and even slower, in dealing with them.

This affects businesses a LOT. Contracts are a joke in India because dragging people to court means spending years getting anything done. In fact, one of the reasons why the US is so good at business is that contracts get honored there because otherwise you can go to the court. Criminalization of politics is the biggest problem. Once criminals enter politics they have no incentive to have an independent functioning judiciary to perform to it's strength. Maybe we should stop electing criminals. But then for that to happen basic service delivery should be good starting from law and order. That can happen only when police are released from political control and judiciary is allowed to function normally 

Back to square one. Absolutely. Crime rates can only be reduced by improving the enforcement of existing laws. > India ranks 62 out of 113 countries in the Rule of Law Index. On specific indicators such as order and security, civil justice and fundamental rights, India ranks 98, 97 and 75, respectively.

> With over 56 lakh cases pending for over five years, few citizens rely on the judiciary to resolve their disputes. Forty per cent of the judicial positions in High Courts are vacant . The percentage of undertrials in India is 67, which is double the global average. A recent BCI survey discovered that over 60 per cent of the lawyers practising in India are fake. The cost of judicial access is exorbitant.

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/reimagining-indias-judicial-system/article25625586.ece/amp/


We rank third from last in the number of judges per million ranking in the world.



This is intentional fuckup created by Indian elites. If you are rich, you can easily get bail, there is zero chance you will be convicted for crime. But poor will be jailed without trial for years.



Remember, Congress government was there for ten years. They could have appointed judges, they could have added more police. They didn't because current system works very well for Indian elites. No. It's population. Everything else is a byproduct. our legal system was best for a time when we are under British. Present legal system does not reflect the realities of the present conditions. The most significant bottleneck in the legal system is shoddy law enforcement investigation agencies. In short, disagree.

If the courts processed cases faster (and accurately, as opposed to some of the bizarre decisions we see once in a while), the country would improve a lot, sure. But the doddering legal system's sluggish pace is definitely not the biggest for our India's slow progress. And why is the legal system so slow? Not because it is designed to be so slow, but because of the sheer volume of cases that are in it. And I concur with whoever said our population is the biggest problem for India. The whole idea of a demographic dividend because of a large young population is eyewash that is unfortunately widely believed.

For instance, the more the number of people, the larger the number of legal cases, and therefore the bigger the number of courts, judges and lawyers needed to deal with those cases. But you can't just make people judges and lawyers without adequate training, and for that training, you need schools and colleges. But where do you get the land and money and staff for so many educational institutions? And even if we somehow managed to get our illiterate and impoverished millions (yes, there are more people starving in our country than the populations of over 100 countries; how can anyone reasonable argue our population is not a HUGE problem?) into these institutions, there is no guarantee they will ever graduate or have any aptitude for law. How do you think the legal system will suddenly become faster?

One of the foundational principles of legal system anywhere is the due process of law, and by its very nature and definition, it can sometimes be slow. The law holds an accused innocent unless her/his guilt can be proven with an overwhelming degree of certainty (absolute evidence is almost impossible). And providing that proof is sometimes a time-consuming process. Would you rather have a guilty person go to jail or a company wrongly fined, all for the sake of a speedy judgement?

I feel the bigger problem with the legal system is how it is in theory meant to be equal for all, but in practice, works differently for those with money/power versus those without. And that is very different from the system being slow. How can she just avoid going to court ? Disagree.

It's because of everyone's distrust in business and free markets.

Everybody wants govt. to provide jobs, salaries, pensions, increments, free healthcare, free education without any effort but they do not want a fast justice system. Otherwise, it would have happened. Whatever the govt. touches, will die or deteriorate. But nobody wants to take responsibility for their own self, so you get this clusterfuck. Biggest wonder to me-

A female friend is being harassed verbally by some perverts next door. What do we do?,200,ccz4zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccz4zj/a_female_friend_is_being_harassed_verbally_by/,48,1563108774.0,"I have this friend living at a housing society at Kolkata, let's call her Arushi. Arushi is the sole occupant of her flat which is on the 4th floor and her only floor neighbour is a drunk, pervert 50 year old, let's call him Manu. The balconies and windows of the two flats are adjacent so whatever is loud enough at Manu's flat, is audible at Arushi's. He likes to sit at his balcony and yell curses about what not and initially, it was just random stuff he's pissed about and his language is the foulest you can imagine, copulating with people's mothers, etc. He tried to initiate conversations multiple times with Arushi but she, of course, avoided him the best she could. She even spoke to Manu personally, very politely about how she finds his language excruciatingly foul and requested him not to do that. Then soon enough, the yelling and cursing quickly descended down to expressing his sexual desires for her in the cheapest ways you can imagine (she even hesitates to describe the exact stuff he says). This will go on for hours on end, every other day. As if this wasn't enough, he will have his merry brand of fellow perverts and get drunk at his flat who all will come and knock at Arushi's door to make things even more difficult for her. Eventually, she went to the police once, they just left the guy with a warning. The events continued, she went to the police the second time, the cops came to the guy's place and left after a bit more serious warning. And then the events continued (the warnings seem to have no effect on him), and one night, when the scenario remained on resume, she had to call the cops and they came and took the drunks away and they were back soon enough again (seemingly, they again, had been just left with some threats and let loose once they were sober). And now they are back at it, yet again. These events span the duration of 3-4 months and obviously, Arushi doesn't feel safe at all having to live in perpetual fear when she has to leave or enter her room having to come across the douchebags, drunk, with their door left wide open. Since the official police warnings have had no effect and even the police doesn't seem to care enough, we are clueless on what to do about this. Woman helplines, reachout centers, the right people to talk to? Any sort of leads or help is appreciated.
Thank you.",radjeep,[R]eddiquette," Complaint to higher authorities, The SP/DCP and tell them. Also make sure you just don't go to the police. You have to file an FIR, get a copy and then ask the status of the FIR every time. That's the only proof you will have of police inaction. Tell her to install a security camera facing his way, just the balcony, not his house. Let him know that his behaviour is being recorded 24x7, so she has proof to show to the cops.

Relocate , tweet to mamta didi , women's cell Its a pity, we can‚Äôt rely on Police and have to find a way to resolve it ourselves. If she is living on rent, try finding another apartment. If leaving is not an option, try emailing higher authorities with all sorts of proof and video if possible. Tag on Twitter as well. Can some body move in with her another girl for instance.

HUGE Organized rally planned by interns from NRS to CNMC today at 4:30 pm/ 5pm [cant seem to get the correct timing]


[A summary of sorts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I11P858n6GQ)


Edit: A Journalist contacted me to use my megathread :D",BaidDSB,[R]eddiquette," I'm not even sure what the TMC, particularly Mamata is arguing about. The demands are fair regardless of which angle you look at it from. We don't have any political affiliations, nor are we siding with any parties. And we don't care about our patients' religious beliefs. Worship who you will.

Get your shit together woman. As per Indian Express report, this year itself in 5 months there have been 100+ attacks on doctors in Bengal itself but hardly any action taken.

So it was a matter of time these protests happened. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I11P858n6GQ Any updates on those protesting docs injured by the mob? All that needed to be done was visit the injured doctor, make some empty assurance about increasing security, wait for another incident and then repeat the same jumla./s

Mamta banarjee instead made it into bangla vs outsider issue.Now she is being asked to apologize too.Nope, better to release TMC goons and police on the doctors. [removed] As a physician in training in India,  let me add more -

The protest is completely justified.  We doctors are studying one of the most difficult professions in this world which keeps on changing and new stuff gets added every few months.  Medical science is NOT magic.  we are NOT so advanced that we can cure everything or revive everyone.  Sorry for your stupid movies but CPR doesn't have a 100% success rate.  All infections don't get cured by their respective drugs.  All surgeries dont succeed.  And most importantly,  all diseases dont get diagnosed correctly because this is real world.  Things don't present in textbook way. 

People only see when someone can't be saved.  They don't see how. Many are saved.  Do you idiots have any idea what was the life expectancy at independence?  Under 40. Today it is 65-67. That is an achievement of humanity.  Today you don't see leprosy,  TB,  polio etc. as frequently as you would. Have seen earlier.  Today people don't die of a sore throat ( yes it is entirely possible for you to die with a sore throat acting as initiator). 

So people,  THIS PROFESSION IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO GOD.  Doctors DESERVE the respect and money for what they do.  Do you guys realise how. Cheap. Government services are in India compared to US? There a single ED visit can equal your annual income.  Here it's quite less.  Even in private here,  a single ED visit after an accident/injury can be just 2k-3k. That's cheap considering how it is in America.  So count your blessings. 

And finally a single thing.  All of you who say doctors take a lot of money should realise that you are absolute. hypocrites.  You say doctors should treat for. Free and all...  What abt their families?  Why should ONLY THEY be restricted?  Why don't you start. Giving your monthly. Income to charity?  I mean you are a human being as well.  Isn't it your duty?  So yeah jab baat. Khud par aati h na samaj seva karni ki,  toh the way you all run is hilarious.  Doctors deserve that money for the effort they put in and for the risk and responsibility.  We ARE NOT CHARITY.  ( I agree. that sometimes the fault IS of. Doctor but that is what courts and medicolegal cases are. for. Dumbass.  And most are won by doctors only because judge and expert opinions realise that doctors always treat by the standards and it is NOT PERFECT.  It is the patient who is misinformed and think universe uska kutta h jo sab ho jayega. They think everything happens for them only. Live in reality ) 

So yeah,  have some brain before speaking and don't be a typical hypocrite Indian. 

It hurts to see poor people getting affected by strikes but IT IS. NECESSARY.  If we can't be content on our safety,  then their is no point in being a healer.  And those who have problem with it,  join karlo aake.  Itna resign ho raha h,  you are free to join. Mamta Banerjee has handed this very poorly. Giving out inflammatory statements when she should have controlled the escalating situation. She's adding fuel to the fire. She needs to tone down with public statements. I am a second year MBBS student, and I totally support the protest that we should get much better conditions in the govt hospitals for our safety and security . > 69 DOCTORS RESIGNED FROM RGKAR MCH. will post the article when it goes live.

Here you go: https://www.firstpost.com/india/doctors-strike-live-updates-80-medicos-mass-resign-from-kolkatas-rg-kar-medical-college-demand-mamatas-unconditional-apology-6811951.html There is a rally organized in support of the doctors and it is right now moving from NRS to Park Circus. The rally has students from Presidency University, Jadavpur University, Calcutta University, some civil society members, students from other college campuses in Kolkata and a substantial number of professional doctors from private hospitals.      

My brother and my aunty are in the rally. Just got a call from my brother.  
I heard a very common slogan that we use to hear during hok kolorob movement in 2014 ""amra kara bohiragoto"" (means who are we - the outsiders). This was a slogan we had used in JU 2014 when TMC referred to the students from Presidency helping out in the movement as outsiders.      

And for anyone that cares/has interest in student movements in Kolkata. This one like Hok kolorob is also student lead and an independent movement. While BJP might have people in the rallies but the people leading the movement are again students - general students. There is possibility some of the leadership might belong to nondescript independent unions but neither can I find that out now/ nor can I possibly explain what they are.   

Might got down to one of the campuses in the evening - if I have some more information about the organizers of the movement, I will post. If she has any sensibility left, she should come out in support of Doctors rather than threatening them for appeasement politics.", mfoxin GreatAd8 Daniel-Darkfire amntrashu None heteretes Umersulemanchoudry DrAwesome04 GreatAd8 kewra_bangali Famateur
Uber driver scammed me by not picking me up and completing the trip. Uber is not helping me here.,101,cc6wf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cc6wf1/uber_driver_scammed_me_by_not_picking_me_up_and/,59,1562939625.0,"Yesterday it was raining heavily and needed to book cab 2kms from my location cuz of my parents. Driver called me and asked for my location(nearby but a u-turn). The cab never came. 10mins later I see the trip is completed. Uber says the location data of pickup and drop off matched mine and co-rider's(pool) and refusing to refund me. It was around 300bucks because of rains and its a pretty huge amount for me.

What are my options? My payment is not deducted yet as method was card payment. At this point I'd rather pay a new sim costs and make a new account. 

The driver has a 4.3rating, lowest I've ever seen and quite possible hes scamming people with low distance trips by ignoring  u-turns and starting trips without riders. It fools the location data.",uberscamthrowaway,[R]eddiquette," In your case, the driver might have come near your location and made a false trip from there. Hence uber thought you're the one at fault. Shitty driver. While booking on uber, keep your eyes on the booking screen. If the trip started without you, you'll know. Contact uber at that moment itself. 

Ola is better in this respect. OTP system makes sure you're in the car. A lesson I learned from using cabs often is that I prefer Ola just because of the fact that it has the OTP system and I can immediately call customer care (they have the option in their app). This way, the chances of driver fucking me over are minimized. For Uber, I try as much as I can to pay by cash.

Another thing I do is, I mean, I don't care if people judge me or something, but if my driver has a low rating (lower than 4.5) and I am at a fix (stuck in the rain, late-night, no cash, etc.) I just cancel and rebook till I get a better driver. I have enough things to deal with already then to run after these people for their mistakes. your phone would have location data to prove your side.  
use that. In Ubers case, a tweet to their support and uber India has always worked for me. Uber India is a pain in the ass. I booked a cab from South Delhi to Ghaziabad, fell asleep in the back seat and woke up passing Mahipalpur. Driver said he needed money for ""gas."" Took multiple support messages for a rep to refund my trip, even though my vehicle was going the complete opposite direction of my destination. 

Just be persistent. As others recommended, message theme on Twitter and on Facebook, too. They've always caved for me. Nowadays, I feel they're quite quick to issue refunds, regardless of country. If you used UPI/debit card or credit card to pay for it then file a dispute with your bank. Gaand phat jayegi unki.

If you used Paytm then RIP. Same happened with me once. Just that I was liable to pay 38 rupees because uber auto. But nevertheless Uber customer service is worst and I only got the standard replies and those also stopped coming after 10 days. Had to bear the loss. I would say All the best and keep us updated. Tweet Uber! 
You would be surprised how these people care about their social media presence. *u/uberscamthrowaway*

xD Uber doesn't have a customer care. All things are handled by their ""software"" signing different names in each reply. You have better chances talking to their twitter team.

I deleted my account and would never in my life use any Uber service. They are a shitty company and they provide shitty service. OLA is miles ahead in this regard.

So many consultancies are trying to dupe students/freshers looking for jobs. This is what happened to me.,302,c84t0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c84t0z/so_many_consultancies_are_trying_to_dupe/,65,1562070737.0,"I am looking for a job while currently pursuing my masters. Since i graduated in economics with no technical skills in hand, the majority of jobs being offered to me are crappy BPO and backend ones. 

Me and my friend who's in the same boat decided to apply on job portals and we start getting all sorts of calls hiring for voice/non voice process. Some of them were bonafide but i think, majority of them were from fraud consultancies. I got an offer for an interview in Delhi's Badarpur and accepted to come for the interview. The day before, i was wondering that nothing good has ever happened in Badarpur and did a quick google search only to find a consumer complaint filed against the 'consultancy' that i was going to. 

A few days later, me and my friend got another offer for an interview in two consultancies that were in very close proximity to each other. We, being the idiots we are, forget to double check and went to the agencies the next day. I, although asked everything about any hidden charges and ofcourse she lied.


The one i went to made me wait for about half an hour for the interview, i have given interviews before and knew this is not how it works. *Mujhe pata chal gaya tha mera chutiya kat chuka hai.* The interviewer was hardly 10th pass who was struggling to ask questions in English and the moment she uttered i can offer you 35k, i knew this is a scam and she's about to ask me for money which she did. There's no way i can get 35k even if i sold my body to a pimp. So i stormed out of there and called my friend.


What happened with him is more interesting, when they asked him for money, he got himself out by saying he need some time to think. He went down to smoke and he saw three police officers marching towards the building. The moment they saw my friend they asked ""how much we they asking?"". My friend replied 10k but he gave them nothing. He showed them the way inside the building.


So my friend was sitting outside the room where the interviews took place watching the entire raid taking place. A BTech graduate who paid 2k rupees as 'security' to the the frauds comes after giving a ""telephonic interview"" and says to my friend *bhut tough interview tha, aadhe ghante grill kia*. The police officer shouted from inside *koi interview nahi tha, iska pati hai vo*. This poor delusional guy was still under the impression that he'll get the job untill everything was explained to him.  He gave the lady 2k rupees which the police got back from her.



Any adequately informed job seeker who has given at least one interview knows that only frauds asks money from candidates but i guess there are still people who in desperation, will oblige and pay.

I also feel like an idiot for not cross checking this time and believing everything she told me over the phone like no hidden charges etc.


This all happened 2 days ago and i have another interview lined up later today for a fairly good profile (no BPO/backend crap) after clearing an online test for it. It's the real deal and it'll give an okay start to a fresher like me.

That said, i still feel like an idiot that i went there and waited 30 minutes only to get conned.",akki95,[R]eddiquette," if they ask for money, it's never a job.        
had that happen to me so many times, it's ridiculous.         
I still get calls telling me that they have my interview setup at xyz MNC and I just need to pay a fee.         
Bullshit.

edit : just received another one of those sms. I'm happy to know that they are at least being raided. A friend of mine had paid ‚Çπ22k to a guy promising him a job. Now this friend knew that there are scams like this in the market but still fell for it. And he only disclosed it to us only after the guy ran away with the money. >*bhut tough interview tha* 

poor guy Same happened to my collegemate, he was so dumb that he took ‚Çπ5k from ATM to give it to them. It was a shady building in Nehru Place and had good reviews on Google with same comments by all. Turns out that it was a BPO that promised tech jobs. We 3 guys were checking out laptop stuff and then we see this guy taking out money from ATM. We then ask him what for and then save his ass and also the other guy a jaat, gave some gaalis and showed them their aukat. Damn. As someone from the tech side of things, I feel slightly better. Thanks for sharing this. This happens a lot. I have had phone conversations with people who said you have to pay x amount of money to the consultancy and when I and go and look up the consultancy website, it's a generic webpage. A lot of these consultancies disguise their jobs as real ones on job boards. it happened with me and the building in which the interview was scheduled was so old that i knew its all a scam. Nonetheless i went in and when they asked for money i said i have ‚Çπ20 and can give them ‚Çπ10 to which they agreed and i was laughing my ass off. OP, if you're interested in learning how to code, you can PM me in about a month or so after I graduate, I'll be free for about two months before I start working and it will be nice practice for me to teach someone coding from scratch. That said, if you do take up the offer, I will expect complete dedication from your part.

Backstory : I helped my batchmates who knew absolutely nothing about code get into the Indian mass recruitment companies in a couple of weeks. Haha,  
So Similar thing happened with me too. I was fresh out of college and was looking for a job. I got a call from one of these consultancies, It was in Laxmi Nagar, New Delhi. So, I reached there at the exact time. It was on top of some new building, in a very small room. The sight of small office ticked me off, but I decided to stay. There were 4-5 more candidates waiting there. They made me wait for 2-3 hours then I was called inside. A lady in a suit pant was taking interview. She took my resume and asked everything from it (For ex: If ""Java"" was written on my resume, she'll ask what is ""Java"" etc. ), then she tells me ""You're selected for Software Engineer Position in HCL, you'll have to pay 1K for Registration and another 1K for Security Check from Police. After this is done, you'll get a call from HCL and You'll join at your preferred Location"".   
Now, look. I am a fresher, that doesn't mean I am dumb. It's simple logic. If an MNC like HCL wants to hire you, they'll do it on their own cost. Not Beg for Rs. 2000/-. So, I said, ""Mam, I don't carry cash around, as I am fresher and don't have much money, to begin with."" She was not letting me go that easily. She then said, "" You can go to the nearest ATM, someone will accompany you, You can hand over the money to them."". I was like wtf. how to get out of this situation. I went to the ATM and after just typing random keys, I came out in 2 mins and said to that person that, ""I think My younger brother took out the money,  we share one account. I'll come back in a day or two as soon as I receive money"" and I got away from there. Oh man.. I just gave more than 8 thousand to some job service and they said I got the job in a big MNC and the company will contact me in 3-4 days. They said 2000‚Çπ were for form filling charges and 6250‚Çπ for background verification. I gave money through UPI not cash.  I knew it might be a scam but I was desperate. I hope it's not a scam. I got offer from lasren toubro, i just had to pay 30 K.", aadharshbalak Injinear poplullabygirl ssj_cule PM_ME_YO_SWAG deep639 GudBug the_confused_adult sir_banana_nana ILikeAshwal iamhunting

Shows the ground reality. Also I had never known all my life about that lawyer who drew the border of my country and fucked it up. Power in wrong hands can destroy centuries together and affect the people who aren‚Äôt even born yet. Stories of partition still gets me into tears. It has been 70 years and I have no relatives, land or anything across the border. It would have been really traumatic for the ones who actually faced it PS- All those shots from within Pakistan were by someone else, Johnny was denied visa to enter Pakistan. The Video call was a surprise for sure, but a welcome one. Borders and earworm are my favourite series from vox. 
This was fantastic ! Vox borders series are something need to be cherished. I wish I seen such videos during my geography classes. One of favourite channel. I'm so happy he showed both PMs and how they incite violence for political gain. Noone can dare to do this in India.

Women arent pure and innocent goddess. Its time they are critiqued equally as men.,282,bzaor9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bzaor9/women_arent_pure_and_innocent_goddess_its_time/,230,1560277178.0,"I'm a single child and I'm an introvert. And my hobbies except gaming are mostly things I do alone. So I have always been a bit awkward around people. Never had much friends etc.

So anyway. First year in college was hard. Ragging and stuffs.Management is ignorant as is the norm in this country. 

So this girl from my year once texted me on FB to ask for songs.Never before a girl msgd me so it was exciting.We talked a bit, i found her taste in music and anime very much like mine so we hit it off.  this went on for about 45 days.
She suddenly proposed me to be her bf.I was flabbergasted.I liked her too but it wasn't even close to be in a relationship.
But I accepted.The greatest mistake of my life.


Anyway I made a gf without much friends.Few months after that, she started for hugs and kisses. I wasn't  ready at all but didn't want to lose her so I went along.That increased to more physical stuffs but I put a check
Thing about girls throwing themselves at you is that you kinda want to enjoy a bit too.
8 months after she proposed, things started to break apart.Fights cries blaming etc.I thought it was my fault so I wanted to hold on.16 months in, we broke up.


Now within 1 month she was in a relationship with one of my better friends.Naturally I was devastated.Depression ensured.Took meds and stuff.Since then I realized my friends are avoiding me.Didn't know why.

One day me and his new guy had a big fight in college because he was trying to insult me in front of everyone else in teh canteen and i had enough.
Later that evening She sent me an email saying that if I do anything about this she's gonna go to the police about how I forced her to be physical.
I still keep that email as evidence.


For over 2 years I spent alone in college.No one talked to me. Lost all my good friends. Those who did were asked why they spoke to me (learned this from a good friend who wasn't a part of the big group and helped me with my problems) much later...


Joined interneship. Determined to make things right with people.Wasn't easy but I made people saw I'm not a bad person.Suddenly my popularity skyrocketed. Everyone was cool with me and wanted me around. 

The shock isn't here yet. Wait.
Middle of internship. Those 2 broke up.People were turning against them before internship in final year because they aren't pleasant people [i dint even know because i was always alone for the whole 8 hours of college, everyday and im an ignorant fool]. And being great in computers I did official stuffs for college like some IDA stuffs for publicity etc. I gained a lot of friends because apparently if the management and the teachers like you, other people start doing too. Then I was told what happened.

My ex didn't even like me.When we first joined college, she liked him [her crush, the new ex].
But he was a very good looking guy and she wasn't. So he didn't pay much attention to her.
She was desperate for a relationship but no boy was falling for her tricks of physical signaling, constant texts and touching. I did without realizing [again, ignorant fool].
So she used me for physical pleasure.
And to make the guy jealous who was starting to like her.
Eventually he fell for her and she spit me out like bubble gum.
And then for 2 years she told all college people, Seniors and juniors too that I mistreated her and used her physically.I guess the final win was mine because I ended the most popular of the 3.Took me years to get out of depression.


I wrote this before too. But the few new posts about how women get affected, there's this other side of the coin too. Pseudo feminists and entitled women were running wild in yesterday's post. 

If men can be critiqued for just asking for an answer [a SIMPLE NO], women should be held accountable too, which sadly doesnt happen.

PS: I glossed over a lot of things, like my extreme family situation 2 years ago. So i had to deal 2 whammies at the same time. 

2018 was a hell of a year though. Cleared off my depression and regained confidence to forget my lost years. Im still thankful to my friends and my mom who helped me through this period.",BaidDSB,[R]eddiquette," Wow, this subreddit is becoming a gold mine for drama. I feel like I can't relate to either side, really. I never bothered about girls in my teenage years. After going to college, a girl asked me out but I kinda messed that one up really badly.

I feel like the situation is getting better as I grow older. Still don't really care about girls, but sometimes a little fun is good. A long term relationship is out of the question for me until I graduate and get a job.

I guess I've been lucky to not meet that many shitty people in my life. Girls think boys are out to get them and boys think girls are stuck up bitches. Every discussion about this gets too heated for actual debate because people feel personally attacked. Only the weaboos are happy with their 2D waifus lol. > **She** suddenly proposed me to be **his** bf

Welcome to Thailand Women are people too. Sometimes people are shit. The end. Guys a introvert, plays video games, watches anime and  women are texting him first on Fb and then asking him to be his boyfriend .Fuck my self-improvement journey. >**She** suddenly proposed me to be **his** bf   
  
Was your signal something was wrong. /s  
  
Enjoy, make money, be successful, don't be in a hurry to find someone What I believe is that this kind of behavior is a human thing. Not a gender thing. People are bad. Not girls, or boys. People.

However, I must add, from stories heard from my immediate friends, and friends of friends etc, I know for a fact that more girls have cheated on their boyfriends, as compared to dudes cheating on their girlfriend. DUDE, PUT A FUCKING SPACE AFTER A PERIOD FOR GOD‚ÄôS SAKE!!! Quora, is that you ? What is this, a crossover episode ? It's not about any gender or any race. Anyone can be bad. A whole of something cannot be considered bad or good. And yes we do have the right to criticise anyone if they do shit on purpose, no exceptions. 

op your problem is very different than problem listed by girl yesterday, girls are culturally  oppressed and many guys take advantage of this thing to molest the mentally and physically >If men can be critiqued for just asking for an answer \[a SIMPLE NO\]

I think you missed the point of those posts. It wasn't feminism. No one was critiquing men for asking for an answer. Those posts just explain why you may not get a simple no - ever, and that situation is unlikely to change anytime soon. The best strategy is that anything other than a 'simple yes' is to be construed as a no. It will make your life easier.

If there's even a one-percent chance that some guy will take a simple no badly, why would a womanwant to take that risk? The guy's mental issues are not the woman's responsibility. They have every right to be selfish in this case.

>women should be held accountable

Accountable for what? In your case, a woman manipulated you for her own amusement. She should definitely be held accountable. But the thing is, people will say that it's just one woman.

Now I know that in the absence of any clear statistics about how women behave, everyone of us goes by anecdotal evidence. It neither wrong nor right because there's simply no other way. But overall, not just women, but people in general are not inherently evil by nature.", skoomaspam icicibank sparoc3 vijju9 LoneSilentWolf Vader44 liberalindianguy notdheeraj Amanitg10 2beec Gideon_Nomad

Not only did she throw acid on him, but she also convinced him someone else did it too! What a pyscho This is horrible > now he'll marry me Whats with India and acid? Can you really do that to someone if you really loved him/her. I think many of us still dont know the difference between \`love\` and \`possession\`. The roots of this are in the gunda culture that we delhiites grow up in. By the time you're a 15 year old, you start commanding respect for being ""backed"" by large groups of gunda friends who would come help you in case of a fight. You're a wuss if you don't have a ""back"". 

So many teenagers are growing up with the notion that big strong bullies with ability to gather gunda friends on demand are the ones that command respect. 

I know people who never got over this idea and they are into their 30s now. Well, well, well, how the turntables. Why should boy's have all the fun? /s We've come full circle..

OK with every single point save ""not bathe"". And yeah, **ck religion. [deleted] But isn't that her choice, just like Zaira? /s

Seriously, this is brainwashing of the highest level. Nothing more. Any Jains here who support this? This is Child abuse. I have been waiting for someone to pick this topic up. Sadly, Jainism doesn't attract much criticism for some unfathomable reasons. There's a rampant wave of teenagers becoming monks, at least in Mumbai where I live. Its crazy and horrifying. 

&#x200B;

These white clad monks brainwash their followers by paraphrasing their scriptures in fluent English. Their system is flawed just like every other religion. In my opinion, they're not great just because they renounce all materialistic things in life. There's no substance to their reasoning. They don't accept food from anyone who's not Jain. That's discrimination there itself. Also, everybody needs food to survive. They should earn their bread by sweating instead of cashing in on their monkhood, which contradicts their claims of non-materalistic life in the first place. Its easy to pretend to be on spiritual journey when your monkhood ensures food and shelter. 

&#x200B;

Coming back to the crazy trend, Jain communities treat these monks as gods. No surprise their kids aspire to become one. They hold grand ceremonies to give farewell to the kids who wanna be monks. That is an outright mental abuse of teenagers. FFS someone should raise voice against it.  Jains have little to no history of reform or revolution in their practices at massive scale through means of criticism, protest or upheaval. Recipe for most regressive practices in the system. It feels so disheartening watching all these talented kids renounce everything & that too for what? Inner peace? Soul searching?

What a difference those kids could have made to the world‚Ä¶ I have a contrarian take on this. This may well be the route to a happier life than the life led by the average person.

The other point is that the kids are too young to decide. But aren't they also too young to decide they want to live the default life chosen by our society? We are all also equally brainwashed since young to be materialistic and value certain things over others.

>The Opposition has more PM aspirants but the focus now is on keeping the flock together




https://m.telegraphindia.com/india/mayawati-to-back-opposition-coalition-if-made-pm/cid/1691039 National Herald is unironically calling it a [moral victory](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/amp/story/opinion%2Fnot-a-ruthless-election-machine) for RaGa. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Looks like the next elections will deliver a Congress mukt bharat. Wasn't the social media manager of Congress going to do 1 more ama after the results? Things opposition has to improve :

1. They need to get rid of nepotism, at least at the top. Most of parties in MGB are dynastic and have history of corruption. Do away with old guard and bring in some fresh blood and ideas. To do that these parties will have to adopt an internal constitution and processes to ensure rise of meritorious candidates. Currently, it seems impossible. 

 

2. Embrace true secularism i.e. stop pandering to a community for votebank. Support secular Uniform civil code and be adamant at separation of governance and religion.  

 

3. Do good work at the states where they are in power. Stop fighting elections on the failures of Modi, fight elections on your merits. 
 


4. Opposition also needs to identify the rotten apples and distance itself from them. Mamata has shown dictatorial tendencies and her party is famed for its use of violence. No need to establish ties with her. She will bring you down with her. Enemy of enemy is my friend doesn't apply in politics. Aligning with someone who has contrasting vision and aspirations sends mixed signals to the voter. 


5. Have a vision paper based on development, progress, true secularism, equality , national security and climate. Fighting elections purely on caste equations and quota promises will only get this far. Room for Caste politics is diminishing and in next 20 years, may start to become irrelevant. 


I can see opposition embracing 3 and 4, but not 1 and 2, therefore the opposition loses might keep on piling.


Edit : Added point 5


Edit 2: I voted for BJP because to me the alternative was a coalition of dynastic regional parties with history of corruption such as RJD, SP, BSP, DMK, CBN's party, TMC and that would have been catastrophic for our nation. 

If political parties implement the amendments that I have stated, then we have an excellent opportunity to elevate the political discourse and improve the governance. I don't favour any party. But this is bad for India, not because BJP got elected. But because there is a non-existent opposition party. Too much power at one party didn't always bode well for India.


One good thing about this election: dynasty politics getting obliterated. Rahul's resignation rejected.

Well, fuck.  \-Narendra Modi finishes thanking supporters and world leaders.

1st link is a survey of dreams which shows that our most common dream is failing to perform in university or high school exam. 2nd link offer a hypothesis that this might be due to the reason that as student you faced so much stress and anxiety related to exam. This shows how fucked up the situation is and there is a pressure cooker kind of stress on young persons with society and parents ready to bounce upon them on their slight failure. Whats sad is that most kids today assume that their life is decided completely by getting into an IIT or else it's bust. I blame the parents for this mentality. I would say that a lot of hypercompetitive parents are pretty immature and don't have any life experience themselves. They tend to coach their kid into believing that their life is over by they time they are 15-18. Couldn't be farther from the truth. Don't be these types of parents. Anybody has his entire letter/ dairy..I want to look this in his perspective...what went through his mind at that moment! its going to get even tougher, for everyone.

this is the truth, i have graduated in 18 in [B.tech](https://B.tech) Civil and since then i have been in delhi trying crack ESE. 

I would love to do [M.tech](https://M.tech) (got offers fro IISC Bangalore and IITM) but there are no job opportunities especially if you are from general category. Also i am the only child of my parents, and they have done everything for me, especially my aging father who have taken extension one after the other so that i can get a gov job & family would be less pressure. Wish we had better mental health help in India. 

It really sucks when a person suffering from depression, anxiety or any other mental health problem cannot get the proper care they need which leads them to take these extreme steps.

2. Terrorism is not in the interest of Pakistan (on our own land or on others land); we are focusing on economy.
3. Pulwama was a tragedy for the Indian people.  I asked for evidence and joint investigation between Pakistan and India. We are willing to help you in anyway. You don't have the right to be judge, jury and executioner on our land.
4. You challenged our sovereignty and violated LoC. We did the same. We wanted to show that we are also capable if you want to escalate things.
5. There was some conflict in the air; Indian people lost two aircrafts. Their pilots are with us.
6. Lets talk about our issues and focus on peace, not war. Things are escalating. I hope we don't go at war. Nothing good comes out of wars.

Edit: Seeing the released video of our captured pilot is so gut wrenching. I don't know what to feel.

Edit 2: At this point, with so much of false information being released, I'm beginning to question the evidence of every news report. Confused.

Edit 3: Lost one MiG 21, Pilot MIA confirmed during conference. 

Edit 4: 1 PAK AF Jet shot down confirmed during conference

Edit 5: 2 terrorists killed, confirmed or not? It was mentioned in the conference.  I can confirm that the captured pilot in the twitter video is indeed an Indian flying pilot. He is my classmates husband Abhinandan. I have attended their wedding and i do remember him very clearly. Please don't be war. Please.

This man was way ahead of his time. I cannot think of a name that has filled a void that Jaspal Bhatti's premature departure created.

Why he is not a household name like other sub par celebrities like Kapil Sharma and why dont we have Satirical shows like Jaspal Bhatti used to make back then?

He was a household name; even today anyone who is old enough will recognise him by name, even though he couldn't ever repeat the quality and success of Flop Show ever again. Flop Show and Office Office were undoubtedly the best satire shows on Indian Tv . Quality content, exceptional performances and highly relatable. The cringe worthy comic shows from today come nowhere close. [deleted] I have watched his work when I was a kid. He was active during the years 1985 to 2012. His work was majorly political satire and humorous shows depicting everyday problems middle class India faces.
I live in punjab so his death made headlines here and was a major accident.
As to why youngsters of our time do not know of him, this current generation is not aware of a lot of 90s and early 2000s television. They were simply too young during that time and they have now moved onto the stand up comedy brought on by shows like Laughter challenges.
Subtle comedy and satire is not popular in this generation. Over exaggerated stuff with way too many sexual references is the jam nowadays.
Clean humor is a dying thing.

Edit: I know that this is a generational thing and comedians of today will also face similar scenarios in the future. Artists come and go. Current generation just likes more of what they see in their own times. He was very much a household name for anybody who was watching tv in the 90s. Maybe not so much for the current generation. I'd wager Kapil will also be forgotten in 10 years. >  Jaspal Bhatti forms company & floats shares of GOLGAPPA WALAS

They're called water balls! I actually remember the thread on /r/india after his death. This was seven years ago so I might be misremembering things but I think the snoo avatar on this sub was changed in his likeness with a turban to honour him and it stayed that way for quite a while. Where can I watch his work? He was really a big name in Punjab, his movies like Mahaul Theek Hai and Jija Ji were great successes when I was growing up there and I loved them as a kid.

F. Did he finish the novel? Guys, if any of you have suicidal thoughts, seek help. If you can't afford it or that's not an option, make a throwaway (store the password on your phone) and post on r/suicidewatch. Just talk to someone. It may not 'solve' your problem but you may get a new perspective and feel your shoulders get lighter. Life is just a series of events, you are not really in control of these events. People may say you can control these through hard work, perseverance, work ethic etc etc, but the outcomes are also a result of the times.

Don't take success and failure too seriously. The guy wrote a graphic novel:

Read the article. Has nothing much to do with politics. An design student (MDes)  took his own life after failing to get a job, while complaining of grades slump in latter half of 2nd  year.

That he drew a graphic novel etc is just an aside. I asked to myself

What do you want to prove so much for?

I work hard

Isn't talent is hardwork or am I wrong.


Then what went so wrong

Why not it showed result

None of the commenters claiming this violence was not casteist because the accused was sc/st provide any evidence for that claim. They even provide links that don't mention the caste of the accused as evidence for supporting their claim. I don't think I'm capable of explaining to them how the whole evidence business is supposed work.

No, we're not done, yet. One of them told me to google the last name of the accused to substantiate the claim that the accused was a tribal. Here's my response to the deleted comment:

He mentioned how the growing rate of Muslim population was not a good sign and potentially alarming for Hindus.

He recalled and gave some examples of how in the past people of different religion have converted fellow Hindu people (into Christianity or Buddhism) by hook or crook and now was being done by Muslim people and someone (read RSS) was the correct organisation to keep these activities in check.

Now, I did not have any data to back up any further assertion I could have made regarding population statistics, so I decided to comeback at the argument later. 

I am presenting you the findings I came across. My inferences are at bottom.

NOTE:

* Values have been rounded of at certain places
* Some data has been calculated based on percentages of that census year
* Differences in totals exist because data for certain regions does not exist - I have no idea why.
* Data retrieved is only from 1951 because lot of people migrated between India and Pakistan in 1948 - so data before that considers the whole of British India.
* Before Independence, Arya Samaj and Bramho Samaj were considered as religions and later merged under Hindu only.

based on the data above, I calculated the individual percentages of all populations in all census years:

Looking at this data, I saw what I was probably expecting to see:

**NO KHATRA IN INDIA**

Inferences:

* Percentage wise, Hindu population looks on a steady decline but very small margin.
* Numerically, Hindu population is still growing by at least 3 times the growth of Muslim population.
* The rise in number of people who decline to specify their religion is far far more than any other religion.
* Social reasons like female foeticide, increasing costs of living, late marriages, easy access to contraception and dream of a better life contribute to Hindu families being smaller and smaller each generation (applies to other religions too).
* Similarly social reasons like polygamy, refusal to contraceptive options, lower literacy and multiple/more kids per couple contribute to increasing population among the Muslims.

*Now, I don't know how this analysis would be perceived by you all. so I kept the adjective part empty, and thought maybe you could suggest one yourself.*

**TLDR: Analysis of census data to check whether Hindu population is declining in the country. Answer: No.**",cleanstart92,[R]eddiquette," Neither Hinduism nor Hindus are in danger. Only the vast number of pea-brained people were in danger of losing relevance. RSS, VHP, BJP, Bajrang Dal brought these disgruntled and dumb people together. It became successful due to their shared fear of losing control of the country and privileged position. Since the insecurity was among the cretins, Cretinism took over and it replaced Hinduism in the mind and soul of the Hindus.  Cretins would rule. Cretins would decide for others. Cretins would educate. Cretins would spread fear-mongering. Cretins would shout down every free voice. That is the core idea of Hindutva. Good work! I would like to add few points to your analysis.

All in all, it comes down to the economics. Poor families generally tend to have more children. They want extra pair of hands who could help the household. In contrast to this, if you see families with fewer children (one or maybe two) are financially better. They want to provide a better life to their children. This means putting them in better (read expensive) schools, investing in their well being and future etc.  And these families can only 'afford' to have one, maybe two children. Religion has nothing to do with population increase, but economics does.

&#x200B;

If you're interested to know more, there are many talks available on youtube by a swedish statistician, Hans Rosling. His talks generally give me a positive feeling about the world. Here's a link to one of his talks where he says that the world population will become stable at 11 billion and that the number of children below 15 years of age has already become at 2 billion and it would never change unless any catastrophe happens.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LyzBoHo5EI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LyzBoHo5EI) I quickly plotted your data. Thanks for sharing!

 [https://imgur.com/a/kpSSuFO](https://imgur.com/a/kpSSuFO) Conclusion : Neither Hindu nor Muslim, nor anyone else should have more kids. 

Use contraception people, ffs! [deleted] Religion has become pretty much irrelevant these days. A village uneducated hindu farmer will have little in common with my lifestyle and values compared to a chinese urban professional in my same line of work with similar education and salary. I might be diverging a bit here but this data nails the lie that Christian missionaries are converting nation into a Christian nation.. Percentage of Christian population has never crossed 3 per cent at any point post-independence.

This either means missionaries are not really good at their job or sanghi propaganda is just that.. a propaganda. Anyway Hindustan is not under threat from missionaries. Anyone bigot who says muslims have too many children should be shown this data.


https://m.timesofindia.com/india/fertility-rate-below-replacement-level-for-all-but-hindus-muslims/articleshow/62465588.cms

The fertility rate for hindus was 2.59 in, 2005 and 2.13 in 2015. For Muslims it was 3.4 in 2005 and 2.61 in 2015. Basically muslims are at the same fertility rate as hindus were 10 years ago.

So when it was 2.59 for hindus in 2005 nothing was wrong. But when it's 2.61 for Muslims 10 years later, muslims have too many children according to bigots.

Also hindus tfr is 2.59 and Christians is 2.34. Except muslims, hindus have a higher tfr than every other religion. Bigots will take hindus fertility rate as the baseline even though it's higher than replacement levels

And there is also this North South divide. Muslims from south have lower fertility rate than hindus from north.

And also polygamy doesn't affect fertility rate because the number of men are more than women. Hmm.. Maybe you would need to factor in that under Hindus many are really agnostic and Arya Samaj, Brahmo Samaj, Anand Marga and sects/offshoots don't really count as Hindu. Also the total fertility rate amongst Hindus would be at much lower rates than in Muslims! Which brings us to ""dara hua Hindu""!

One dharavi slum tour package from a travel agency called Reality Tours and Travels had the best ratings on TripAdvisor India website. ""Vice"" doing their name proud. Clickbait masterclass. Poverty porn :( Be a little self aware white people. # Poor People Hungry People

Oye amrikan idhaar aa, tujhe photography chahiye na? poor people ? hungry people? Only 50 Rupees Why the fuck cant the govt just bulldoze these slums and building public housing for these people. Give it to them for free. THe land is probably so valuable it still would't cost anything, sell the remaining land to developers. It's called poverty tourism, they do it a lot in African countries as well. When your life in Europe becomes so luxurious and perfect that you start craving for poverty, chaos, noise and non robotic human emotions for a change.

But then you get bored of this chaos called Dharavi and realize that life is essentially meaningless and there is nothing new to experience.

So you return back to your stable robotic life in Europe with periodic vacations to cultural chutiyapa that exists in India When will the statue beat Taj Mahal. Poor people, hungry people.", NOTA-Voter shaurcasm ctownlife vivzkestrel crackerdestroyer The_ZMD trolloindos santa326 prshnt
[AskIndia][Serious] Is it worth attempting immigration to Canada/ Australia for 1.6lpm-ers in India?,53,c4ilk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c4ilk5/askindiaserious_is_it_worth_attempting/,116,1561381878.0,"Title. 

From what I understand based on armchair research: 
Motivation to immigrate: better future life for children in terms of clean water, air, education
Cons (probable): not the same standard of living as is currently?, slower professional growth, racism? 

Experienced immigrants/ those who are in similar shoes, please share your thoughts",aashish2137,[R]eddiquette," NRI with a fairly neutral opinion here.

Some Cons that aren't always shared:
Expect a much quieter social life, a cultural gap in addition to a generational gap with your children, a reduced sense of self-identity, a lower standard of living and immense adjustment stress. 

Ofcourse you'll have more money after immigrating but it won't feel as luxurious as it sounds when one multiples dollars into rupees. If you enjoy a more self-involved lifestyle, it'll be easier to adjust. If you'd like, I'd be happy to chat over dm and answer more specific questions. I my opinion if you are looking for material happiness then immigrating is not a bad idea. What I mean by that? With just two months of salary in Canada you can actually afford a nice 60 inch LED TV, a sound bar and a nice couch. One year into job you can afford a muscle car like Camaro or Mustang (with loan ofcourse). You can also meet Indians and make new Indian friends by going to temples or other Indian group meeting that you look up on Facebook. 

But if you are a kind of guy who likes to be around family and friends, don't really care what car you are driving and the kind of house you are staying in then Canada might be boring. All in all I would say getting Luxury is easier in Canada/Australia than in India. But getting Family and friends is easier in India. And as someone already mentioned if you have Kids then the equation is entirely different. I migrated to Canada in 2017 - it's been a great experience for me so far, but it boils down to effort, luck and circumstances. 

My standard of life by local comparisons is definitely lower than my peers - a dollar goes a lot less than a rupee would in India. Having said that, though - I've never been a particularly money obsessed person. Give me a cot, 3 square meals and a roof over my head and I'm good, but I do appreciate that the quality of stuff I get here is substantially better for the amount I pay for it compared to India. 

Professional growth - I'd argue it's the opposite due to my specific circumstances. Employers let you Work from Home, some others (like mine) have an 'education allowance' to allow you to upskill on the company's dime, I get plenty of days off (5 day work week, statutory holidays means no work - it's actually straight up criminal and I get Christmas week (till New Year's off). Nobody questions/interrogates you if you want to take a few days off. I actually changed my role within the company because my own manager said I'd be a right fit for it and he helped me get the job. I love my coworkers and we get along very well. 

Racism - Can't speak for Australia but in Canada, it's mostly been low-key and barely noticeable if not non-existent (largely owing to the significant number of Indians already in Canada), outside of some clearly mentally ill people (the city of Toronto does a shitty job of looking after the mentally ill homeless people, especially now that it's summer and they're all around the city). 

I've already accepted the fact that neither side will truly accept me for what I am (Third Culture Kid, so not really fully Indian and not really super westernized, either) so the idea of a generational gap is already a forgone conclusion. 

Happy to answer any questions if folks are interested in learning more about the process or are generally just weighing options and want to know more about life in Canada - I also happen to run a landing group for new immigrants basically to help them with a social support structure as they get their sea legs after they land. It could be. 

You need to identify what pay in Canada/Australia is equivalent to the 1.6 lpm.  Then identify jobs that pay that in respective countries and then identify cities that would make your chances of achieving that better. 

For factors such as free/subsidized medical, education and to some extent a higher standard of living (to each his own). It is definitely worth doing it. 

Happy to answer in private too. Especially about Australia. Or even New Zealand. So this might be a one off case but even younger Indian who are in their 20s or 30s can experience a massive culture shock.

Eg 1 : My friend and his two kids stayed in Boston. So Indians are known as a race who hits their kid to discipline them (also  known as child abuse ). So his kid's friends and teachers had taught the kid that they can call the police if their parents hit them. 

His kids were the worst pieces of unruly shit I have ever laid my eyes upon. He and his wife literally went mad trying to discipline them. The kids used to threaten to call the police or complain to teacher if they hit them. So the parents were quite shocked and unable to control their kids. They eventually moved back to India.

Eg 2: if you are a conservative Indian, be prepared for your kids teenage years. They will date other people, probably indulge in casual sex, have secret alcohol parties. Dress skimpily and post tons of those pics on fb, Instagram etc. This is just pretty much inevitable and pretty common in the west. 

I have a modern friend who is well travelled, well read, rich and comfortable but just can't sleep because his teenage daughter was dating someone and loved partying and dancing. They can compromise on many things but kid's possible promiscuity is something they can't adjust to. 

This was few observations from a a decade ago or so. Depends on your line of work too, I guess. A 1.6 LPM friend of mine moved to Canada for MBA (he was in IT here before that) and struggled to find a job in business/management. So switched to IT after doing his MBA since he saw better job prospects here. Within Canada there are a lot of variations as well. Vancouver and Toronto metro areas are expensive and you will definitely have to sacrifice on some of your comforts. Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Winnipeg and Halifax are far more affordable. Halifax is a booming city now with a growing tech industry and pretty affordable. Canada isn‚Äôt as high paying as the US. But it‚Äôs offset by free healthcare, education & the environment there. It‚Äôs a massive pain to adjust to any new country. 

Even if you find a job that pays 100k CAD a year, the adjustments you need to make in terms of social settings will stay the same. 

But, depending on where in Canada you are for example GTA - you‚Äôll find a robust Indian community. Canadians are in general more welcoming of immigrants vs other countries in the current scenario. 

Australia is just way too racist for my personal taste. They‚Äôve a very rigid set of thinking & have an intellectual superiority complex in the work place & there is a Trump like PM in Australia now. Absolutely. I was a 1.6lpm before leaving. This was 2 years ago. It was totally worth it. I'd do it knowing what I know now. [deleted] 1$=17 INR in terms of purchasing power.

Please help.

I've never had any problems with pills before. I used to take them without any thought until one night I took one and felt it was stuck inside. The entire night was scary, and the next morning I went to the clinic, only to be told that it was due to hyperacidity or something, that if the pill was actually stuck I could started coughing and so on. However, I am on meds right now because of some stomach issues, and the thing is I am super anxious about taking pills now. Like, I put one in my tongue and my heart immediately runs amok. I know this is a little embarassing and some people around me don't seem to get it. But I just feel so sad and let down by my self that I want to cry. I am just scared that the pill might wind up in the wrong place and kill me or something. I'd greatly appreciate your help.",zeusdreaming,[R]eddiquette," I also have a fear of taking pills. This is what I do. Chew some food, keep the pill in your mouth and swallow the pill with your food and drink water as you‚Äôre swallowing. You will hardly notice you are swallowing a pill Take it like kids have it..

1) find a spoon
2) find a lock ( godrej Wala)
3) take a piece of paper and keep the pill In it / fold the paper
4) crush the pill with the lock
5) pour the contents in the spoon and put some water in it.
6)close your eyes and  with the speed of light eat the contents / follow with a glass of water
5) open your eyes 

Repeat for the next pill . If it winds up in the wrong place, you'll almost immediately cough it out. Like how when rice sometimes ends up in the wrong place and you immediately start coughing while eating.

Make sure you swallow the pills with lot of water to make life easier. All pills dissolve upon coming in contact with fluids. Once it is inside it can not get stuck. Try drinking water first. It helps if you take the medicine  near a sink. Gulp like 1 full glass of water. Maybe this will help

Just keep the pill on your tongue and keep chugging water. If it's such an issue than just man up and chew it like food. If it's slowly developing into a phobia a bad taste in the mouth is a very small price My dogs (like most others) won't take a pill until it's wrapped up in something nice. You should try that, it should work on humans too. You'll know there's a pill in it obviously, but I think it'll be easier. Don't see, swallowing a tablet is hard. Just have some water before swallowing a tab and put inside ur mouth and just swallow it. Have little more water after having ur tab. it will easily go inside.

They do not know how to maintain a distance. I travel in metro daily even when the metro is half empty they stand too close. I literally want to punch them in fthe fucking face. You are lucky, once i was travelling by sleeper to delhi. I was in the upper berth. woke up midnight to find someone sleeping next to me (i am a deep sleeper). I woke him up and he was like ""Thoda adjust kar lo"". WTF?

Always travel in AC since then. Indians and transport generally don't mix. Like we tend to lose control as soon as you put us near a plane, train or car.

When my flight landed today in the morning, some uncle got up while the plane was still on the runway. And then he just stood there until the plane stopped.

When they were boarding the flight, people literally jostled to get ahead in the line. I'm like idiots, your seats are fixed. The plane won't leave without you, nor will someone else take your seat. Why the fuck are you in a hurry to simply sit in the plane? Should've kicked him and acted as if you were doing it in your sleep. [deleted] I used to travel often from Bangalore to Chennai and Bangalore to other parts of TN.

Reserved compartments are fucking jammed. Once you sit in your seats you can't move. And women give me dirty looks that I am sitting without offering them a seat. And don't forget women with tiny babies, sandwiched between 3 men or 4 women and 3 adolescents. Now I have feel guilty for having the good sense to reserve seat by paying extra money and advance planning and sitting (though uncomfortably).

And don't forget the stench and the fans not working. And worse of it all, now they have reduced the leg space and added few more rows of seats. I am fucking sitting with my kness touching the front seat.

For Chennai, I take the ac compartments as much as possible. But for the other places there is no option..

Fuck this shit. why don't you exchange your seat? It's the Indian mentality dude, ""thoda adjust kariyo"" is universal no matter where you are in India. Trains, buses, autos, queues, the list goes on and on with people not having the least idea of what personal space actually feels like. As someone who used to travel a lot and very routinely had to give up my lower berth to some older person coz it's sanskari... You have my deepest sympathies. I mean, come on, I wanted a lower berth, I got alloted one coz I had the presence of mind to plan my journey and book my ticket earlier but I have to give it up coz some fat lazy uncle doesn't want to climb the ladder. I eventually resorted to fake sleeping to avoid these type of situations.

But I do have a bit of information for you, irctc allocates berths based on availability, that's what happened in your case. Even though you stated your preference, it has to be available to be alloted to you. Maybe that's why you didn't get the upper berth. Good luck with your travels broüëç. Had almost the same experience. 

I was in side lower and this uncle with paan stained lips comes and sits at the end. I was not sleeping but about to. Starts talking loudly and playing loud videos on his phone. Including kaafi pro modi propaganda stuff. Bloody nightmare. 

This was in AC. 

Everyone around were quiet, it was just this code error of God who went on and on. 

I don't like confrontations, so I gave him a death stare (he looked at me like tum Kya karoge) pulled out my headphones, and plugged in it and maximised the volume so it drowned his voice. 

Did not expect it to work but he left in a minute. In before another post complaining how people are sleeping beyond 6 AM and denying them access to their seat on the lower berth.

[Rant] Having kids due to parental pressure in the Indian context,116,c12r34,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c12r34/rant_having_kids_due_to_parental_pressure_in_the/,113,1560665253.0,"I have seen too many of my friends regretting having kids. They and their partners were not ready and they say they were pressurized by their parents and other sections of the society to have kids.  The constant nagging of parents did the trick and they had kids. And here comes the clincher, they also they wanted to prove to certain sections of the society they are not impotent. Now they are struggling to pay their bills with the additional expenses that comes with having children because they haven't considered these things when they decided to have kids.

There are people who plan and have kids when they are ready and they are able to give the kid a good life and this post is not directed towards them.If you are ready and want to have kids and have the means to provide for them, go ahead. If you are not ready, you will only set yourself up for a life of frustration. Its not fair to the kids too. Don't bow to parental or peer pressure.  If you have the urge to prove that you are not impotent so bad , get your sperm or womb tested and get the doctor's certificate and place it at your living room wall or office space so you can show people this if you want to prove to them that you are not having kids because of choice. 

If you don't care about these things, just have kids when you are ready. Its also perfectly fine to not have kids too if that's what you want. There are too people in our country and it will be good we don't bring unwanted kids into this world.

End of Rant.",gellend,[R]eddiquette," It doesn't stop even if you have one. I have a single child by choice. People continue to tell me I'm selfish, my kid will be spoilt, will be lonely, etc.. I once got so frustrated with constant advice I ended up telling an aunty that another kid will reduce the sexy time between me n husband and I haven't heard from her since. I even tried telling people we are trying but I'm not getting pregnant and then they give me list of doctors names. It's nobody's business but the problem is we are brainwashed to respect elders so can't shout at them. Being old doesn't make anyone nice or wise, nosy young people grow up to be nosy old ones. In India, you have to get married to prove that you are not gay and then have babies to prove that you are not impotent. That's the sad reality here. I will never understand the impact of parental pressure, because my parents have passed away. But it still doesn‚Äôt make sense how parents can force a couple to procreate. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre coming into the bedroom and keeping an eye on the activities.

Just continue to use birth control and tell them you‚Äôre trying. There is also the stupid mentality of Indian men, my cousin brother who was not at all close to me once said while getting drunk before marriage that ""You have to get a child within the first year, parents will be happy, wife will get busy, as soon as she gets pregnant she will leave to her home and I'll be free as before"" My jaw dropped at the perspective he has towards women. Also everyone in my family thought he was humble and respectful towards EVERYONE. Earns around 80K pm. 

 These are the people you wish you could avoid talking serious things.

He had a child by the time of their first marriage anniversary. Stand your ground, people. A lot of us can barely save for ourselves; we don‚Äôt need 18+ years of additional hemorrhaging costs. Heard all the nonsense arguments. One semi legit argument I hear is that a kid will give you happiness that you didnt know you could experience.

Well, so can LSD! Or climbing Mt Everest. I am perfectly OK missing out on that delirious happiness. This is such a relatable post.  When I married my husband, we'd both decided that kids weren't for us.  Married over 5 years now and still child-free by choice.  Thankfully living away from India takes a lot of the pressure off.  I feel that a lot of the compulsion comes not directly from how our parents/family feel but what society will think, ie. what will they say, see how all the other couples who got married at the same time have kids blah blah blah. We've been guilt-tripped like crazy by our parents but standing firm and knowing what you want (or in this case, don't want) really helps.  Plus it's really important to have a supportive partner who will also stand up to the bullies.  At the end of the day, it's no body else's business but your own. >If you have the urge to prove that you are not impotent so bad , get your sperm or womb tested and get the doctor's certificate and place it at your living room wall or office space so you can show people this if you want to prove to them that you are not having kids because of choice. 

Lmao I‚Äôm a parent and I can assure you - whoever tells you to have another kid have nothing else to do. Having a child takes a long time and you will need to make the child has good social exposure and skills. We are already overpopulated so we should have fewer kids. The cost of living has gone up exponentially in the past few decades and with zero monetary support it is suicidal to have more children. These fuckers are already talking/suggesting a second one, so much so that even the financial planner asks me if we should include the MFs from the perspective of sister/brother education/marriage of the first one.

 My wife and I laugh it out and ignore these hints and/or suggestions. Ek hi sambhal nahi Raha yaha. Kaun marane jayega fir se. Well rounded post. 

Many, If not most Indians are like zombies. They think very little about such things. 

Some are not aware that, children, among other things, are a personal choice that we can and must make on our own. 

I have seen people having kids for reasons like - 

1. Partner is not interested in them anymore. So they decided to have a kid to save the marriage. Or a second kid to increase ""happiness"" in marriage. 

2. ""What will I do when I grow old. I need someone to take care of me."" - the money that they can save by not having a kid, is more than sufficient to have them in a very good adult home.

> At 3pm on August 13 2004, Akku Yadav was lynched by a mob of around 200 women from Kasturba Nagar. It took them 15 minutes to hack to death the man they say raped them with impunity for more than a decade. Chilli powder was thrown in his face and stones hurled. As he flailed and fought, one of his alleged victims hacked off his penis with a vegetable knife. A further 70 stab wounds were left on his body. The incident was made all the more extraordinary by its setting. Yadav was murdered not in the dark alleys of the slum, but on the shiny white marble floor of Nagpur district court.

> Laughed at and abused by the police when they reported being raped by Yadav, the women took the law into their own hands. A local thug, Yadav and his gang had terrorised the 300 families of Kasturba Nagar for more than a decade, barging into homes demanding money, shouting threats and abuse.

> Residents say he murdered at least three neighbours and dumped their bodies on railway tracks. They had reported his crimes to the police dozens of times. Each time he was arrested, he was granted bail.

> He violated women to control men, ordering his henchmen to drag even girls as young as 12 to a nearby derelict building to be gang-raped.

>  Prominent among their supporters were 100 lawyers based in Nagpur who issued a statement saying the women should not be treated as the accused, but as the victims. 

> *One retired high court judge even congratulated the women. ""In the circumstances they underwent, they were left with no alternative but to finish Akku. The women repeatedly pleaded with the police for their security. But the police failed to protect them,"" said Justice Bhau Vahane.*

> On the day of Yadav's hearing, 200 women came to the court armed with vegetable knives and chilli powder. *As he walked in, Yadav spotted one of the women he had raped. He called her a prostitute and threatened to repeat the crime against her. The police laughed. She took off her sandal and began to hit him, shouting, ""We can't both live on this Earth together. It's you or me.""*

Justice delayed is justice denied. When politicians cannot rely on the stupidity of the common indian, we will start walking on the path of true reform. This is failure of our justice system, if people start feeling that system will do nothing and it this is the only way to deliver justice. It will normalise the mob lynching and it will be worst. 

And god knows when mob start doing it for wrong reasons. Recent mob lynching was the result of such thinkings, we need strong reforms. Damn.. News like this kaleje ko thandak deta hain The incident was win win scenario. Fucking amazing. It's a shitty world we live in.

[Serious} I have irreparably damaged my life. I dont know If I can still have a career,104,c610za,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c610za/serious_i_have_irreparably_damaged_my_life_i_dont/,48,1561638745.0,"Hi this is a throwaway account. Long post ahead

&#x200B;

I was an extremely lazy 25yo who has done some irreparable damage to his life. I scored well in 12th grade, but ended up getting admission in crap (reputation wise) college which had an excellent curriculum for economics. I wasnt even able to make anything of that too (my average is 53%). I have peers who made it to top European universities. I have no internships or any experience whatsoever. Having scored this low, i am ineligible to write exams for any Indian economics schools also.

&#x200B;

2 years ago, I passed out a few times and the Doctor diagnosed me with depression. Its so bad that I have even lost 60% of my hair. I was put on anti depressants and the course recently finished. I cant say it has helped, I have failed to turn my life around. I even rejected my psychologist's help, I'd lie to them about how I'm following what they're doing. I have since stopped going. I'm 100% still depressed only not I'm even more lonely. Forget friends, the acquaintances that used to be in my life have moved on too. I mostly just sit at home and leech off my parents. I cant fucking take it anymore. I used to be very choosy regarding what jobs to apply to and what to study etc but ive given up now. I'll do any fucking thing. Anything until my life is not on this track anymore.  I literally have absolutely nothing to do all day.

&#x200B;

Having done some reflection, not only do I 100% deserve this. I think I actually deserve a lot worse. Or maybe it is just me still not fully understanding the impact of the damage I have done to my life.

&#x200B;

Heres what I was hoping you could help with

&#x200B;

\> what internships should I even apply for? being a 25yo with no experience is already a big no for employers.  

&#x200B;

\>lets say i do get selected for interview, how do i even bring up the topic of mental health to explain all these lost years?",whitehat_throwaway,[R]eddiquette," Bro, you will need to first fix your self, start going out for small walks, go see some new thing, visit a zoo or a museum. this will help you start getting a new perspective on things. I know depression is bad and talking about it is even harder, I also did the same thing as you and avoided my doctors. It was something I will never recommend. I was on the verge of leaving this world when I decided to listen to my therapist one last time, and that I needed to see a few things before I go. I went to parks, museums, shopping malls, talked to street vendors, beggers, random people. My justification was that if I interacted with people it will at least help me end it all with satisfaction that I have seen it all. Well, that backfired and I started to see the world from a different perspective.

Look, you are 25 you have a lot of time with you, but you don't need to think in a conventional manner. Don't pressure your self to think an internship is what makes the carrier you want. In life the path you take is never paved for you, it is built by you and the direction it takes you will depend on many factors out of your control, you can only guide the path.  

Start going out, meet new people(*one interaction is enough, you don't need to make them your BFF*), pick an area you like learn about it, enhance your knowledge. Go out an give interviews(*Profile does not matter, you only need to get your self a 9-5 job to keep your mind busy*). Dont bring up your mental health with your employer, you are under no legal obligation to let them know. remember that the world does not care what percentage you got in your 12th or your college, your carrier is defined by you and your willingness to move up the ladder. Hey, I'm in a similar but a little better situation in my life. School topper, best university in the city, had huge dreams, was too choosy with jobs and post graduation courses. Ended up with a very basic job which pays bills.

A year back, I went for my college convocation. Everyone pestered me about where I'm working, what I'm doing now. When I told them, they gave me a I'm sorry look. Reached home and cried for 2 hours to my family. Till then, I had kept everything within myself. Like you, I had lost so much hair due to stress.

My mom told me not to compare myself with my peers. She said don't even talk to them if it makes you feel shitty. I started fixing my sleep timings and diet. Got myself a buzz cut. Fixed my hair fall. Set myself a 2020 career goal. I'm working towards it now. 2018 was one of the worst years for me personally and professionally. One open conversation with my parents and brother was all I needed to get my confidence and motivation back.

Just set a goal and dream big. I tell myself everyday,  ""I will not be an average person . I can do much better."" I don't live in India so I can't really offer any solid advice as to how to start a career or find a job but I do think you should start small. take care, exercise, eat right...

improve yourself to a point where you can be happy with yourself. Try not to compare your situation to your peers, it won't help.

If you don't like you, how do you expect anyone else to? First of all you need to realize that you are not alone in your battle. It sounds cliched but it helps a lot when you accept that a lot of people have gone through this and have come out on the other end victorious.  
Focus on small changes. This way you slowly improve and start taking better decisions. You won't get a job out of nowhere and that's fine. Take some time to decide what your end goal is?  
  

Do you want to code? Maybe you can become an excellent data scientist given your background in economics (I am assuming your math skills would be great)  
Instead of just lying around in your bed all day. Start with 20 minutes of studying daily. Just 20. Then increase the time you spend on studying. The power of compounding is amazing. If you just spend a few hours studying everyday you will be somewhere else a year from now instead of being stuck in the same rut if you don't do anything about it.  
Goodluck! I don't think I've seen the world enough to give you advice, but if you are trying to get into a good job, why not go for state government jobs. What I feel is that they really do not care about your university, grades or work experience. You have to do well in their examination and interview. Of course the competition will be high, and you have to work hard. OP, you need to know this...
Your academic qualifications or your job doesnt define you..
I know this sounds like every other cliche you've heard so many times. But it is true.

Few years down the line.. With something or someone in your life you will actually be able to laugh at this situation.

Every setback you've had.. Every mistake you've made.. Has lead you to this.. An opportunity to prove yourself.. To find a new path for you.

Few practical points..

1. You need to get your mind off this issue for a while. Do anything that suits you.. Go out.. Or not.. Stay indoors.. and talk to people.. Any1... Even us.. Redditors who know nothing about you personaly.. But wont judge..

2. Always reinforce the thought that whatever happens.. You and your life are the actual endpoints.. Not your qualification or your career..if you arent here, what good is that job or degree..

3. Think of alternate options in life.. Not all degree holders get a job... Not all job holders prosper.. Find stuff that you like to do.. It sounds like a cliche that love what you do.. But i can say from personal experience that if u love what u do.. It doesn't matter if that was your 3rd or 4th option in life..


Above all.. Never give in to crazy thoughts about self harm or punishment. Nothing matters in the end if you yourself are gone. One day at a time. You will get there. And do not be hard on your self. You don't deserve worse things that what has already happened to you. 

I read some where, 'Be kind to yourself, because if you are not, how can you expect others to be.' 

Wish you luck and like the master said,""It will pass!"". Honestly u need to take counseling seriously. It will help you find yourself. I have friends who have gone through huge shit and counseling has helped them. I was kind off the same except, at 23 without a degree or job. Had wasted 5 years in an engineering college. And when I say wasted I really did waste them coz I did not do anything, did not fully debit myself to fun or study, so I just really just fucked up. Parents were disappointed but still they were helpful. I joined a distance learning degree course, and on the other hand prepared for a low level govt. Job  which I luckily got in the first try at the age of 25, completed bachelor of arts in sociology. And now just preparing for CGL at the moment. Have been called for DV stage for cgl 17, but I am the tail end of the cutoff so, may not get a job at all. But  I am preparing and hoping to make it in CGL 2018 at least. Also if I don't make it it's not the end of the world. 
Just don't give up on yourself. 25 is still young. Persevere. That's what matters. In the end everything comes down to perseverance. The longer you persevere the better the outcome will be. [deleted] U need not worry that U dont do till 25 .
I know many guys who are close to me , started their life at 25/26/27 even 29 .
They too completed or left incomplete their studies with multiple attempts .
But , they didn't embrace nervousness as much U did .
Go for any job which comes in your way at whatever salary they may offer U .
Be sincere with your engagement & U will turn yourself in 3 years .
Go ahead , mix with new colleagues or friends , work hard & be an achiever .", subvolatile _Hoidd_ Magus55x CodeKnight11 Whomping_willow_ neo45215 yal_sik rennie20 dbodh None Vinnikool
'He Made Me Hate Myself': My Story of Being Bullied By a Casteist Teacher,73,cbdn67,https://livewire.thewire.in/personal/he-made-me-hate-myself-my-story-of-being-bullied-by-a-casteist-teacher/amp/,17,1562772615.0,,pazhampori,[R]eddiquette," Indians are really racist and what not.

As a person from minority (not Muslim), I have had fare share of bullying and discrimination. Once a teacher suspected that I was doing something mischievous, instead asking me to clarify, he made remark like: ""abhi to 12 nahi baje hai""; whole class started laughing, and I was really embarrassed. I used to be a shy kid and I didn't deserve it at all. Rather than taking it silently, I immediately left classroom without his permission and went straight to the principal, told him everything, he listened and was shocked that a teacher can say this. He told me to go back to classroom and sent a peon and asked him to bring the teacher in his office. Next day, teacher was extra polite and kind of sorry, but he never said sorry out loud. Although he did fail me in pre-boards, but who cares, I got my revenge.

Another time, I was going on a bicycle and fell down by hitting a pothole, I was like 12-13 years old. I hit my face on the road and busted lip and started bleeding, and you know what I heard from the crowd? ""Abhi to 12 bhi nahi baje"", that words and laugh still echoes in my ears to this day. How can you say something mean to some little kid who just fell down and bleeding? This is why we have a strong Atrocity Act Indians are the most racist people in the world. 

I've lived and worked around the world and the kind of comments I hear about other people and cultures from Indians is honestly shameful. 

We cry loudly about racism when other people do it but I've seen just how racist we are as a culture. 

Oh he's black so he must be a thief. She's a white woman and must be a slut. He's Chinese so can't be trusted. Oh he's Middle Eastern and must be a terrorist. All Christians hate Hindus. That Africa is a shit hole. And so on. 

And then there's the cultural superiority. Dumb arguments about how India's had everything before the West. And the worst part is when people who are in the developed world talk about how awesome India and Indian culture is but refuse to leave their Western comforts. 

And of course, every conversation with Modi supporters conflates Vatican with the US and Christianity with the Gandhi family.

Sometimes people are racist about dumb shit. My wife is white and much taller and I've heard desis crack rude jokes assuming I can't understand Hindi.

Even some of my really well educated successful friends in the US go on about Brahmin superiority make derogatory comments about ""beef eaters"" and how Americans are filthy for eating pigs. Teacher - ""If you study hard you will be a doctor, otherwise you will end up as a compounder"".

Meanwhile the compounder's kid listening to this just died on the inside. >I have lost empathy for myself. He made me hate myself. Maybe he is the reason why I never open up about my caste and that I have become ashamed of myself.

>He turned me into a casteist person ‚Äì the internalised oppression still hasn‚Äôt left my system.

>I still feel lower and not equal to the people I meet ‚Äì at a human level. When I was in 5th my teacher told whole class that Muslims worship pigs and Hindus cow.

What I regret the most is that I haven't reported piece of shit to principal. this country is truly one of the most racist and casteist countries in the world.         
the fact that the guy could get away with such behavior and nobody doing shit about it for so long should tell you all you need to know. and this is not an isolated incident. [removed]", WeekSpeller waahmudijiwaah brown_burrito morlock77 pazhampori Da_Big_Lebowski aadharshbalak None

Serious replies only, please.

Hi,

I live in a 1RK on the top floor of a resident house, there are only 2 1RKs on the top floor. A single bachelor girl is moving to 
one of the 1RKs. My house owner (who occupied 2 floors) is now living on an other city, so its going to be only 2 of us in the entire building most of the time.

I am mostly scared of the worst possible scenario like any false accusations or any problems and with the law leaning towards women, will the society blame me ? I am a bachelor as well, this makes the problem even more scarier. I don't know any thing about that girl, but I am just in paranoia.


I am mostly inclined towards staying, as there are no water problems here, that's the main reason she is moving in.

Am I putting myself in a vulnerable position staying there ? or should I just move out of it ?",afqradeon,[R]eddiquette," Chill the fuck out. You're paranoid. The likelihood of someone accusing you is miniscule. You are much more likely to encounter a serial murderer. Just keep to yourself and avoid talk unless necessary? 

I'm inclined to believe that the number of people who throw false accusations at random strangers is miniscule. While your concerns aren't exactly out of the blue or totally unfounded, you should know that the false accusation stuff is still very rare on an absolute scale. Also, why the fuck would a scammer try to falsely accuse a guy living in 1RK? (no offense but try to see my point) Then enjoy .....Why paranoid ? 

r/india parivaar mein itna khushkismat koi nahin hai . Keep kaam se kaam and never let her enter your house unless a thirf person is not there one whom u can trust I think that girl should move away.

[Opinion] The movie Talwar was definitely not a neutral as they claimed. Here are few things I gathered from the documentary about that crime.,88,c6wh5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c6wh5p/opinion_the_movie_talwar_was_definitely_not_a/,36,1561825718.0,"After watching Talwar Movie I was 100% convinced that Parents were not the killer.

After watching documentary on Hotstar - It appears that Parents were definitely shady.

- Why did brother of Dr Talwar started inquiring about all the legal aspects just when their daughter's body was found?

- Why did Talwar ask the Police to look into the terrace when they were on their way to immerse's their daughter's ashes? That is when they found the Dead body of servant.

- Why did Servant approach a human rights activist saying that his life was in danger, just few days/weeks before his murder?  This infuriates me the most about Talwar Movie. They just did not cover this aspect - likely because it was made with an agenda - though they claim to be neutral movie.

- The blood on they pillow case that they claim to be crucial evidence was extremely tiny particle of blood. In cases of murder there is much more blood.

- The servant was taken the Arushi's bedroom and asked to lie naked on her bed - while investigating the case - by the first team. They were definitely try to frame him.

That servant (Krishna) is now mentally unstable - unable to work for himself.

I highly recommend to watch that documentary as they are more neutral than the movie. 

Can someone add more points (which were against their narrative) that the movie missed?",ravindra_jadeja,[R]eddiquette," I watched the Talwar movie a couple of times and the HBO documentary also. Here are my observations:

The servant wasn't killed in their room, he was killed on the terrace. Had the police done a splatter anaylsis ( yes Dexter reference) a lot more could be found.

The angle of the servant being afraid a few days before might have been unrelated to the murder.

Why wasn't the khukri examined properly, it wasn't even taken away by police nor examined for blood. They simply said it was not sharp enough.


This could have been solved had the police done it duty properly.

Edit: Also learnt that nepali song from the movie Talvar, ""Ae resham....resham resham.... üéºüéµüéº"" I stopped thinking the movie was going to be unbiased as soon as the first policeman came into the picture, it was like they were trying to tell us that the first investigators were just plain stupid (which might be true in this case), but you don't have to make it that obvious and almost treat them like comic relief Link to the Documentary? man, this documentary revealed so many things. I believe the parents might be involved.

And that lady who said she met hempal, might just want to get some attention. So this is what you do when no indian player gets injured during fielding will definitely check the docu out! I just have 1 question. What motives did the parents/servents have to kill aarushi? 

Why was she the victim at all? She didnt seem to be involved in anything. I live in sec 25 jalvayu vihar noida. Not a close neighbor but a part of society. I have been part of this conversation for nearly 11 years. 
Let me out this out movie you watched is closest to the truth you ever will be. Let me make this clear uncle and aunty never killed anyone and they are just another old couple now who have probably gone through something that we folks can't even imagine in our worst dreams. A plain reading of the second CBI chargesheet clearly shows that the parents were involved. Even though the chargesheet gave them a clean chit. Will check out the documentary, I watched the movie a few years back so don‚Äôt remember the details clearly. 

One thing-In all these years has the parents ever blamed anyone for the murder? I don‚Äôt remember the bits of the case. This case makes you question the competency of  the institutions including the judiciary and police in UP.", buddy_maga iiamcraimm igivequalityhugs cowChewing Mastermind1703 KeziaChristopher TheUnfaithfulUser vijju9 trifle_truffle Lizzy_Bnt joyezhath
"Rahul Gandhi to Quit as Congress President, Asks Party to Find Replacement: Reports",272,btlflr,https://thewire.in/politics/rahul-gandhi-congress-president-resignation-replacement,140,1558988712.0,,Ajaatshatru34,[R]eddiquette," Good for him(and his party). Why Gandhis don't run for CM candidate ?

Become CM of UP, Delhi ... show some good work and then congress should project them as PM candidate ?

The biggest mistake RaGa did was, not taking any significant responsibility in MMS government, by doing some good work in a ministry it would've been much easier for congress to project them as PM candidates. I believe the Congress is stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

One one hand, Rahul Gandhi should resign and hand over the leadership (given the abject performance 2 elections in a row). 

On the other hand, there are no viable leaders in the party with a national presence (or even a regional presence). Thus, Rahul‚Äôs resignation may lead to power struggles or very weak leadership which can cause the party to split and disintegrate. And if this happens, there will be no national level party left to challenge the BJP (for multiple election cycles to come, given that it takes a long time to get a party established at a national level; and with the BJP controlling the media, it will be nearly impossible for a new, or even existing, party to make itself known and heard). This helps the BJP much more than if Rahul stays on.


Damned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt. I only hope they elect someone competent and not rush to the sibling. What the INC should do is learn from other democracies. In the UK for instance they have elections with candidates which the party members vote on. 

Let the INC come up with a few candidates who share their vision for the party, let members vote on them. And not FPTP, use a better system like IRV so you get a leader that most of the party actually wants. 

At this point, the CWC saying they're open to radical changes but not to letting RaGa go is ludicrous. You can't demand accountability and responsibility from your state level leaders if you don't demand it from your national leadership. Sachin Pilot should replace him. I think, in the long run, this will help Rahul Gandhi's political career. He should just quit his party posts and tour the entire country for the next five years or so, and then make a comeback. He should take notes from Jagan Reddy. I do not have any hope left, INC is at a stage which Apple was after their failure with the Newton, the INC is going to require a fucking miracle to get them out of this fucking ridiculous situation they dug themselves in.

Wife with sufficient income cannot claim maintenance: Calcutta High Court,344,c0gec9,https://barandbench.com/wife-income-maintenance-calcutta-high-court/,38,1560519311.0,,_snorlax__,[R]eddiquette," >The Calcutta High Court recently ruled that a wife cannot claim maintenance under Section 36 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 if she has sufficient independent income to support herself.
As observed in the judgment rendered by Justice¬†Biswajit Basu,
‚ÄúThe object of Section 36 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 is to provide a temporary financial support pending any action under Chapter V or VI of the said Act to the wife who has no independent income sufficient to maintain herself.‚Äù
The case at hand concerned a matrimonial dispute wherein the husband had filed for divorce before an Additional District Court on the ground of cruelty. In this suit, the wife filed a claim for Rs. 50, 000 per month as alimony under Section 36 of the Special Marriage Act. The trial court, however, rejected her claim, although it awarded her Rs. 30, 000 as litigation expenses.
The wife challenged this rejection before the Calcutta High Court, contending that she is entitled to maintenance proportionate to that of her husband‚Äôs earnings. She submitted that her husband earned an annual income of about Rs. 75 lakhs per year. Further, she claimed that she earned about Rs. 48, 000 per month.
On an examination of salary records, however, the Court found that the wife had earned over Rs. 74,000 per month between December 2018 and March 2019. In view of the same, the Court noted that the wife had independent income to maintain herself.
‚ÄúThe present income of the wife/petitioner as it appears from her aforementioned salary certificates is not less than Rs. 74,000/- per month which is sufficient for her support particularly when she herself has assessed her requirement at Rs. 50,000/- in the application for alimony pendente lite.¬†‚Äú
Therefore, the High Court upheld the lower court‚Äôs decision to reject her claim for maintenance, ruling that,
‚ÄúThe learned trial Judge in the order impugned has considered the requirement of the wife/petitioner vis-√†-vis her income and is absolutely justified in refusing the prayer of the wife/petitioner for alimony pendente lite. The order impugned, therefore, does not call for any interference.‚Äú 75 lakhs per year....Guy must be so relieved with judgement.

Could've been on hook for 40lac every year. That's fair. Reduces my anxiety regarding marriage. So does men has to pay Alimony even after women have job? What happens if she refuse to find a job? And is it entirely men's fault if she is not capable(education wise or others) of finding job? 

It would be great if you someone can explain! Can someone explain why was alimony introduced? Also is there any conditions to receive alimony? Equality is a bitchüòú Just read the other day, not entirely sure which court, but I probably guess the Delhi High Court, ruled that wife's income does not decide the amount of maintenance that should be paid.

Let's discuss these manifestos!

",rahulthewall,[R]eddiquette," It is ironical that these manifestos are so optimistic and ideal and yet each Government since as far as I remember fails miserably. No doubt, improvements were made but the pacing is so slow compared to the humongous problems - both social and economical- that I feel hopeless whether I look at these parties. At this stage, I am just wishing that these Sanghis just go away. I don't want another social evil devouring this country. This brazen propaganda and shameful communalization must stop at all cost.  we have to wait years when well-being of our countryman is the first and last topic in any political debate. Congress:

>Congress promises to pass the Constitution (Amendment) Bill to provide for reservation of¬†33 per cent of seats¬†in the¬†Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies¬†in the first session of the 17th¬†Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha.¬†

BJP:

>Reservation for Women - BJP is committed to 33% reservation in parliament and state assemblies through a constitutional amendment.


They seem unanimous, yet the bill won't pass. Or will it? I'm a first time voter and honestly this is a lot to take in. I can't decide whom to vote for. So, how do I go about doing a SWOT analysis, so to speak, that might help me take an informed and unbiased decision as to who deserves my vote? I really don't want to hit the NOTA , I'd rather sit at home then.  
Edit : I'll read both manifestos properly and use my own faculty of reasoning and common sense to decide. Thanks for the input folks! Thank you for this quality post. I really like this apprenticeship point. Training of work force is seriously lacking in India, especially the trades like plumbers, electricians etc. [removed] Looks like the sangh got spooked by the congress manifesto, and the response was to hurriedly put a lot of big numbers together. 25 lakh crore investment for agriculture and 100 lakh crore in infrastrcture in 5 years, just to name two big items on the list.

This might be ok if not for the irony of the sangh asking congress where the money for their schemes will come from. Manifestos of other parties --

I know the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the DMK released their manifestos, but can't find anything on their website. No mention of any manifesto on Aam Aadmi Party, Janata Dal (Secular), YSR Congress, Shiv Sena or Bahujan Samaj Party websites. When no one implements what is written, what‚Äôs the point in discussing. How many past governments have fulfilled at least 70% of their manifesto? Am I being dumb or is there something to worry about Simultaneous Elections? Mods can we have this thread stickied? Maybe include discussions of manifestos of other major parties too?

Nana Patekar gets clean chit in Tanushree Dutta sexual harassment case due to 'lack of credible evidence',155,c0420b,https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/nana-patekar-gets-clean-chit-in-tanushree-dutta-sexual-harassment-case-due-to-lack-of-credible-evidence-6807181.html,56,1560450076.0,,DarkSoulMasterFrodo,[R]eddiquette," Wtf is a 'clean chit' if the court case is still on? Guys, keep in mind that the investigation is closed by the police and not the courts. The police is claiming that there is not enough evidence to investigate. The case will still go on:

> Dutta will continue to fight her case and challenge the closure report, as per a tweet by Times Now.



How blindly you trust the police's version is up to you. Very often the court can disagree with police's closure report and force them to reopen investigation. This is NOT a final verdict in the case.

___

Edit: Just as a reminder, some of you might remember the gruesome Ruchika Girhotra molestation case. In that case the police and then CBI filed a closure report. The guy was eventually convicted, after 19 years.

> The family of Ruchika Girhotra has moved a special CBI court today challenging the closure reports filed by the investigating agency. The report had given clean chit to accused SPS Rathore, Haryana's former Director General of Police

> https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ruchika-girhotra-case-family-moves-court-against-cbis-closure-report-498247

If you haven't heard of this case, read the Wiki article. The victims family was totally destroyed, It is incredibly upsetting an rage inducing:

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruchika_Girhotra_case I'm not taking anyone's side here but I feel that police/court has taken the right decision, if they don't have any evidence against him.

Seems like a gimmick for elections A simple question. Why was she dormant on this issue for so many years? Many people claim she did try to complain back then too but people didn't listen.

It's hard for me to believe that. Since Tanu was already a famed actress when this happened.

Without any sort of proof/evidence, you come back from the US and start accusing a revered actor of the film industry just like that, in my opinion, is unacceptable.

I've never ever witnessed a case such as this on Nana Patekar before this ever. It's just too hard for me to believe it to be true. I don't deny the possibility of this not happening but there's absolutely no proof of what she accuses him for.

For all the people who fell for what she said, these people are actors. It's in their nature to lie or exaggerate things without you noticing it.", subtopewds609 kash_if manchill shhhhhhhhhh cR3dd1t FactCheckPolice
Trichy man allegedly beaten to death for defending a woman being harassed,904,brnqpt,https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/trichy-man-allegedly-beaten-death-defending-woman-being-harassed-102192,89,1558554228.0,,Ajaatshatru34,[R]eddiquette," Absolutely disgusting! Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it to be a hero > ‚ÄúAbdullah was also inebriated and he died because he was pushed to the ground and sustained head injuries. It was not a big fight,"" he said. When asked whether the reason behind the brawl was that a woman was harassed, he responded, ‚ÄúIt was.

A person dies and not a big fight? He is not worthy of being a police officer. I would be upset even if the mob killed the guy who was harassing the girl because it should be handled by authorities. But, to become a country where the person doing the right thing is killed, is another level of sadness. Police saying a muslim guy drove an auto drunk? 

Come on. I dearly wish for a day when women of our nation could roam without being harassed in any manner whatsoever. It has been a nuisance and it just doesn't appear to end. Utterly disappointing. I wonder where our country is going.  It is painful to read such things [removed] This is India. Developing India. Why do we need to help someone? We should learn a lesson from these incident.

He was helping someone and beaten so at that time what other people were doing? oh! I see they were playing Gandhi's monkey rule don't see, don't listen and don't speak in the favor of truth.

WELCOME TO THE NEW INDIA!!! This is really really sad. I read such articles and I feel a bit depressed. What if it was me in that situation? Could I have made the effort to save that woman? Majority of the times the answer is no. What if it happens with my wife in my absence? I would want someone like him to save her. But would his effort be successful? What if it isn't?! What if it is?! I again think about the first question and the answer is yes, I will make the effort.

[R] Depressed but can't get proper help,38,cdjsr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdjsr1/r_depressed_but_cant_get_proper_help/,10,1563237759.0,"Hello /r/india,
I was recently diagnosed with depression following a horrible year (my pet cat of 12 years was run over, nana diagnosed with prostrate cancer, I found out I don't enjoy engineering 2 years in) which ended with me standing on the roof of my hostel. Fortunately a friend talked me down and kept me company until I saw a psychiatrist the next day. 

She prescribed me fluexotine(sp?) and suggested I regularly go to therapy. 
My friends also told my parents what happened, then my mom flew over ASAP and took care of me until my exams were over and then took me home. 

My problem is this: my parents don't think I need medication or therapy. They think I need ""laad pyaar"" and ""ghar ka khana"" to fix my off mood. They think medication will break my mind (""dimag kharab"") and that I can't just talk to strangers about this. But when I talk to my family, I they just tell me to think positive or that these things happen. 


I've been at home for 2 months now and my mood hasn't improved. I'm still thinking about the rooftop everyday and longingly eye the fan all the time. How do I convince my parents that mental illnesses are real, and to let me get proper help? They think antidepressants is like weed or alcohol or something. And that therapy is unnecessary because I have a loving family. 

I can do it behind their backs, but that feels like I will be breaking so much trust they put into me. So please don't suggest I sneak around.",hellodepresso,[R]eddiquette," Before you sit down again for a talk with Ur parents  do some research by getting informed on depression and your symptoms, include some credible sources like the National institute on Mental health  to add some weight to the conversation ..and finally to conclude,  tell them that you would need their support as it would be extremely difficult for you to get through this phase on your own ..Include the fact that you've tried to end your life before and that this has been  a recurring thought ever since .. Wow, I was in your place a couple years ago. 


I was put on Prozac/Flunil (fluoxetine) as well, and have been for the past couple years, after visiting the psychiatrist by myself because my fucking parents are too dumb to understand that mental illness is a real thing (when they in fact visibly suffer from one form of it).

Given that you're at home, I think the biggest thing you can do right now is try and see if you can move out of there. I forced myself to move out for a few months and lived by myself -- learning a whole lot about life in the process.

Anyway, I think your first priority should be to REGULARLY keep taking your Prozac capsules. Don't skip it, even for a day (assuming it's daily and not weekly dosage). Secondly, start journaling. And thirdly, try attending all your sessions, if possible.

Personally, I can tell you that Prozac changed my fucking life. That extra serotonin boost I got from it is literally the reason I turned my life around. 

Be sure to check out /r/prozac and watch this video from NYT on the subject -- https://youtu.be/qgCFQ5no2jg.

Finally, free feel to hit me up if you feel like talking. I've been there and I know how difficult it is. Cheers! 

P. S. Hope my writing is legible because I'm sleepy af. Go to therapy regularly. Take your meds everyday. Your parents might never understand but keep doing these 2 things. 
Do things that can improve your mood. Exercise REALLY helps. I know it's very hard to get yourself to do anything  but if you can manage to get out of bed and go to the gym, it'll really help you. Try to reach out to your friends. Being surrounded by laughter is very helpful. If you do drugs or drink regularly, try to cut down. 

I was depressed in college (I was on 20mg SSRIs for a year) and I stayed depressed until I graduated, moved back home, started working and settled into a routine. That's when I noticed an improvement in my mood. You need a lifestyle change man. You could even consider taking a semester off and go live elsewhere. Maybe with a cousin/sibling in a different city away from your parents. Maybe write about your problem to an online therapist like [this](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/) (couldn't find any Indian site, sorry) just like you wrote here, additionally asking their help to convince your parents about the need for face-to-face therapy and asking whether antidepressants are bad. Show their reply as a qualified professional to your parents. Don't do engineering if you don't want to. Find something you like. Sorry about your cat. Sorry about your grand father getting prostate cancer. It's sad but out of your control. Do what is in your control, support him and be there for him and your family. 

Feeling different by taking medication does not solve your problems.

EDIT: I really think what you need in life is a proper set of goals. You can see a doctor and ask him/her to talk to your parents and make them understand what you're going through. It might be better than you explaining it yourself because that'll be very tough for you, especially when you'll have to push hard for them to understand. start going out, walk in malls/locality/parks or get some exercise.  
Every day, consistent and preferably at the same time.    
Focus on tasks or stuff you like to do or learn and slowly build your way up.  

Medicines do help but they come with baggage as well.   
Eat them but work on your self, you are in charge and you always can improve no matter how hard; lifestyle changes is a necessary thing to do.    
And eat healthy, veggies and fruits. I am a cannabis advocate and support legalization. I know that this is a very serious issue and I do not wish to spam/troll. I just want to point out that a recent study linked legalization to a drop in suicide rates.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232164/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232164/)

It is not conclusive and more research is required. But that cannot happen without legalization in India. Hence [r/GanjaMarch](https://redditcommentsearch.com/r/GanjaMarch)

"Yes!! Kabir Singh is a horrible movie, but Thank God this one is just a movie.",32,c4ip83,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c4ip83/yes_kabir_singh_is_a_horrible_movie_but_thank_god/,51,1561382553.0,"TL:DR   In a civilized society, the role of entertainment is rather limited in the molding and shaping of a uncivilized citizen. So, the movie Kabir Singh isn't going to cause a surge of Kabir Singh's army across the badlands of UP&Bihar. 


Yes, I understand all the hate this movie is getting. But, movies don't define reality. GoT suddenly won't inspire beheading, and Breaking Bad won't turn a Chemistry teacher into a drug lord.

People are showing more concern towards a movie than they may have shown towards the real-barbarism in society. Just open up your local/state/newspaper, and read the horrible stories of rape/murder and whatnot. There are real stories in India, which are more tragic than watching a imaginary one on 70-mm screen. 

Additionally, Kabir Singh won't create more Kabir Singh in the society. It is the structure of the society, the law&order and the priorities of the society. The badlands of UP&Bihar are not the HBO's Westworld, created by a mad genius movie-maker making thousands of movies similar to Kabir Singh.",batmansayshello,[R]eddiquette," I saw a tweet yesterday about the movie and it explains very succinctly why that outrage exists. This girl stated, very aptly, that it's a big deal because the movie is triggering, to every woman who has gone through stuff like that in real life. I haven't seen the movie so I won't comment on that, but the trailer itself reminded me of all the times a man has stalked me in the name of love, told me he'd make it impossible for me to leave the house if I left him, told me he'd kill anyone else I dated, told me what to wear and what to do and gotten irrationally angry when I didn't listen. I'm not denying Shahid is a good actor, I'm not blaming him for choosing to play that role. I'm questioning the very existence of movie like that in a time like today where, as OP himself says, there's already enough shit as is. Also, everyone seems to be saying that art doesn't inspire things in reality, for reference, when the movie tere naam came out, I personally got harassed by a man who just would not give up because he thought he was so in love and so emotional, just like Salman in that movie. I can give you ten other examples of how much art affects real life in a place where people are just SO gullible. Got and breaking bad not inspiring beheadings and other stuff because we don't live in that world anymore, and those are bigger crimes than treating women like shit in the current society, sadly. Comparing GoT and Kabir Singh is not exactly an apples to apples comparison now, is it? Ofcourse people don't go beheading people and mounting heads on spikes because GoT is a fantasy series set in a fictional land. On the other hand, toxic masculinity is a real thing, in this country specifically. When a movie like this glorifies such behaviour, it reinforces pre existing notions prevalent is society today. To your point of viewing entertainment as just that, how many people in this country do you think are able to separate movies from reality? Have we really forgotten the protests people stage against movies that have a narrative against them? And the broad generalization of people showing more outrage against this movie than actual horrific events is just wrong. Maybe this movie won't create more Kabir Singhs. But it will normalise existing toxic behaviours and will reinforce existing ideas, which you cannot deny is absent in our society. I agree that movies don't shape citizens. But perhaps they act as agents of confirmation bias? Like you have some rotten thoughts within you and you see those thoughts projected on screen and it confirms your fantasy.

I haven't watched Arjun Reddy or Kabir Singh (and don't plan to). But I have seen Tamil movies where the guy never ceases stalking girl till she says yes to his advances. And in last few years there have been instances where guys have set girls on fire or slit their throats for rejecting their advances. 

Were they inspired those movies. I cannot say. But what if those movies confirmed their patriarchal thoughts and they decided to react violently because  girl didn't react according to script? That cannot be ruled out. #respekt
Finally one post about this movie which  tells people it's a movie. [removed] I'm not getting how people are just comparing this movie to GOT and Breaking Bad. Those are English shows ffs, few lacs of people watched them. This movie has been shown on 3k+ screen across India and it'll be on Indian TV channels too. Impact of this movie is direct and way too much then GOT or BB. [removed] Almost all stories have flawed characters (villains). The problem is, when the flawed characters are put on higher pedestal (as a strong undertone) and the viewers are made to mistake the character as viable option to be imitated. ""Viewer are made to"" is the part where filmmaker's intention is judged. I am not against portraying flawed characters, I am against glorifying flawed characters. For example, take two films from the same director - Satya & Sarkar. Satya did not glorify flawed character, it portrayed them. That was a good movie. Sarkar glorified flawed characters, it was not a good movie (from the craft's perspective, Sarkar 1 was a good movie too tho). Similarly, take Raman Raghav 2.0, hell of flawed characters - all of them.  None of them were glorified. Coming out of the movie, i reckon, none would be fantasizing to be like a Raman or a Raghav. If a movie makes masses feel disgusted about the flawed characteristics of a person it is a good movie, if it doesn't it's not a good movie. It's a depiction of character and  I don't know why are people getting so sentimental about it. 

I love watching Narcos but that doesn't mean I plan to start up my own drug empire like Escobar. Let's separate fiction from real life. Tere Naam and Arjun Reddy is also there. So, three. > In a civilized society, the role of entertainment is rather limited in the molding and shaping of a uncivilized citizen

It seems unnecessary that one police officer is dragging him across the road by the legs while the other is busy stomping at his chest and head repeatedly. 

And will someone please tell the Indian police force about the existence of handcuffs. Indian police officers must rank as some of the **the worst trained** officers in the world. 

8 of then couldn't take down a single man? fucking thumb-wrestling a guy with a sword?

**What a joke** People casually forget that this is Delhi. Delhi sikhs do not trust Delhi Police at all because well, 1984. There were many incidents reported, where police came in first, collected weapons from Sikh families and told them to lower their guard and then followed the mob attacks. They clearly were able to subdue him. Whatever happened to handcuffs. People supporting the police beating up the perps do not understand the seriousness of this issue. Once cop got that taste of power, it will be your turn for getting beaten with sticks, even though your offense may be minor, or you just happen to be in a crowded metro station.


D.P. should have handled it gracefully, instead they acted at the same level of the alleged perps, and that is the real issue! Also lack of training and professionalism, could have easily overpowered him with proper training. Lavde lag gaye thullo ke baad meinü§£ What an idiot. Not condoning Delhi Police, but this guy is lucky they did not shoot him. The father raised sword on In-duty police officer and son tried to ran over police men with their vehicle. Policemen asked son to get out of the vehicle which he refused after multiple attempts and hence got beaten up by the police. And poeple are blaming policemen for beating them both? I mean, when a 14 year old tries to run over people with vehicle and refusing authorities, what more can one do other than using force? And after all this happened, they came back in mobs and attacked police station??? I used to have huge respects for my Sikh brothers because of their high morals and values but this mob attack on police station is just atrocious in the least. It seems no one wanted to stop and think for a second about the situation and consequences. 

If a person raised a weapon on a police officer and got punished for it, are policemen at the fault? Imagined if this happened in any other country? Like U.S. or U.K. They'd be shot to dead already.

Be prepared.  

The first book I read as a child, after learning to read letters and words, was Ramayan. The book full of colourful paintings, written in easy Bengali, was a gift from my grandmother.

Today prime time was really good. So far I didn't see any news show making so good analysis on this topic. He even goes into details explaining how malnutrition and consumption of litchies at same time stops glucose production in body and could be possible reason for death of 100 kids.

FTFY Crux of the video :

‚Ä¢ Eating Lichi is not bad, would **not** have any negative impact on a healthy person ( adult or minor ).

‚Ä¢ Ways of prevention for the said disease are **known** and easily implementable.

‚Ä¢ Deaths occured due to **malnutrition** and lack of awareness. Efforts from the administration could've saved these kids from the unfortunate. Similar deaths have occured before in the same area, for same reasons before.



Ps. Lichi is my favourite fruit. Lichi juice is really good for vodka cocktails. wasn't there a studu that published its findings 2 years back ? It pointed to very simple solutions.

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(17)30035-9/fulltext

from the article.

> Our investigation suggests an outbreak of acute encephalopathy in Muzaffarpur associated with both hypoglycin A and MCPG toxicity. To prevent illness and reduce mortality in the region, **we recommended minimising litchi consumption, ensuring receipt of an evening meal and implementing rapid glucose correction for suspected illness.**  A comprehensive investigative approach in Muzaffarpur led to timely public health recommendations, underscoring the importance of using systematic methods in other unexplained illness outbreaks. What can be expected when one of the ministers is found sleeping during meetings and other is asking for cricket scores.

100 kids dying would be national emergency in any other decent country.

Maybe here too if this happened in Mumbai or Delhi For all the talk to being morally superior to other countries , people here sure don't  have a bit of empathy for poor people. Poor people are treated as something to avoid, a vermin in the periphery who, as soon as are out of sight are out of mind for good.

The sense of community here only is present in terms of boasting, issuing absurd restrictions and talking shit about other people.

I don't want to seems like someone who hates their own country, but I couldn't help feel angry and dejected , after seeing  the lack of respect people have for other life. And you have to be on another level of  apathy and selfishness to not care about children.

If the state of this country doesn't scare you , you are either extremely rich or extremely powerful. [deleted] BJP or Congress or any regional party is not doing jack-fucking-shit to help the people. Most of the mainstream media is also not questioning them. Sigh.

*Jinhe naaz hai hind par, wo kahan hain...?* Every time this happens, public starts beating their chest scolding govt. but can't keep themselves clean as Japani Encephalitis is primarily caused by lack of cleanliness. This is a country where PM is supposed to teach everyone to keep themselves and their surrounding clean, which is a pretty basic thing to understand. No one wants to realise their own mistakes. Ek hi toh dill h ravish ji....kitna jitoge It's so heartbreaking to see those parents who just lost their kid.

Coming to the main issue of malnutrition, I know it's easy to blame the politicians for not setting up the required infrastructure but I don't know how much of the existing schemes are being being implemented properly by the health care workers. Take for the example the nutrition supplies from the Anganwadi to pregnant mothers, many a times the the officer from the main supply store doesn't send the supplies to anganwadi or the Anganwadi worker herself would take home the supplies. 

So what is important is bringing accountability throughout the system and not just to the politicians. Bringing accountability in India has been a huge problem. For politicians, its the job of media to scrutinise them and not just be their lapdogs. Its a bit more difficult for the workers lower down the chain.

The lower level workers themselves are quite financially insecure themselves and are easily prone to corruption. One thing I can suggest is attaching a resident or junior doctor (preferably from P&SM) to these centres. Residents stay for a stipulated time in the city till they complete their course, so are less likely to be influenced by local factors. Also now the supply officers and Anganwadi workers would have someone hardworking above then which I hope would promote a honest working culture.

Of course this means that every district would need to have at least one government medical college and our healthcare spending would need to significantly increased.", yonige_fan undercutkid makdi-babua odiab berserkergandhi LifeWastedOnLiving None throawayman20 None tilismilis docvg

>India had informed about Counter Terrorism (CT) action it took yesterday against a training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Pakistan based on credible evidence that JeM intended to launch more attacks. Against this Counter Terrorism Action, Pakistan has responded this morning by using its Air Force to target military installations on the Indian side. Due to our high state of readiness and alertness, Pakistan‚Äôs attempts were foiled successfully.

>The Pakistan Air Force was detected and the Indian Air Force responded instantly. In that aerial engagement, one Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian Air Force. The Pakistani aircraft was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side. In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG 21. The pilot is missing in action. Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts.

* Pakistan resorted to indiscriminate firing on Feb. 26 and was befittingly retalitated.  Given the high level of preparedness Pak designs were foiled.  We are in a heightened state of alert, he (Army Maj. Gen Bahal) says. 
* Navy remains poised in all three dimensions to defeat Pakistan's provocations. 
* AVM Kapoor says piece of evidence is being presented about the aircraft being used by Pakistan based on electronic signature.  Pakistan media reports showing engine parts were not of MiG 21s, he says adding that it could be concluded that F-16s were used.

Every time you think he can't get any worse... I see a lot of misinformation claiming the 'serial number' was from  missiles sold to Taiwan. [Like this article.](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1920385/1-fact-checking-missile-shown-indian-generals-sold-taiwan/)

So here are some facts.

First of all, it is not a serial number. FA8675-05-C-0070 is the contract number between US Department of Defense and the manufacturer. All of these missiles were manufactured under this same contract, regardless of who it was sold to.

https://www.bidlink.net/defense_contract/FA867505C0070

http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/release/3/66635/pentagon-announces-‚Äúforgotten‚Äù-contracts-(feb-14).html-(feb-14).html This link shows sales of these missiles to many other clients under the same contract.

>Raytheon Co. Missile Systems, Tucson, Ariz., was awarded on 28 December 2005, a $50,739,270 firm fixed price contract modification to provide for 102 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile Air Vehicles under the foreign military sales program for the following countries: Czech Republic, Hungary, Jordan, Malaysia, and Canada. Total funds have been obligated. This work will be complete in July 2008. Headquarters Medium Range Missile Systems Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., is the contracting activity (FA8675-05-C-0070/P00016

Even Pakistan's purchases were made under the same contract number.

>Raytheon Co., Tucson, Ariz., is being awarded a $269,646,834 firm-fixed-price contract modification. This action is exercising an option to purchase 500 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) Air Vehicles (AAVs) Air Intercept Missile (AIM) - 120C-5 missiles and rehost. This effort supports foreign military sales to Pakistan 100%. At this time, total funds have been obligated. This work will be complete April 2011. Headquarters Medium Range Missile Systems Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., is the contracting activity (FA8675-05-C-0070/P00028).

Source: http://www.deagel.com/news/Pakistan-Purchases-500-AIM-120C5-Missiles_n000001061.aspx

Important detail is that it is a contract between US Department of Defense and the manufacturer of the missile. Not with any other countries.
 I just got a WhatsApp forward asking me to stockpile enough supplies for one month. What do these unkils get from rampant fearmongering?! All the people trying to prove whether its a wreckage of an Indian fighter or Pakistani fighter can please shut up coz am pretty sure none of us have the slightest idea of what we are talking about Remember Pakistan claimed they did not use any F-16s. So, please stop believing things you hear from Pakistan or their media too. And yes, our media also sucks. So with one of our hero Abhinandan coming back from Pakistan, our other hero Squadron leader siddharth vashisth who died in the helicopter crash is leaving us. His ceremonial rights are ongoing in chandigarh right now. Please lets all pray for this brave soul and thank him for his service.

When a person accuse someone of something ,it's the ideally the police's job to investigate the situation. The victim is not under an obligation to provide you the proof for anything.

Moral policing much? Kerala night shelter turns away 5 women students for watching film,303,buo3x8,https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/moral-policing-much-kerala-night-shelter-turns-away-5-women-students-watching-film-102568,69,1559214183.0,,Ajaatshatru34,[R]eddiquette," Just a question - Between Kerala, TN, Karnataka & AP which state is more conservative? Not in beef eating & stuff but in moral policing. I know that people in AP still wants dowry for their sons and these people can be categorised as the 'educated class'. Having lived in Kerala(Trivandum),  Tamilnadu (Chennai) and Karnataka (Bangalore) , in my personal experience, Bangalore has the least moral policing, Chennai the most, and Kerala is somewhat in between (note: this is a *relative* comparison, not an absolute one).

 But note that I've lived mostly in cities, and the rural parts of all these states have more m.p than their urban areas.

*caste based* and religion based discrimination is (relatively) lesser in Kerala, practically non-existent, at least in the cities, but trying to monitor/control other people's sexuality and make them conform to 'social standards' is very much alive in Kerala too, sadly enough. Is it the movie or the curfew timings ? Many shelters are locked down after a certain time. [removed] [removed] Caste based discrimination is preety less in kerala when compared to southern tamilnadu or karnataka-banglore.

Moral policing is preety similar everywhere in rural areas So now attacks on Kerala have started ? Good. Someone who can spend money for the luxury of watching a film doesn't deserve a spot in a night shelter when there's more deserving people. ""Moral policing"" is basically the tagline of Modi's entire premiership, backed by his hardline RSS bwoys and the worrying number of highly conservative middle-class Indians across the country.

> ‚ÄúAs I had earlier observed in Punjab villages, the Dalits did not wish to work on land with cultivating farmers primarily for social and political reasons. Working with farmers implied accepting their domination and power. By refusing to work on land, Dalits expressed their dissent against the traditional structure of patron-client ties. Even if it meant cycling to town for casual labour for no higher a wage or secure income, a Dalit did not like working on land.‚Äù

There was this guy named Mukesh Chabbra but now he's back and he did the casting for ""Leila"". Even Huma Qureshi thanked him on twitter.

Lasith Malinga was accused but yesterday he was being celebrated as the 2nd best bowler in SL. I don't see any developments in the case of Vairamuthu's case because he has too much power in TN.

Apart from these, whenever I search for those metoo cases, nothing new comes up. There were so many people who were accused and stepped down. Did we just forget them?

When an issue is raised, people keep talking about it all day, media creates breaking news, organises debates etc, and then something sensational happens, people talk about that. Those who sincerely keep fighting are suppressed by the *trending* happenings around. Something sensational needs to happen now to remind people of it again. [deleted] Probably because half the allegations were false. Not so hip anymore You can not have any such movement without law enforcement - the kind of ""development"", we need in India. It will fizzle out if you can not prosecute appropriately. [removed] [removed] AIB happened. It died because it was too unstructured and lacked political will. Some random people sharing in public isn't enough for a movement. Yea I feel bad that it seems to have died down too. In the very least, it was good that it did happen because it at least made people/abusers scared, and for a good reason- socially it can drastically affect their lives.  Look at what happened to Tanmay Bhatt - he was the lead of one of the most influential/powerful Comedic groups in the country, and now just a few days ago he posted a video saying how he's lost everything and is seriously batting depression.  That's all due to the MeToo movement.  So sometimes it's not even the fact that we need other systems in place (like legal) to act, but just the fact that it can create social tension is success enough in a country like India, where for centuries people were used to the wealthy abusing their power and the weak being unable to do a thing about it.

On the other hand, I agree with another comment that said that the movement won't get seriously taken off the ground unless the police and legal systems catch up with the urgency of the movement.  Because unless they do, everything will stall.  So we still have a long ways to go in that regard.

But keep in mind that in India, where social status is a huge thing, ""Log kya kahenge"" is a driving factor for a lot of people.  And if word gets around that you abused or harassed someone, that is enough to scare (I believe) many people straight.  Even that small influence reveals the (positively) disruptive power of the internet to change a society such as India.", m_aravind None depressedfrog420 spaceturd4 moombai None None rmtestmod roy1979 GoRush87

Can we have a desi version of ""fucking Karen""? There are too many aunties like these. She even has the haircut. I have faced similar situations in the past. Actually still do. There are a lot of women, ""aunties"" who say the exact same thing as this woman did. 

There was this one time when I was wearing a pair of shorts in my house and one of these aunties had come over, she kept looking at me in the most creepiest of ways and when she was finally done, she said ""don't you think if you wear clothes like this, your father will feel comfortable, when you cross your legs and sit in front of him and there's only going to be a tiny bit of cloth hiding your privates?"" This obviously infuriated me, but I don't think anything I would've said in my defence would register in her pea sized conservative brain. 

This incident reminded me of her and many others like her. If women don't stand for women, I don't know who will. Shame on them! You guys should checkout the insta story of the girl in skirt. They found some pictures of the Aunty in skirt on her fb page lol.

https://imgur.com/gallery/d9pJRJL Peeche toh dekho RIIIGHT NOW! RIIIGHT NOW!! 

I agree with the girls but God damn they are annoying as hell. This is almost like the infamous hughmungus video. Women who wear sarees have been rape victims too. Women wearing burka have been rape victims too. 

Small children wearing anything have also been raped. 

These justifications for rape are disgusting. No amount of dress is good enough for rapists to not rape. And certainly no one deserves rape. Pasting my comments from another post :

If anything like that happens to any of you, please know that there are concrete actions you can take on the spot against anyone (irrespective of gender) who calls for rape/molestation of another person in public or on social media.     

Not only is the awful lady in the video completely wrong she is also committing a crime, 2 crimes in fact. 

The first is outraging the modesty of a women and the second is  sexual harassment.



* The law (Section 354 IPC) makes it a special crime to use force against a woman, or **even threaten to use force, if the intention is to 'outrage her modesty'**. It treats it more seriously than normal and criminal force by allowing the police to make arrests for such crimes without a warrant.

The punishment is jail time of between one and five years along with a fine.

*Important*: It is not enough that the victim's modesty is outraged. It is an offence only **when the accused intended or knew it to be likely that the acts in question would outrage the victim's modesty**.



* According to (Section 354A IPC), Sexual harassment is the

1) Unwelcome touching or other physical contact

2) Asking or demanding sex or any other sexual activity

3) **Making remarks which are of a sexual nature**

4) Showing pornographic material which may include videos, magazines, books etc.The IPC is not limited to sexual harassment at the workplace, but punishes such harassment done anywhere.


The IPC makes it possible to file a criminal complaint if you have been sexually harassed.

The punishment for the first three kinds of sexual harassment is three years as compared to the fourth type(making sexually coloured remarks) which is one year.


Regardless of anyone's background or gender or age, calling for a violent crime like rape in public against another person for any reason is a crime. 

Victims can lodge (and should imho) an FIR against the person responsible. This remind me of case which happened a few year back, a South Indian aunty sent people to kill a girl for wearing jeans. 

And I don't understand why people are defending her, there have been many times where women had behave bad and their videos gone viral ( remember the lift girl) so why this is any different. Is it because of age or because the victim is women ??ü§îü§î Here is what the six girls had to say after the incident. Do have a look. This was a follow up to the entire incident.

"25, Seeking help",26,c628gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c628gl/25_seeking_help/,32,1561647113.0,"25, Graduated in 2016 from a tier 2 College, Worked in the telecom industry for 2 yrs and resigned in Aug'18 to prepare for civil services.

Although I wasn't exactly hardworking when it came to academics, I was a bright extrovert in school leading a happy go lucky life. Although I never topped overall, Used to top in English and Maths. Secured good marks in 10th and 12th boards again topping in English and Mathematics (I wasn't the only one). 
My weekends in school were spent gaming, playing sports and going out for movies or hanging out.
Same goes for some weekdays since my school used to end by around 1:30 PM. 

When it comes to dating/relationships/friendship with the opposite sex, I never had any female friends inspite of being in a co-ed school. Had fun, memorable times with the lads and never gave it an iota of thought.

Some of my friends' behaviour changed after 10th grade and they began going behind women, Becoming pompous and pretentious, and tried to act all cool; forgetting who they really were. The unity that was present until 10th grade had taken a nosedive. This did influence me to a certain extent, so I took further interest in gaming and now kept a closer, smaller knit of friends, eventually becoming an introvert. 

Fast forward to college life, The same thing persisted(Very few close friends, introvert) and although it was co-ed, I couldn't find any girl to talk to, matching my wavelengths in thoughts and deeds.
My college was conservative and so were the students there. I didn't know this before joining and realised that I had made an incorrigible mistake. It was too late to change colleges since a year had passed for the realisation to dawn upon me. 
I honestly believe that college years give you the opportunity to explore yourself and try out anything and everything. Having some sort of contact with a female was one of the things I wanted. Ofcourse, I wanted to have sex and one night stands but also to understand them better, maybe as a friend since I had never experienced the same. 

Even other things that people do for fun in college, like going on trips, partying, hanging out and mindless (yet fun) roaming around the city wasn't there. 

The most ironical part was that I was declared the most handsome guy in my batch in college and was complimented in school as well. 
(Even now, I'm being complimented constantly about my dressing sense, looks, physique and cheerful, fun loving nature.)

Somehow I endured those four years even though my health, academics, mood and social life went for a toss; and secured a job at one of the telecom giants.

So, summing up college: Depressed, Mediocre academics, No fun, Not much interaction with females, No close friends in my wavelength to talk to.

Job location was Pune and I had an inkling of hope that things would change for the better there.

The situation was pretty similar in the office as well. But I did have more female interaction though professional (work related) most of the time. 
My flatmates and workmates were not the hanging out/partying type so I was most of the time by myself with my laptop or going out alone (movies, restaurants).

Regarding the dating/hooking up scene, I've pretty much tried all avenues (Tinder, Happn, Bumble, Craigslist, Locanto, quack, Hinge and even at a few bars(But the girls were never alone)) without success.
I did meet a nice older woman on Craigslist and we had a nice time on 2-3 occasions (sex included). 
Once she moved out of the city, I've called hookers occasionally because I've never been lucky anywhere else. 

I was thinking of suicide but then I didn't want my parents to suffer so held back on it. Had I been an orphan or they hadn't been there, I would've suicided there and wouldn't be writing this.
Fortunately or unfortunately I survived.

I tried joining some clubs such as trekking, reading and tennis in order to socialise and find my tribe but everything was in vain. 

For some reason, I felt that keeping myself distracted and working towards something will keep these worries at bay. I did some research on career options and decided to take a plunge at civil services. I really liked the diverse work profile, ability to make a change, power, prestige, social standing and moreover, being constantly preoccupied by variegated tasks.

I resigned, returned home(Kochi) and for the initial 2-3 months it was going well. After that these old thoughts started springing up in my head and I couldn't focus fully. 

Here also I couldn't find any luck in having a vibrant social and sexual/dating life. So once a while (2-3 months), I hire a hooker and get it done with. 

I'm awaiting my prelims results. Even if I clear this stage, I'm bound to fail the next stage because I'm not fully prepared. 
I've decided to take another attempt but these thoughts keep getting the better of me every single day. 

Even here on reddit, I see many Indian people hooking up and having sex at will. Seeing all this makes me feel inferior and lowers my self esteem and self confidence. 

Occasionally, I think of leaving everything behind and becoming a monk somewhere near/in the Himalayas in case everything fails. 

I'm thinking of visiting a psychologist but honestly don't see it changing anything. 

I'd love hearing from all of you on this. 
Sorry for the long post. Couldn't help it.",HermitInSolitude,[R]eddiquette," You can marry , if all you want is sax. Suicide is a bad option. All the best for UPSC . I mean reddit is the vocal minority. Most of the indians need to marry to get sex. You are already ahead of the game if you have had sex already, so cheer up. 

Imo, sex is not that important in life. companionship is. try finding like minded people and making friends, would help you a lot in the longer run. Pa, naayinte mone.

You have thousands of users on here. And you see the success stories of only a very few people. I am pretty sure that they represent like only 5% of the regular users here.

Apologies for the expletives. But it needed to be said. However, most of the stuff you mentioned hit too close to home for me.

DM me if you want to talk 1) definitely meet a shrink. Civil services are hard already and cause a lot of stress, and you already are in a bad mindset.

2) for every indian guy getting laid, thousands aren't. Don't beat yourself up over it, rather beat yourself off. Even in apes, the alpha has a harem and the betas rarely, if ever, get lucky. It's a law of nature. Just let it go.

3) don't know about dating but you really need friends. Everyone does. unfortunately it is very hard to make friends when you're not in a school/college or have a job. For now you should participate in LNRDT. If possible, connect/meet with your childhood friends. Life is much MUCH larger than this. We forget to question ourselves what we really want and instead look around to see what others are going after. And most cases, it's wealth.

So, stop and find out. This is all the time we have together. What you seek need not be material at all. People find content in honing their skills, making comedy, painting, singing, gardening, or even just talking. 

Figure out how you can give unconditional love by accumulating experience. In case you're still in Kochi, Please feel free to reach out to me.

If you ever decide to become a monk, I'll come with you. It was important for you to breathe out whatever you have had experienced till date regarding friendships, dating, career etc. I would say talking to like-minded people would not make you positive in one day, but it would definitely give you some hope regarding life and existence itself.

The news of suicides in the past week generated quite a discussion here, and I wanted to foster some more of that. I read a lot of randians and heard a section of my acquaintances saying that suicide is never the answer, that there's always help for those who seek it, that he should have led the life he was advising others to lead. And trust me I raised these points and more to my friend (before his second attempt). His depression stemmed out of failing on the path of becoming a MD because of a death in his family. He said at that point he could not see anything helping him, that his family would be happy to see him die, that no doctor can understand what he's going through, and other extremely negative thoughts. Now what I felt at the time was no matter how I justify that killing your stupid self is not the answer, it did not penetrate his thick skull. No literally, he could not even identify with what I was saying. [He said it was like seeing the faces but not noticing the vase.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_vase) His brain didn't work that way. Eventually he did see the point and though he's still battling depression, at least he's battling. 

My point here being that not everyone has survived the attempt to be the wiser later. Some can't even see the point you're trying to make because that's how their brain is working at the time.

Truth is, you can try very hard, but in the end it might not matter. What I'd like to see is maybe more compassion(?) More education to identify the signs of depression in yourself and in others. I don't know. What do you think?",zarkingfardwarks,[R]eddiquette," I have felt like doing it once! Believe me, nothing makes sense to us at that time, we just want to erase ourself from this world. And if a person is willing to commit suicide, one must be with him all the time and actually find out the problem and rectify it, instead of giving him motivation speech which seems like empty, trash words at that stage of human mind. Its about being practical at that time. 
I quite agree with you! I have thought about suicide many times. But being the coward I am, death scares me. 

You know sometimes people talk about endless sleep. Damn, I wish it was real. >He said at that point **he could not see anything helping him**, that his family would be happy to see him die, that **no doctor can understand what he's going through**, 

These are patently false opinions he is fostering in his head. Do take him to a psychiatrist ... and tell him that to commit suicide, it takes being alive and doing things while alive. ""Kuch karne ke liye pehle zinda rehna zaroori hota hai"". If I'm not mistaken, he would have also spoken comparing his situation to failures such as ""to live is like expecting Zimbabwe/Afghanistan to win the world cup"" etc. It's amazing how complex this topic is if you think about it. I don't think educating yourself works. It's like preparing yourself to swim by reading a book on it but you can't hope to survive with just that when you somehow end up in a pool or lake. I personally believe the support has to be genuine professional and external. That's just my opinion though. I'm kinda scared of this topic tbh. My life has been going down hill for quite a while now, maybe around 6 years now. I have hit rock bottom and found that it has a basement and then that basement still has multiple floors under it, so i get that feel that when someone says that your death will benefit everyone and all things actually makes sense but suicide is stupid. I've cried, like really hard for nothing, had insomnia for months, lost tracks of time but I still say that suicide is stupid because it actually is. Over the course of my life I've seen many people suicide, I expect everybody has, in relatives or friends of friends, and all I can see is they chose the easy way out.

India's 6th largest city Chennai runs out of water,108,c21cu8,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48672330,22,1560887912.0,,thisappear,[R]eddiquette," According to quora (I know shit source) a $100 million desalination plant produces enough water for 300,000 people. If we build 20 of these for $2 billion (14,000 crores) we can produce enough water for everyone in Chennai. That's not even taking into account the reductions in cost by improving efficiency for building so many plants.  
  
Edit: the sorek desalination plant in Israel produces enough water for almost [2 million people](https://www.eib.org/en/infocentre/stories/all/2015-january-01/sorek-alleviates-israels-water-shortage.htm) and [only cost $500 million](https://www.desalination.biz/news/0/IDE-pays-533-million-for-49-per-cent-of-Sorek-desalination-plant/9038/). Quora seemed to have been right! Please spread the word guys, I've lost hope in National Media. Lives are at stake. Please save water. I think its time to close all the mineral water and soda companies that use underground water to begin with. And as always, the government starts doing something only when it's too late.

Ffs, any idiot could have predicted this happening. Stop ecological damage, stop destroying natural reservoirs and bring an end to the illegal tanker mafia. It's not going to give us immediate benefits but it's a start. What are they planning on doing when every single city in the country goes through this? When natural land is changed to impervious area, the recharge rate goes down and increases chances of flood as well. Unregulated development and climate change will keep on exacerbating this matter. I swear of God, I left my job in Chennai because of same issue and moved back to Ranchi. The very first thing I did after reaching home was taking shower. It feels good here, I came back yesterday. Cape Town: ""We had the biggest water crisis in history, no one can screw up as bad as we did!""

Chennai: ""Hold my lungi!""

Bangalore: ""Hold my call center!""

All other Indian cities: ""Don't worry guys, we'll get there next month and show these arrogant b\*tches who's boss!"" Indian cities are slowly becoming the most uninhabitable cities on this planet with pollution, garbage and now no water. We are all doomed. Unregulated growth/construction always has its pitfalls, and sadly this is the harshest of them. Monsoon season is on the way, every madrasi household should create a rainwater harvesting system.

Yesterday I asked my manager if we'll be getting the day off to go vote. She started laughing and said who even votes anymore. There is no day off and dont even get this sort of thing started in the company. I got pissed. Told her it was my democratic right and as per the law I was entitled to a leave. Her face went into ""Did this this corporate slave just tell me the law?"" and proceeded to go and talk to the HR. In the evening HR sent out a company wide mail saying if anyone wanted to take a leave to go and vote, they were entitled to do so. I thought I would be cheered by my fellow slaves but to my surprise none of them had any intention of voting and my manager is furious with me. Needless to say, I took the day off today and cast my vote. 

Also, I might be filling out the application form for Pradhan Mantri Berozgar Yojna tomorrow. Wish me luck bois. 

Jai Hind. request: go out and vote. 

then come and discuss here. Go out an vote people, your country needs you to exercise your right. Are the young not voting?  


While standing in line to vote my first observation today was that there were no millenniums at the booth. The average age of the vote ranged from 40-60 years. This made me wonder, are the young not voting? I messaged my friends who are part of this ‚Äúwoke generation‚Äù and have legitimate grievances against the party in power, did you vote? No, we did not. Why? Oh, because we don‚Äôt have voter id cards, our names is not on the list, how do we register etc.   


It is extremely disappointing to note that educated Indians aren‚Äôt able to figure out how to exercise their franchise. Indian Express recently published an article which stated that ONLY 30% of the voters between the age of 18-21 are registered. In contrast, the percentage of all eligible voters who are enrolled is 63.75 per cent. To quote that article ‚Äì   
‚Äú*Before the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, EC data showed that of the 1.79 lakh new voters on average in each constituency, the 18-19 age group accounted for about 24 per cent or around 43,000. The winning margin was less than this in 226 Lok Sabha constituencies in the 2009 elections.‚Äù*   


Why aren‚Äôt young people voting in India? 1. They‚Äôve moved in the past years for work, education etc and do not know how to navigate their way through the bureaucratic hurdles and get themselves registered. 2. There is no mechanism in place where a person can vote for their constituency without being physically present. 3. Or is it something grimmer? A lack of trust in the system, that feeling that one vote won‚Äôt make a difference so why put in the effort at all?   


P.S ‚Äì Mostly a rant but what were your observations at the polling booth today? The next time I hear Bengaluru and Chennai people complain about anything, I am going to give all them a piece of my mind. Less than 55% average voting. Voter turnout out was 92.3% (population  approximately 1650) in my village.

This was my first election where i was involved completely.

- Went door to door campaign in 24 villages in my mandal. It came to approximately 10-13km a day (Google fit)

- did door to door campaign in my village 3 times

- distributed üç∫ & ‚Çπ (i know)

- made sure everyone in village voted. Made calls to people residing outstation to come and vote (gave fare)

- arranged 2 auto rickshaws for old and disabled.

- gave a small speech on not to vote for corrupt and vote for development (was tensed, crowd of 1300)

- made sure polling booth arrangements (water, shade, chairs, preference to old & needy) and mock polling were right.

- waited till EVMs were sealed and sent (was 10pm)

- personal expenses of 30000.

More like society in general These idiots must be straightened by hook or crook Tougher the admision process is more the people are jealous of people who get admission through some quota even with less marks. I have seen this in Engineering as well. I dont understand why people dont think about reservation from the general candidates POV..a candidate with top rank getting a govt seat studying with his colleagues who got the same seat or better with a far worse rank sucks...and btw..there should be no reservation in PG at least because everyone receives the same education in MBBS...so everyone is equal after MBBs For medical you have to consider how to implement reservation , it's not about castism it's about merit - 
 How 
1 - General students  need to get 80% in NEET .
2 - But for sc/st it's about 30-35% , they doesn't have basic knowledge of biology but gotten admission in government college , many time they failed in college exam but due to pressure from civil society , teacher just gave them passing marks and passed them . 

Solve - 
1- give reservation student a class of 2 years before giving them admission in college . The cause for this is reservation. High time it ended. Instead of solving the problem it's causing more divide. It allows low caliber students to be given the same responsibilities and respect as high caliber, hard working students. 

Theres a very big difference between diversity and reservation as it exists.

It's not casteism when I might hate an underperforming general candidate because he gets to be a doctor while skirting through exams and never being serious in class just as much any reserved candidates for the same thing. 
If you see that theres more reserved candidates in that basket, it's not my fault. I just hate mediocrity.", Bapu_Ji waahmudijiwaah GL4389 lynndxunha3 manavkaushalendra sidcha Return_of_the_smack

I applied for an internship almost two months ago because I graduated and had nothing to do until I start my Masters. They replied after a week, then forwarded me to another person a week later, then another week later they took my interview and asked for a work sample a week later. Today, they tell me that I got the internship and I'll have to start within a week. My classes will start by then. This is one of the biggest educational institutions in India by the way. -_- A colleague confessed to me today of he being a gay . This fact was known to most of the people , but , today after his confession , first time I realised that how doesn't it  matter at all to me. He is just another guy who due to stupid reasons is always made fun of . He is a brilliant guy who did masters from IIT (no IIT meme please ) and far better than political dogs and bitches of office . Its sad that he lives alone and even his parents have rejected him.

So, I'll be taking a Lyft/Uber daily now. At ~$5/ride, it will cost me ~$2600/year. But fuck it, *aadmi kamata kyu hai*?

EDIT - forgot to mention sweat drenched back after walking to office. That won't happen anymore. So, I was out on a late evening walk and it rained. I forgot the last time I had a walk in the rain so I kept walking. Then I remembered my phone wasn't water resistant. But it wasn't there in my pocket. I forgot that I had kept it home and started to panic. I tried tracing back my steps, but couldn't find it anywhere. The rain kept pouring. I was like fuck it, the phone is gone, I might as well enjoy the rain and just stood in the rain till it stopped and then walked back home. And when I opened my room, it was all dark because there was no power. Then something started to blink. It was the notification LED. I felt like I got my life back. Been unemployed for a while. Applying on job portals is the same as throwing cv in a black hole, don't have many references or network for referral, walk-ins for backend,BPO,non voice say I'm overqualified. FML So what is /r/india's plan for the Area 51 raid??? Matched with a hot nri, today was a good day. So, basically packing up all my stuff before college and before it was like you know, okay. It was putting in the new clothes and shit, 8 usbs (for god knows what), a power strip, surf excel, cables to connect to different boxes together, transferring data and maybe even downloading Deltarune. And then nostalgia struck me like lightening. I started packing shit. Glitter, shells, small teddy bears, all of my loose change in a pesto jar, colors, watercolors, earrings I don't even wear, a music box, my lucky stone, 3 years old lip gloss (...wtf am I doing)

And when the time came I didn't even know if my Kidzos (Kidzanian money) were more important than my actual money. So I packed my Kidzos too. How do you get yours parents voice out of my head ?

Current time is well past 12 so i am not disrupting any conversations. I watched Article 15 today. It's a great movie although some bits can be a bit Bollywood like. I know I'm overreaching when I say this, but some bits of the movie reminded me of True Detective (Season 1) in terms of the shots and all. Like when Aysushman is doing some investigation and all. A really well-shot movie which is very depressing though overall.

Also, fuck those people who bring 2-year-olds to these movies. Some 6 to 7 toddlers were screaming their lungs out. Apparently, one set of parents went ahead and started playing nursery rhymes loudly on their phones for some 25 mins to pacify their child until someone complained to the manager and had them chucked out. While they were leaving the father was shouting you dunno who I am etc. Pathetic human beings. Hire a goddamn babysitter or something if you're so well connected. I was seriously depressed and suicidal at this time last year. I'm happy to say things have drastically improved over the past year.

Then in the afternoon, the upstairs neighbour asked if anyone of my friend was  trying to get into my flat at around 3:30am.

So dad was saying he got a WhatsApp forward which said Switzerland has a law that punishes drunk driving by whipping. and he got a video of the same. 

So I said no it is not possible (I am vaguely aware that Switzerland does not have any such law). So I googled. I was right. 

I asked him for the video. There was something written in Japanese in one corner, one naked guy bend over something and two girls in black suits were clamping his wrists over a glass half wall, whips in hand....

It took me five minutes to realize that it was an edited BDSM clip. 

I told him, it is fake news, please don't forward.

Trying to go pass through them, I dodged them as swiftly as I could but it happaned....I collided with one of them. Trying to stand I saw the person's face.  Red eyes with a face that hasn't seen a smile for a thousand years. A face so familiar. It was me I stopped.

I asked him "" Why are you sad ? "" . He burst into tears and including everyone surrounding him. They all were me. The ground that stood became wet because of those tears. Again I saw something glimmering ahead. Confused .... I ran

Before I realized , tears were already rolling down my cheeks.
Dodging them as best as I can , I ran like never before but it happened again .... I collided again. 

I found myself in a hug with a very tall person. Soon, i realized the person is a girl. She mumbled something. Couldn't hear her. I raised my head to see her face. Her face glowed, it blinded my eyes. Its like staring into the sun. Couldn't make out her nose or the eyes no matter how tried. At this point I dont want to know her face anymore. I lowered my head ,closed my eyes. While I was trying to build a question in my head, She hugged me back.

The anguish,  anger, sadness, anxiety, fear all disappeared with touch of her arms. She kissed on my head. I never felt that much love before. I was at ease . I could hear her heart beat , it was ....beautiful. I hugged her even harder.

I said "" one more time "" as I raised my head. "" I want to see you "" I said. The glow lessened , a face was beginning to form, my heart filled with happiness and then I....woke up.


This is the dream I had this morning. I never want  to forget it. Thank you very much for reading.

When I drink I drink a lot, no proper sleeping time or I can't sleep early :( Feeling conflicted and confused. 

Met current gf on a dating app last year. She's continued to be in touch with a couple of guys she matched/casually dated  last year. 

She insists that they're just good friends for her, though she later admitted that I was right in guessing that these guys hadn't abandoned their romantic notions even after knowing about us. She says she brushes off their flirting, and draws a line and tells them to stop when it becomes too much.

Today she's meeting one of these guys, who's officially seeing someone else, who says he wants to ""just be there for her"" when she's sick. He's been texting her daily, which I find to be a bit odd if you aren't actually trying to pursue someone. 

I'm not comfortable with this, but I don't know if I'm acting insecure or possessive. 

Ladies, if you're reading this, please tell me if I'm overreacting.

Thanks.

*Posted at 9PM* Maa ka birthday hai and 23 saal mein pheli baar apne ghar pe nahi hu. Don't know what to do in life, just living for the sake of it I had a very free day today. I used to love cricket growing up, stopped giving a fuck about it for years, but just started following cricket subreddit and keeping up this world Cup a bit. Took a trip down the memory lane today, saw what's my favourite cricketers like Jacob oram and others who I don't hear about right now were upto these days, watched some old highlights. I almost forgot that players like Shane bond and shaun tait existed when I remember a time when people were obsessed with them and their pace. So many old names that I forgotten about. Had an alright day. 

This is a thing that I think about a lot. *Things are only as important as you make them to be.*

God night guys. Have some sweet ketchup dreams. The year 1998 doesn't sound that far gone, but it's further away than 2040.

Original comment of u/TheRedstoneBlaze [deleted] Accidentally took printout for one of my project works in the wrong dimensions. There went 120rs., but not a big deal.

The technical head, however decided to make a big deal about it. That I'm ""wasting"" money (all the while simultaneously acknowledging that it is part of the learning experience).

He decided to give a lecture to me by telling me how there's an orphanage nearby the centre and that the children there are lucky enough to get one square meal a day and that it ""infuriates"" him it seems whenever he sees the printout that I took.

Ok, fair enough. But why bother telling it to me? Like as if I'm reckless with money and a spend-thrift? Does he know the compromises I've had to do so as to use my parent's money, as minimal as possible?

I'm not trying to brag, but I try to be frugal as possible. Ofcourse, that isn't to say I let myself a bit loose at times but ya, aside from buying outside food and buying clothes from fairly reputed brands (the latter is justifiable as they are tailored well and have better quality thus, making it last longer), I really don't spend much on leisure items.

I really hate it when I get accused or lectured about things that I don't tend to indulge in or getting reprimanded for things that someone else deserves to receive. What was the need for him to lecture me? Heck my own dad has never lectured me when it comes to me spending his money.

I really want to like and respect my technical head, but I am unable to, sadly. I feel like I'm actually getting dumber everyday or atleast that's how he makes me feel, constantly rejecting and chewing me off, for my works and ideas. I'm glad my short term course is gonna end soon. Been stuck in a limbo for 3 months now, in trying to complete my project (only for him to outright reject without offering me constructive advice/suggestions).

TL;DR- Accidentally printed the wrong size for one of my project works. Technical head guilt trips me saying how reckless I am with my money and lecturing me by saying how there are people out there who don't even get a square meal per day- implying that I'm careless and reckless with my money, even though I try to be frugal as possible so as to not burden my parents financially.

It also mentions not to poop near rivers and such, but nobody is heeding to that it looks like. I recently signed up on Bumble (Tinder's cousin) just to mess around a bit. Have never been interested in the casual dating stuff like tinder but I wanted to have interesting conversations and just wanted to figure out how this whole casual dating system works.  
I was just intrigued, wasn't expecting anything serious. Signed up, kept swiping. 100's of swipes.  
NOT A SINGLE MATCH. WTF!   
  
I am not the kind of person who values his self-worth based on other people's opinions or based on validation from others but for some reason this experience has decimated my confidence.

But if I don't go, then I won't get proper lunch. But if I go, then I'll have to walk 3 miles (total back n forth). Decision decision. It rained lightly whole day today. It's impossible to be productive on these kind of days. I watched John Mulaney's stand up special The comeback kid today. Also found out during watching it and googling afterwards, that one of my favorite song of all time is a song about band members breaking up, and the whole album was written by the cheaters, for the cheaters. Kinda interesting how every song has a story behind it. Have you ever thought about story or what's in musician's mind behind your favorite songs?

I still haven't finished studying and haven't started applying for jobs. But when I look back, in the last 8 months I've learnt a lot. Not only have I learnt about the topics I was interested in, I have also learnt about myself as a person.  
I do fall off track and procrastinate, and I am not as efficient as I would want to be, but I am making small improvements which makes me happy.  
Honestly, I hadn't really thought about these last 8 months until I clicked on this thread, and wanted to see if I had something to say.  
Thanks for this thread. I am grateful for all the opportunities and adversities that have come along my way. I am growing :) My blind student got selected as PO in SBI! Had not watched movies properly since quite some time.             
           
In the past week, downloaded & watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Black Panther & 12 years A Slave, in that order. Loved all of them. Happy :) There are a couple of stray cats in my colony and one of them allows me to pet her now!

Edit : Got it. woohoo Sitting behind dad on bike today I noticed, his hair is turning really white. Time is flying. Today there was a guy (30-40 age) working out in a speedo at my gym. Why do my parents fight so much!? Don't get me wrong, they love each other, but they'll also fight over the smallest, stupidest things. Sometimes I went out with friends without telling my mom,  so she gets angry. If I tell her, she'll get angry because 'you only want to go out with friends, not with me'. I don't know why she gets such thoughts. She says 'you are not so old that you don't tell me where you're going', but I need the independence now. They drive me insane sometimes and I can't wait for college to reopen so I can shift back to hostel. There's so much independence there, it's so hard to live without it at home. I think as long as I'm not earning, my only option is to suck it up and tolerate this. You cant see me my time is now you can't see me my time is now *starts dancing butt naked because nobody can see me* What are the sale timings for Zenfone Max Pro M2 on Flipkart? Trying to buy one since yesterday. How do i spend my last settled salary and my new 1.6lpm salary? Noob in aim and shoot games wants to play mobile pubg. Yay or nay? I'm not sad. But I just don't want to do anything. I like not doing anything at all. It's becoming a lost art. It's very therapeutic. Watched two movies, back to back - Alita, Battle Angel and Creed 2. And going to watch another one now. On a Friday. And it's not even 10 PM yet. Gave my laptop for ram upgrade, and the shopkeeper told me that my Hard disk crashed and i have to install the new one. I didn't believed him, took my laptop back and gave him 3200rs for installing the ram and then i formatted the hard disk and it started working normally but after 3 days the same problem occurred, and this time i decided to buy the ssd and replace the hard disk. So i bought Samsung evo 860 and tried to replace but laptop didn't detected the ssd. This time i went to different shopkeeper and gave it to him and he told me the hard disk connector was damaged and i have to change that and after 2 days he bought the connector and this time he told me that it got short-circuit and there is some other issue. He took 2 week and gave me the update that motherboard is having some issues and now i have to replace whole motherboard. I'm totally fucked up and frustrated, what the fuck is going on, either these shopkeepers are doing scam or maybe it's just a coincidence.

Let me know if you have some suggestions or anything you want to add to OP.

The thread will be posted on every Friday, 8.30PM.",avinassh,Scheduled," I had been writing a file manager called `nnn` for 2.5 years now. It's available on several distros and is quite popular among terminal lovers (it can also be setup easily as the default file manager on Linux or macOS desktop). It's full featured and is very lightweight and fast (the original goal was to write a performant FM on the Pi for my 3-year old).

If you are on Android, `nnn` works great in the Termux environment on Android too!

Home: https://github.com/jarun/nnn

I am looking for some contribution with setting up Arch Linux wiki and Wikipedia page for `nnn`. The content is already available.

Update: I am also the author of some other projects which you guys may find interesting. Do visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/jarun).

Update: I got some help. `nnn` now has an ArchWiki page. The Wikipedia page is yet to be added. I learnt awk sed grep this week!! How should a person with 2 years of Development should prepare for Interview? What is asked in the Interview? What are the do's and don'ts? Give me the power to crack these fuckall interviews I have started porting an old ActionScript tweening library called GTween to C#. It is very easy to write iterative incrementation in AS due to its unique frame-driven event model. In simple terms, it simulates a persistent background thread that loops infinitely for as long as the application is running.

What I didn‚Äôt realise all these years is how much easier it is to simulate concurrency in ActionScript, and how many more precautions and considerations have to be accounted for when writing multi-threaded code.

I‚Äôve hoisted a working version of the library on my GitHub at the link below. It comes with tests and a demo application. So seeing it in action should be easy for those interested.

https://github.com/pranavnegandhi/GTween.NET What would be the best way to learn Data Structure and Algorithms without any previous knowledge of it and keeping in mind that one can spend a lifetime learning it but I would like to do it in a decent amount of time which would help me prepare of interviews and focuses on problem solving itself. I can see Coursera has some huge specialization that I would love to do but it would take 6 months to do finish them and then I would probably also require another few months to work through problems which isn't a tenable amount of time I have in my hands. I would also like to learn it in a way that I could in future build upon the knowledge and go deep into it. I am currently considering Algorithm Part 1 and Part 2 classes on Coursera. Any algotraders here? I'll be entering college in about 20~ days. I'm curious as to why C is the introductory language to programming.

I mean I get that something like python *might* not be the best choice to learn about types and primitives etc but they could go with say, JavaScript ? Or Java/C++ maybe ? 

I think JavaScript would be the best since you can build stuff and see immediate results whereas in something like  Java you would have to learn processing/JavaFX to make things that look and feel somewhat like a real application.

Or is it because C doesn't abstract away too much ? Say I have a bash shell block inside a groovy function. From within that shell block, can I call another groovy function present in the same groovy script? Any embedded enthusiasts? I started programming tm4c123gxl. Interfaced a Nokia 5110 lcd and dth11 to make small weather station. I also bought a cheap ""logic"" analyzer and was able to use salae logic software to see SPI signals from the LCD. Planning to put it in a git archive soon. Hello, I'm about to enter my second year in college, and I'm interested in the field of Data Science.

I'm doing my undergrad in CSE from a tier 3 college. 

Please reply if you can even answer any one of these questions, it'll be a huge help!

1. Let's say I try for GSoC for Summer 2020, I'll need a backup if things go south. Will May 2020 be too late to apply for a Summer 2020 internship? When do companies typically hire for summer internships? 
2. Let's say I manage to grab a summer internship by the end of this year, can I decline the offer later if I get accepted into GSoC(results in first week of May) without any repercussions?
3. My college only gives about 1.5 months of summer holidays. So how does this work, do I tell this information to the company specifically and I'll have to work only this much or will I have to talk to the college authorities or will I need to skip classes in college? How does this work? I do know about a senior who's doing his internship in another country and has just started this July while our college opens mid July, so I definitely don't see him coming back in just 2-3 weeks. 
4. What level should I be at to get a Data Science/Machine Learning internship?
5. What level should I be at to get a Software Engineering internship?
6. How do I go about looking for an internship?
7. Internship vs research in IITs/IISC, which one would be better for me?
8. Have you participated in hackathons/meetups or such events, are they of any use or just BS?
9. Have you tried GSoC? What organization/field do you suggest? Is trying for tensorflow for next year too ambitious if I only know python/pandas/numpy/some math right now? I haven't even started learning machine learning yet.

Ideally, I'll be working towards both GSoC(Open source on machine learning/data science) and Competitive coding(DS/Algo and problem solving), so I can do GSoC in Summer 2020 and a Software Engineer internship in Summer 2021, anything I should be wary of?

[Previous threads here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search/?q=Bi-weekly%20Books%20%26%20Articles%20discussion%20thread&restrict_sr=1&sort=new)",AutoModerator,Scheduled," Finished *Three Body Problem* today. Will start *Dark Forest* tomorrow. I'm reading Annihilation of Caste by Ambedkar. I'd bought it a few months ago, read three pages from the foreword by Arundhati Roy, got depressed and left it. I picked it up again after watching Article 15 last week. 

I assumed his speech was about caste only but it's actually a criticism of Hinduism -  Hinduism cannot be separated from caste and to annihilate caste, you must annihilate the Hindu religion. I had no idea that he resisted the inclusion of Dalits into the Hindu fold (he wasn't interested in granting them entry into temples) and wanted them to convert to another religion.

I also read Ambedkar's paper titled Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development. I would recommend this to everyone. I finally understand what 'Brahminical Patriarchy' means (would smash 10/10). His perspective on how Sati and enforced widowhood developed in India is very interesting. Indian feminist movements cannot ignore caste. 

After this I'm planning to read Hatred in the Belly: Politics behind the Appropriation of Ambedkar's writings. Thinking fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman, not that bad. Completed: The Stranger, by Albert Camus. It was like someone held a mirror to my face.

Completed: Jonahwhale, a poetry collection by Ranjit Hoskote. I write some poetry and this came as a recommendation to understand the current poetry scene in India.

In Progress: Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius. Making slow progress here.

Casual picks: Leaves of Grass, by Walt Whitman and short stories of Saki are picked up once in a while.

Pending: Short stories of O'Henry,  Hawksmoor, by Peter Ackroyd and a bunch of stuff from Albert Camus. Just finished Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, and it was a great read! It's written in a very accomodating fashion and assumes that the reader is unfamiliar about what he's going to be talking about but at the same time assumes that they're highly interested. It's not a loud ""mindblowing"" sort of a book- all the facts/figures, metaphors and the storytelling is reined in and it just flows really smoothly right from the cognitive to the industrial revolution and beyond. Actual biweekly thread! Making me feel bad about the speed at which I‚Äôm reading this book I see. 

Halfway through **The Penguin History of Early India Vol I** by *Romila Thapar*. Hopefully will be done with the book before the next thread, really nice read, though it seems really condensed. It mentions a lot of stuff in a very short amount of space. I feel like I‚Äôd much rather read a drier, longer book which goes into everything in a bit more detail, but that‚Äôs just me I guess. 

Also halfway through **Crime and Punishment** by *Fyodor Dostoyevsky* which I had abandoned for Thapar. Finished a cool 25% of the book today! On my second reread right now, but I want to go back to The Brothers Karamazov after every other Dosto I read because he just sums up, and multiplies, all his other books perfectly in that one goddamned book. Last week, I finally finished reading Thinking Fast and Slow and oh boy! I am on a Behavioural Economics high right now!

Currently reading Predictably Irrational, loving it so far! Reading A Clash of Kings (GOT). Never in my life I thought that I could read such huge books with so much interest. The world that GRRM built just blows your mind. ASOIAF was recommended to me in one of these threads, I don't have your username nor am I able to find that comment but thanks man. I am loving it.

I am also looking for books similar to Imagining India by Nandan Nilekani. It's a book with essays on various topics of interest in Indian politics, economy, society etc., Hi. 

 I have started 3-4 books and not finished even one. 

 I need to change that.  I'm trying to learn fast reading. I saw a Ted talk about increasing the reading speed. Got me started. 

https://youtu.be/e2-ahs905MQ

If any of you have any resources, articles or tips for improving reading speed, please do share. Reading 100 years of solitude , the book takes its time but the magical writing and realism has me hooked After finishing my binge of Raja, Rasoi aur anya Kahaniyaan on Netflix, I'm gonna start Pushpesh Pant's India: The cookbook.

He always suggest to study something, be it novel or some skill. If you dont have anything  to study, read ABCD, you will find something new in that. We wait for perfect time to study but it will never come. Problems are going to stay but one can study in that problem. My brother says that study is his prayer to god.

By god's grace, he is very successful but he still study. From last year I applied his formula and it works for me. Just try this, it might work for you.

Looking for a full time role. Location not an issue. Has companies already started hiring for New grads and Interns for 2020. I saw this hiring challenge on HackerEarth, which clearly mentions they are hiring for next year.

 
https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hiring/american-express-hiring-challenge/ I got job around 4 months ago and I'm finding it irrelevant and boring. Around 2 months they kept me on bench after that they gave me ibm case manager training but they hired me as a java developer and now told me as I'm fresher so i have to work on whatever project they assign. After all these i started job searching but I'm not able to find jobs related to java (as i prepared for Gate so there is 2 years of gap after my graduation). Please give me suggestions, whether i should continue my job and is java is still relevant in the market if yes then why there is very less opportunity for entry level jobs in java? I have so many doubts and confusion, not able to take any decision. Looking for a job as a backend developer.

I have 2 years experience as a machine learning developer, working mostly in Python (using frameworks such as Pandas, Keras, Scikit-learn, Flask, Celery).

No location preference. I am from a shit tier college with no extra curriculars or coding projects against my name in the past 2 years of college. I am confused which field of CS do I branch in for a decent job. Some suggest Data Science and ML but I don't want to go for it just because of hype. Do both these fields have enough jobs in India? Right now I am concentrating on DS and Algo. It would take me at least 3 months of time to be decent at it. I would have just another 5-6 months after that,  before placements start. I am afraid if step into Data Science and ML and find it above my caliber I wouldn't have time left to learn other things. Also, I am confused regarding what other stuff to learn. Do I learn Advanced Java and various libraries and framework associated with it and follow the path to be a Java developer or do I  learn Web Development or Android Development. Either of them requires at least 6 months to be decent at them. Uggh.. I let my 2 years go waste. I want some way to earn money on the side. I can do gamedev on unity with C# and can edit videos or make simple illustrator graphics. Currently working at a startup for some mobile game development and learning web dev part time.

3. Location - Delhi or any city 

4. Contact - DM on reddit 

Thank you. In need of a major advice.

Ive recently got into work at an E-commerce firm. My responsibilities include creating social media posts , promoting the products(gadgets and accessories) , and any future requirement of their web and app redesigning.



 So, few weeks into the work, I am designing insta and facebook posts for different products and Ive designing different styles depending on the product. I commute to work daily, spend around 1.5 hrs in the train and I havent really found a reason to stay there.


 Recently theyve asked me to change the layout, and make a permanent one, which can be used for all the products, which sounds reasonable for them. But I dont find any satisfaction in it for me in the long run. Of course I dont find a future here, but still I can cling onto just to get a monthly payment and spend for myself. So Im thinking of suggesting the company to allow me to work from home. They only need about 5 posts per day, and motion graphics when required. 

What do you guys think? Am I doing the right thing? I would like to do freelance when at home.", PM_WhatMadeYouHappy adork_filter gstark1 wrongtake Humble-Fool incontinentia_butts blood_centrifuge deadsho7 kallu2u lycheesherbets finalodabeer

It was like school all over again. Ended up going to a nice Italian place by myself! Nadal is God of clay never seen such domination on a single surface. Was thinking from 3-4 days to text this cute friend from school,

finally texted her and she didn't reply. :'( Need some advice.

So I got out of a relationship more than a year ago. Now, there's this girl who I have a crush on, kinda. However, the problem is we talked only a few times during college, never after that. Also we live in different cities. However, we do have 1 common friend.

I want to take my chances, because it's the only way to find out what will happen, instead of not doing anything & speculating what could've been.

However, I am not sure how to proceed. And I am afraid of confessing with that common friend, even though she is a good friend of mine.

Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks. Girlfriend leaving for IIM Calcutta today morning. Gonna be a long two years, boys! [deleted] So, what do y'all usernames mean?

Now that vibing has just vanished and there isn't much  to talk. Feel kinda bummed as I thought that I finally found my ""buddy"" :( I don't know today I just feel nostalgic , I don't crave company of others  neither do I have strong friendship or such bond with relatives, still from early morning I am just reminiscing the time I have spend with friends in college or with my cousins, today I want to call every one of them but I just can't . I don't know how it happened but now I don't have anyone around my age just to talk to. Any tips to deal with exam stress. My engineering semester exam is near. I am just stressed out and can't focus on studies. I have this escapist mentality when I am stressed out, I try to do (or think) other things to avoid studies. 
This exam is really important for me. 
I just want to work more efficiently and clear more topics. Moved to a new place, few days back. So new roommates, and my crippling social anxiety is keeping me from talking to them freely, just like it has done for the last 8 years because of which I haven't formed a connection with another human being. And I'm incapable of feeling love or connecting with others because I'm so caught up in my own anxiety that I only focus on every little thing I do around others and stress over it and I forget to actually enjoy the conversation. Every little thing like, where am I looking, am I making enough eye contact, am I saying the right things, was the tone of my sentence correct, oh no I stuttered I bet they think I'm weird, etc. stresses me out. 

Anyway I wish I could be normal, or better yet, not exist at all. How do you deal with excessive daydreaming? I've had it since my childhood days Hello guys i am tired from life there are many issues in life. 

1. Family issues - My father is farmer and we are having debts due. My mom keep fighting with my dad evertime many times a day. Also my father attempted suicide once i can't forget that day. We have yet to build home for getting bride as per our society norms at that moment we have kaccha makan.

2. Career Issues - I am not settled yet anywhere even i am 25. Dropped Diploma polytechnic due to financial situation then cleared 12th. Depressed and having suicidal thoughts sometime after going through such situation from long time. Total hopeless now.
No good friends never been in a relationship there is nothing interesting in life. I have insane amounts of anxiety. Have had it all my life. There is also a major life change coming up soon which has been seriously stressing me out. Have had to stop myself often from having suicidal thoughts. I left my job and went back to my parents as they wanted me to be with them, I thought they'll help with seed money to start my business (i belong to a typical business/baniya family) now it's been two years I'm not able to find a job neither  do i have the seed money. I've lost all my confidence and feel sad all the time. I'm torn between my aspirations and expectations from my parents Finally visited a psychatrist last week. Was having repeated panic attacks and depressive episodes. A little better now and have joined a gym but I still tend to completely fall apart at the smallest things going wrong.

Oh, and a Cities of the Future. That one is good. 

Also I was bingeing Kumail Nanjiani's interview clips on YouTube last night. He's so cute. Then I watched The Big Sick. Loved it! Finished Chernobyl - absolutely amazing, strongly recommend

Then I see I wasn't showering with fresh water, but from tubs filled with dirty laundry of others. Eww. Then I see, oh there's a borewell behind the bathroom and bucket full of fresh water. I go there to shower. Some time later, I notice 2 women are also showering 10 feet away from me, but with all clothes on of course.

A guy in my college got slapped and kind of publically shamed. 

His best friend told him to do it cuz apparently the group of friends had gone to the movie a few days back, and the Boy made a joke on the same scene that "" Yeh real life me toh nahi hoga "" , to which the girl he had a crush on ( who also was part of the group ) laughed out loud. Naive mistake, he assumed that the girl laughed on the thought that it wasn't possible in real life. Plus the best friend backed him ( like Bhai Tujhe hi dekh rahi hai )

So, the morning class gets over, he takes the girl to a kinda secluded spot and leans in towards the cheek.

The girl doesn't approve , and slaps him instead.

The sound of the slap causes the people to turn back and see what has happened.

The girl shouts at the boy for like 5 minutes, then the other girls chime in and the boy starts crying. He begs for mercy.

He gets mercy, but he still is going apologizing to every girl in the college.

Plus his best friend learned an important lesson.

Idk if its my problem, or Im caring too much. I find it really difficult to talk to people. Everyone I talk with starts to ignore me, or kind of contradict me in any way possible. I wait, and listen to them talk, and when my chance comes up, its contradicted and ignored.



These days, I want to stay away from people, just do my work and move on. Also the depression has taken hold of me in a very menacing way. I dont feel joy in anything, and life is in a downward spiral .


Am I wrong? Where should I change? How can I make life atleast 'okay'? Life is very hard for a jobless graduate.

I want to do something else but family is forcing me to do something else cuz I was unable to get job in my field since a year.

I'm depressed and then family pressure, I don't even like to talk with anyone let it be family or friends. Loved someone but could not say anything to her and then here I'm crying every single night cuz of all this from 1 year.

Family take me as a joke. Started getting anger issues as they were forcing me, mood is mostly off, there is no one whom I can say my feelings.

All this tension and family pressure is killing me from inside but don't know why I'm still alive.

Depression is a joke in India, no one understands until you suicide. Everyone at my home is super busy. I live with my mom, and her two sisters. All of them are busy with their professional lives. Due to this, they come home tired and we have our dinner at 2 or 3am. My sleep schedule has become pretty erratic.
    
I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate on my studies because of my aunt's constant yelling. It's like she can't accept her mistakes and constantly blames everyone else for her life. The same aunt has a 10 year old daughter who can't walk or talk because of severe cerebral palsy. I feel like my aunt  deliberately stays at her office so that she doesn't have to face the stark reality at home. This has taken its toll on me and my brother who are effectively forced to live our lives according to our cousin's needs. We're forced to take care of her everyday her mom is outside the house. This has led me into a downward spiral of guilt and depression. 

I used to be a good student but I now I'm just another brick in the wall. I feel so utterly lost. Any mention of how things aren't right with our family having late dinners(at 2am or so) and me sleeping through the day(except for going to my coaching) gets me a severe yelling from my family about how I'm making excuses and how I'm trying to blame them for my low marks. I don't know now. I feel so tired of this unproductive lifestyle but every time I try to make a change, my family does something to bring me back again and I'm back to ground zero, yet again. I don't have any friends and my  dad is out of the picture.

I used to be so innocent and full of life, marvelling at every tiny change in the hues of the sky and somewhere along the road, that part of me just died. I've become so bitter, and cynical. I barely recognize myself anymore. I want to do better and I know I can. I don't know how to get out of this rut. I feel like I'm looking for excuses for my eventual failure and I feel guilty for letting down everyone who's ever believed in me. I don't know what to do. 

Help me. My life is became black hole (context from earlier mental health thread https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b222o4/mental_health_discussion_thread_170319/eisdoxv/ ) the more I try to get out of it by discussing with friends, problem is worsening for me.

This weekend only I tried to connect with two friends but no one have time for or are busy with some other things :( We're all a bunch of pretentious fucks [deleted] I have major anxiety and some insecurity issues that I feel like are getting in the way of improving myself

Doctors breed patients, police just look for their own gain, teachers just beat the shit out of kids etc etc etc. They die for money and they kill for money - these people won't let go a 10 paisa coin from gutter. I feel like I am trapped and don't know where should I go. Because even we trolls sometime see that enough jokes and something needs to be done about it. If I can't change the world, I should atleast change myself and my surroundings but can't see anything past the smog. We are doomed.

What are some relevant resources available online. Plij halp and do the needful. Books by Narsinmha Karimunchi for interview preparation. Are they any good ? Has anyone used it ? Also, has anyone used interviewbit or leetcode for practicing  the questions ? Any other tips would be appreciated for interview prep. I was just going through [Angel.co](https://Angel.co), most of the jobs are looking for Android Developer/Web Developer and here I am trying to learn Machine Learning from AndrewNG and learning Computer Vision. I am a 2nd year B.E. CSE student. Should I learn Android Development first? I'm thinking of going in the field like game developing. Abhi toh bohot time hai but kahaa se start Karu? Konsi language pehle learn Karu? Any advice is appreciated :) Anyone into augmented reality development ? I want to learn C++ purely for solving competetive coding/interview type questions. The reason being that my primary language Python often gives TLE for valid solutions on certain platforms which have a smaller time limit than others. I also use C but thats really only good for tree and linked list type questions. The lack of hash-table etc kind of data structures and the need to write every small thing which other higher level languages have in their stdlib is too painful.

**What I want to know is**: what are the things someone coming from C needs to know to get started with competitive coding in CPP? I dont have the time to dive deep into the language and understand the nuances atm. I supoose I will learn that sort of stuff as I go along. For now, what all should I look at? Should I jump straight into STL and templates or is there anything else I should read up beforehand? I am just getting started Python.

What are the websites you'd suggest for learning and improvement? Are there entry level jobs for Java developers available? Most of jobs I see are looking for experienced people.

Have been working in a service based company for almost a year. I have realised I'm not gaining any valuable skills/experience working here.

I graduated in ECE. I can say I learnt nothing that can make me employable in 4 years of college. Have been learning Java for the past few months. But some of my friends suggest to learn JavaScript with AngularJS/nodejs,or learn Python and related frameworks as that will help me become more employable and few jobs are available for Java.

  


Can anyone advise what should I do? I feel I'm running out of time and if I can't find a better job in next 6 months, I feel I'll never make it in the IT field and may have to find alternative career options.

Should I stick with Java or move on to JavaScript/Python? 7th Semester Btech student here. What skills should I aquire to make myself employable after completing the course? I don't want to get stuck in service based company like Infosys or TCS. 

Honestly I was kind of forced  into Engineering. Screwed up first 2 years. But now I started clearing out back papers. Learned the ""tricks"" to pass B.Tech exams.I just learned that life is unpredictable and you can't always get what you want. What I can do though is to make most out of what I have. 

Now I feel like I should stick with Software industry and then progress to managerial roles. I want to get into the industry, might work for couple of years to make money to immigrate to do MBA abroad.

I used to be one of the those guys who are like ""do what you are passionate about"" and shit. Now my biggest motivation is money. At some point of my life I want to run my own software business.

Guys please help me out out what software skills should I acquire to get into the industry. I have one more year to complete course, I want play my cards right after that. Screwed up lot of times in life, I don't want to screw up again (at least try not to). Interviewed at a startup today, they expected a 6 day work schedule, long working hours and were mentioning that even data annotation is the role of an engineer, I know startups can be demanding a bit but I felt like this was a bit much.

I work ina remote city and I live alone. Not like I don't love my parents, but the excitement of being at home fades in a couple hours only after reaching home.

I feel bad about it. My collagues ask me why don't I take leaves and visit home. It's difficult to explain and I feel something is wrong with me I don't have much to say . I have accepted the reality of life and what it has to offer for me . And I will probably live through it till the day I die . Okay I think it needs to be said especially when it's a thread made solely for mental health. 

Whatever low and depressing thoughts that you have,  like 'I am done with life now',  'There is no point of hard work',  'It won't improve. I feel hopeless',  these all are not normal thought sequences.  These are common in depression and depression is a clinical disorder.  It can be treated and managed by going to a psychiatrist remember that.  

If you are feeling depressed for more than 2-3 weeks now with getting tired easily and not able to get the same pleasure from things that you like are symptoms of clinical depression.  So don't hesitate to go to psychiatrist.  They won't judge you as it is their job to treat this to their best ability. I just seem to have lost zest for life. Everything is bland and pointless. Grinding through the weekdays to idle and waste away on weekends. I am dissatisfied with where I am in my life right now. Everyone I know seems to have progressed leaps and bounds ahead. It's not that I didn't tried. I did with all my might but things didn't worked out due to some reasons. Now it's kind of like I have accepted my fate. I don't even want to try.

&#x200B;

I have stopped interacting with my old friends. I know it sounds very vain but I feel absolutely worthless and incompetent in their company. They will be talking about their wonderful life/job/relationship while I silently rot inside. I am so far behind in every sphere of life I can think of. And the thing is I don't even want to do anything about it. Just idle and waste away. Loneliness and solitude reign the weekends. Apathy and indifference on the remaining days. I don't feel like there's any point in life sometimes The girl I told  I had a crush on and got rejected by  now works with me. She told everyone about this. Even though I try to act cool it hurts at times. She behaves very rudely with me. I can't change my company as I have signed a bond of 2 years. Anxiety disorder is a real fucking bitch. I overthink everything until it doesn't make sense and then I freak out. Have panic attacks randomly. Can't handle the smallest of issues and conflicts without feeling like I'm dying.

My relationship with my bf is also getting strained because of this. It's sad also because he's genuinely the best I've ever had, and he loves me a lot. I keep panicking about us and keep feeling like he deserves better than me, which is sort of becoming a self fulfilling prophecy. I'm afraid that they'll leave me, I become clingy/distant and then they actually leave. 

Don't know what to do to break the cycle, accept his love, and just deal better with life. I am an engineer. Fresh Graduate.

I joined 2 weeks ago in a Finance Sector as Bussiness Analyst and Product Manager.

New job has a lot of expectations from me.  
They say no questions are silly. But, I can't ask silly questions.  
They don't care where I get the data from or how do I do it.  
They just want it done.  
And that's what i am to deliver. I am hugely intimidated. Guys Hear me out, I have just started my corporate job and I m not liking that, my anxiety disorder isn't helping. I already have a decent gate score. Part of me wants to drop it all and prepare for IISC Scared about a lot of things. Off to IIT BHU next month with electronics if I get it. If not, electrical. Always thought cracking Adv and fulfilling that childhood dream would be something special. But now, it's like the life has been sucked out of me. Terrified about leaving home, leaving my mom behind. Keep worrying about job prospects, how to maintain GPA, how to pursue my tentative dream of an MBA, how to adjust with the honestly challenging living conditions. The list goes on. In a long distance relationship and I miss her terribly nowadays. Won't see her for a year because she's preparing for medical entrances in Kota. And I don't want her to get demotivated or distracted because of my stupid angsty drama. Dad is mildly disappointed because he wanted IIT KGP but I'm not keen on pursuing chemical. He doesn't smile nowadays at all. Not expecting any advice as such. Just writing out stuff that I can't really share easily anywhere else. I need to ask because I haven't really spoken to anyone about this. How common are suicidal fantasies (among depressed people)? Whenever I'm having a panic attack (quite often) I imagine putting a bullet through my brain or a sword going through my heart or a guillotine decapitating me. And its been happening for years now. I know it's unhealthy but I have no frame of reference for this but I've never even read of anyone thinking like this so I guess it's not very common.Also fantasizing like this makes me feel good.

I am planning to start investing in mutual funds but the information available online is just so overwhelming that I don't understand how to start. 

For now I want to start small maybe a Sip of 1-2k pm for 3 years. I might start another SIP in this period once I get a hang of it.

My question is where should I get started to learn about it? Any blogs, youtubers which provide quality content about the same, which can help me decide about which MF to invest in. Hey folks...What are your views on buying a used car with 1 lakh+ km on the ODO? 

My friend is leaving for a job abroad and is looking to sell his car which has 1 lakh + kms (2012 Honda city model), since he has not much time to find a buyer he is offering it for cash settlement of a decent discount compared to the market price of such a car on used car portals.

Car itself is in good shape with maintained records, service history, only minor repairs like bumber change, door repainting etc. No serious accidents of any kind. But it has been driven a lot.

Does anyone have experience with buying such used cars? How long are they expected to run post 1 lakh km, before engine work needs to be done to keep it running?

Pls advice on this,

Thanks! I've made FD for 5k since 2 months. As I don't earn that much, this is max I could save. Is this good enough? 
Also should I invest in SIP? Will be doing job from this month. 15-17k per month. I have zero knowledge about finance things like tds, ppf and all. I only have one savings account. Will I need anything else setup too? Not sure if this is the right place for this. I'm going in for a planned surgery next week. I've filled in my insurance forms through the TPA desk at the hospital. The total estimate provided by the hospital is 3.7 Lakh. My insurance cover is 3.5 Lakh. I have agreed to pay the additional 20,000Rs. 

However, my insurance provider has only released 1.5Lakhs to the hospital. Does this mean they won't be covering anything more than that? I have tried reaching out to the provider but am not getting any definite reply from them. I am a student and I am applying for an education loan from an international organization to study abroad for which I need to mandatorily procure my credit report. However, I have never taken out a loan or any credit before. I tried CIBIL and CRIF to obtain a credit report but I received a similar response from both of them. 

CIBIL said, ""Based on the information you have provided during enrollment, we could not locate your credit data in our records."". 

CRIF responded thus:  We could not find any Loan or Credit details for you and regret to inform that Credit Information Report cannot be prepared for you. We thank you for your interest in CRIF Credit Information Report."". 

&#x200B;

Now I'm a huge fan of Nehru and dislike Indira more than I did earlier. It's sad to see how much our political class has declined since independence. There were so many intellectual giants in politics back then. Nehru's speeches for the 1952 elections are in such sharp contrast to what we see today. I'm also beginning to appreciate that despite all our flaws, we've at least managed to remain a democratic country, in spite of the doubtfulness expressed by the West. 

I'm at the chapter where Rajiv Gandhi is ruling and I'm beginning to understand why people accuse the Congress of appeasement (in a historical context). His stance on Shah Bano was just terrible. Our activities in Sri Lanka at the time are also shameful, and it's strange how we're okay with interfering in the internal matters of neighboring sovereign nations but when they do it, we're quick to brand those actions as terrorism. It seems that we don't have much of a moral high ground in these matters. Reading my third Stephen King book, ""The Stand"" and its such a great read. King's character building is so fluid and some of the best that I have ever read. Mixed with such an interesting plot (post-apocalyptic world), the novel is a fun read. Reading *‚ÄòThe Rise And Fall of the Third Reich‚Äô* by William L. Shirer Reading **History of Early India** by *Romila Thapar*.

And honestly for some reasons, I feel so old now. Especially when I see 18/17 year olds (be it online or in the real world) discussing or speaking about getting themselves enrolled onto a college. 

Doesn't help things that random kids call me as ""uncle"" nowadays (they've been calling me that since my college days though) and sometimes people even assume I'm in my early 30s (the latter really stings though- being misjudged for looking 10 years older and all).

I mean a few years back, I was in that very same predicament and phase in my life as they are in, right now. 

Honestly looking back, those 4 years of college life feels a bullet train ride as in, it elapsed so fast.....it covered a ton of distance all the while it also felt equally ""quick"" and thus, I feel I couldn't grasp all that I stumbled across, while on that journey/ride. 

I really got to learn and witness many things (can't be said the same for academics, sadly), had the privilege of having wonderful batch mates. And in spite of all this, my college life wasn't something I'd consider to be ""lit"" or ""vibrant"".....for it was pretty mundane and bland due to the institution I studied in.

And simultaneously, I also feel that in those bullet train ride-esque 4 years, I couldn't learn many things and couldn't help but feel that I've missed tons of wonderful opportunities and experiences.

I really feel that I'm a perpetual youth- a student who is trapped inside a physical medium that will inevitably age, detoriate and decay. 

Hope I have a vibrant 20s even though right now, my life is so muted and desaturated, devoid of anything exciting or ""eventful"" that makes one wish to live further.

TL;DR- Feeling so jaded and old even though I'm only turning 23 in a few months, especially seeing 18/17 year olds discussing about their college enrollment. Feeling like a perpetual student who is unfortunate enough to be trapped in a decaying physical medium. SBI customer care is quite shitty, people handling the calls are so robotic, they dont even care if a response doesnt belong to the domain of replies that they expect.

My name lies on the uncommon side of the name spectrum - meaning it's not very popular, and people have a hard time comprehending and pronouncing my name correctly. I called up SBI to get my card unblocked. In spite of being a male (and registering the same in the records), the lady kept calling me Ma'am. In between, I pointed it out to her that ""I'm not a lady, pls don't call me Ma'am. I'm an adult male."" But she goes ""Sorry Ma'am, I couldn't get your response, you have to tell me your Date of Birth"". I was like, fuck it, and went along with her. At the end, she transfers me to another lady to give feedback. This other lady also starts off with saying Ma'am. Anyway, I give the customer service 2 out of 5. When asked the reason for giving the rating, I explained her that I'm a guy and in spite of telling this to the service rep, she kept calling me Ma'am and that they should correctly check the records before addressing someone. Now this lady also goes ""Sorry Ma'am for the trouble. I hope that next time you don't face any problem."" 



I was like üòêüòêüòêüòêüòê When I was a kid, I hated ghazals, old bollywood songs, folk etc and was mostly into metal, rock, punk etc genre. At that time, dad said that I'd like those songs when I will be old enough to understand the meanings. And nowadays, I've starting liking those and was listening to Koyi Faryaad today. Dad smiled at me. I was kinda embarrassed :p Day N: life is still mazak. Heartbreaks are real. Can't get over this one goddamn girl and she doesn't value affection at all. My office is celebrating International Yoga Day tomorrow. I am the fun officer at work and we have a team to come up with ideas for these things. We were discussing what to do tomorrow. I suggested having a desk yoga session and then ordering subway salads for everyone (healthy and shiz). Everyone liked the idea and the HR approved it. Despite having an allocated budget for these events, my boss decided that we can get packets of bread, cucumber, tomatoes and butter and the office boys can prepare sandwiches for everyone. And then she said that you'll get one half of that sandwich. THE TRIANGLE!! Not even a complete sandwich!!!

Decided to chuck the idea. I thought we'd go back to the original idea but she came up with another one. A hawker sells poha near our building. They will get poha costing 10 bucks each for every employee and 10 rupee chai cup from another guy below. I am so angry and I'll be so embarrassed!!!!! You don't know my struggle I had walk to my bedroom switch to turn off lights since WiFi is down right now. what's up with LNDRT participation going down each day? Women screaming, kids dying,

This thought has been on my mind for a few years, especially considering the fact that I'm not able to look after myself in the first place! i am depressed as fuck. i made this account as a throwWay but am so lazy that i use it now to interact on reddit.

i feel i am just coasting from day to day with no aim, goals or desires. felt shitty last night after plans got cancelled. snuck out of home and went to marine drive. I also smoked my first cigarette. i don't know why i did it, I always found smoking disgusting. but I wasn't thinking straight and I'm afraid to say I loved the buzz i got. a nicotine addiction is the last thing I need right now, i don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life Have finally decided to emotionally let go of a best friend of several years. Dude ghosted me and it filled me with anxiety about being absolutely unlikeable, considering I'm (25F) the quiet one who finds it hard to easily make friends and he's (24M) the popular one who gets along with everybody. We graduated from college, went our separate ways, but still kept in touch, except conversations started becoming heavily one sided. While I'm flattered that he finds me a safe space to talk about his fears and embarrassments, I'm more than a dumping ground, and he hadn't been acknowledging that for a couple of years. I suggested therapy, because his fears are negatively impacting the way he functions, he refused. I suggested talking to the girl he likes and is chewing my ears out talking about her for months, he said no. I finally put up boundaries, telling him it's getting too much for me at this point (at several moments, until I became explicit about it), he ghosted me altogether and stopped replying to texts I sent the days after. It's been a month. Time to let go for good now. It hurts, but it seems like a lost cause. I genuinely care about him as a friend, but holy shit, it's such entitled behaviour from him, considering he's a postgrad in psych and knows my mental health isn't the best either. Just broke up a serious relationship. Please help Can't really stop reminiscing about the past stuffs. Even the mediocre times have turned into something incredible in my memories. But everytime something something similar from the past repeats in the present time ,  the anxiety kicks in. Yeah sure 8th grade was really fun but no way I wanna live through something similar to those anxious and lonely times again Struggling with low self esteem since forever. Jo confidence at all. Single since looong. Getting to the age where people say I should get married. But I don't even earn much! My therapist suggested to me to watch my breathing mindfully numerous times a day which I haven't been able to do. It is especially difficult to do at work where you can't focus well. Secondly, as soon as I had to do it numerous times a day it became a chore.

Do any of you practice mindfulness? What do you do? What has been your experience? I  am a cannabis advocate and support legalization. I know that this is a very serious issue and I do not wish to spam/troll. I just want to point  out that a recent study linked legalization to a drop in suicide rates.

I do utilize by 8 hours fairly well but I can definitely be more focused at work. The reason I am saying this is because my health is not well. And it is not getting any better. If I bring work home or work more than I should then it is definitely good but takes a toll on health.

On the other hand, if I don't bring work home then I will probably end up watching TV which is worse than bringing work to home.

We discovered the share certificates recently and I wanted to take stock of possible earnings.

I was able to find out that the company has since changed its name twice.
Also it seems that it **has gotten amalgamated into one of its sister companies and converted from limited to a private limited company** in 2017 and is hence not listed on the exchange.  
However, I cannot find the scheme of amalgamation process.
If the company was voluntarily delisted, I suppose there would have been a buyout process.

So, I have the following questions:

1. Would I be able to recover any of the money now?
2. Will the company have set aside any amount for those who had not come forward in 2017?
3. Who/what should I consult for help in this matter?
4. Since the amount invested was Rs. 1000, will the charges of recovering that amount be more than I can possibly get out it?

Finding it really difficult to get hired because people cite a lack of experience, but I've only just completed college. Amazon is hiring for BI Manager role. Here is the job posting:
https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/822017/business-intelligence-manager

Job location is Bangalore.DM me if you need a referral. Before I get into details, here is some background about me: I live in a small city in Gujarat, and this city is a business hub. You will find very few IT companies, that is if you even consider them IT companies.

Yesterday, I went for an interview with this company that seems like an actual IT company. Before I met with the HR, I was asked to fill a form with my details in which I was supposed to fill my expected salary as well. Being a fresher and evaluating my own skills, I wrote 4 LPA. During the interview with HR, he mentioned that expecting this salary would be fair in a city where there are plentitude of IT companies but since this city isn't one of them I l should expect less. Spent the next 4 hours going through all the rounds and getting the job. Today, they called to inform me that they want me to come down to the office on Monday and decide on my salary. 

Tbh I don't care a lot about money provided I get at least 15K per month. However, I am getting a feeling that I will be offered less than that and it has me worried.

I really want to take this job because their work looks good and I will get to stay at home with my family for at least a year before my bond expires. Another reason for being adamant about this job is that my mom has undergone knee transplants in both her legs and the doctor has advised her to spend at least a year resting with bare-minimum household work to fully recover. I want to stay here and be of help to her.

I wanted perspective about factors that I should keep in mind while negotiating, and to also be able to get the best package possible from them. Any advice for a student who is going on the job market later this year? I'm a final year engineering student from a mediocre college in Mumbai Uni with a mediocre GPA. I'm looking for a frontend (+ a little backend) dev position in Mumbai or Bangalore. 

I was wondering what's the job market like for entry level js/react devs. Is it a buyer's market or a seller's? What's the going rate? Can you negotiate? Any other interview or career advice in general? Looking to get hired. Skillset : Post Graduation in Economics, Basic HTML, WordPress, Digital Marketing (SEO)

She was really lucky.

I don't know if I inherited her luck, but I do hope I inherited his patience. Cold vacant spaces, hostile blank stares,

Venomous words, stifled despair.

Also please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6V29X7f) server to discuss on this, we have a separate channel #mental-health exclusively for this topic.",ppatra,Scheduled," Guys please use this. I think we need to acknowledge our mental health more. A lot of people don‚Äôt pay attention to their mental health and over time it becomes a part of them, and that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs hard to go back and start over. So, take care yourself physically and MENTALLY! I should be thanking reddit as it was a precursor to my recovery. I joined it last year. And it was in one of these threads I vented about my mental health. I did it twice and  the response turned out to be life-changing. Internet has some power and I got some relief that my concerns were legitimate. When people on internet are ready to listen to your story it gives you inner satisfaction which you can't even get from your friends and family.

Went for therapy (2 sessions). Got out of toxic friendships. Stayed mostly on my own, made new friends. Tried new hobbies, started reading books again (I hadn't read any in past four years). Earlier whenever I used to talk about my story, I would start crying. Now I don't feel like it. 

Depression does some real damage to your brain. It caused me epilepsy and my parents thought it was due to my studying habits. Not all parents or friends are good. Some people are inherently good (you'll be lucky if you happen to find one), some are inherently bad and some are in-between and they are the worst kind. This society has made us believe that other's approval is far more important than our own. Add social media, career, relationship, looks and the concoction would be enough to cause anyone some amount of injury to mental and emotional health. 

I see my friends venting about how their lives are unfair. I can give them sympathy and offer some solutions. But it is up to them to come out of this pain. 

Life is short, really short. You don't know when you're going through a good phase of your life. And life is strange too. It makes us confuse our priorities. When there's some health issue our lives get even more complicated. Not all people can afford therapy or cut people from their lives (kyuki circumstances). Time cannot heal your wounds. You have to heal it on your own. 

One thing I did a lot was writing everything about my life. Keeping your thoughts to yourself causes more injury. If you feel like you'll be judged or something, type it down and don't read it. Write about every single event that embarrassed you, angered you. One can't keep on adding water to the already full cup. You will have to empty it out at one point. I'm trying to escape from my partially emotional abusive dad, by staying in a PG near work. I've told my Mom about my intention, she's still processing it. I've given the false reason that there's a lot of workload and commute time, but actually I don't feel comfortable at home. It feels like I'm walking on eggshells. After a recent confrontation where I told I'm depressed, I don't talk to my dad much, so the outburst and abuse towards me has reduced now.  I want to feel free, and achieve my dreams.  Are there any repercussions to be scared of? I don't feel motivated to do anything. I masturbate almost every 2 hours. I sleep most of the time. It's like I'm already dead.

Life seems like slavery. Introvert. Fell for a girl in +2 five years back. Thought she'd be the one I would share everything with. All this without even talking to her. When I finally did, got rejected. Been depressed ever since. Used to cry a lot during my UG 1st year. Food was the only thing that used to make me happy. Started eating outside almost everyday. Luckily got a good job amid all these. Thought things will change.

But, Got diagnosed with IBS( Irritable bowel syndrome) last year,  Vit D and B12 deficiency this year. Got a minor surgery done recently. Spent almost 1L on hospitals in 8 months. 

Don't have anyone to share my feelings. Still cry very often. Just living one day at a time, hoping things will get better. I literally have 0 friends. I have no place to vent. I feel so damn alone. Spoke to one of my old school friends last night. He's been pretty depressed lately. He had to end a five year old relationship because his parents are completely against intercaste marriage. He's a Jatt Hindu and the girl a Jatt sikh. Imagine.

He had a pretty bad fight with his parents. His mom threw a pretty bad tantrum and cried a lot saying crappy stuff about the girl and how his life is getting barbaad. He asked them to stop saying all this, it's not like he has cancer but according to his mother, isse acha to cancer he hta.

I am shocked and can't stop thinking about how fucked up Indians are. Im bipolar. Had my first full blown psychotic episode in my late teenage. Its been years the psychosis is gone, but still feel as if i havn't recovered from it. All that is left is long periods of depression, nihilism and self pity. I think, my two+ year long so called depression phase has come to an end. When you hit rock bottom, everything seems unfair, but it's not. I used to sit numb all day in my hostel looking at the ceiling and what not. Your perspective changes a lot during times like those. And now, sometimes, it gets difficult meeting new people and unwillingly telling them about your ""hard times"", but it's ok. I know people have it real bad. I just want to say, flashbacks will never end. You have to deal with it. Meanwhile, trying to focus on the present and forget about the past. Let's see how it goes. I messed up CSE prelims yesterday. For the second time. I had put in so much effort for last one and a half year. All in vain.

  


I always wanted to pursue civil services. My interests were always in resonance with what it needs to prepare for CSE. I had quit IT service sector job for this. Gave it all I could with my hard work. But now, I can't help but feel incapable. I have lost my confidence, I have lost my enthusiasm to learn, I am afraid what future beholds.

One thing I am blessed with is people around me. They have always supported me. But it hurts a tad bit more to let down people who were by your side, every single time.

  


I hope I feel better in a few days, but right now I feel down and out. I will be seeing a therapist towards end of June. Been planning it for almost an year now.

Right now I'm going through super stressful times career wise, what are small habits/changes that helped you sustain for a week or two without breaking down?( When you're literally on the edge)", desi-mogul None ParentsAreNotGod designate_throwaway jashu1602 xScar_258 None bipolarthrowaway444 wackenadoIV souled_monk valkyrie108

The book made me realise the importance of being educated and how sometimes we take it for granted.

Next up Nationalism by Tagore. Completed A Game Of Thrones now reading A Clash of Kings Just finished Tim Marshall's Prisoners of Geography - it's like an ELI5 version of how geography has influenced nation building and continues to influence current politics. I think there is a similar portion in Sapiens comparing the geographies of Europe and Africa and how it contributed to the rise of Europe. This book is similar, and concentrates on 10 geographical locations - USA/Europe/Russia/China/India-Pak/Africa/West Asia, but is a bit too simplistic IMO. Completed letters from a stoic by Seneca and Sleeping on Jupiter by Anuradha Roy recently. Reading Aurelius' Meditations and JM Coetzee's In the Heart of the Country now. **The Idiot** - *Fyodor Dostoyevsky*  
Really good book, but I feel like his ideas are much better presented in C&P and TBK, and that a lot of what he tries to portray through the characters falls kinda short (at least for me, I couldn't find the characters themselves as compelling as they are in TBK). Still, well worth a read!

**Stoner** - *John Williams*  
/lit/ meme, but a good one, just like No Longer Human and Notes from the Underground. For some reason, it really reminded me of Siddhartha (probably the ""guy doing shit in his life"" theme and the writing style? I don't know). Really depressing book though, just makes you sit back, sigh, and re-evaluate your life choices when you're done with it :P

**A Hero of Our Time** - *Mikhail Lermontov*  
Most early Russian novels seem to share a similar tone, and I'd probably slot this in there too? I've not read any Byron, but probably should since the term ""Byronic hero"" turns up a lot when referring to Pechorin. Novels like this seem to kind of almost leave a mark on my mind but not really, like it is unmotivated and dreary to read for the most part, but you still go through with it and ""get"" something from the book even though you're not really into it the entire time. Or something like that, fuck I have no clue what I'm saying.

**Dubliners** - *James Joyce*  
Fucking hell, I'm finally done with this book. I'm probably not reading Joyce again until I feel like my mindset has changed considerably enough to maaaaybe appreciate him. All the short stories were well-written, agreed, but only one or two of the stories actually interested me. Is that the point? Am I shit at this? Probably both, but I'd rather read Nabokov over Joyce if I want good prose.

**Kokoro** - *Natsume Soseki*  
A Stoner, Siddhartha-ish book. I realize I'm probably generalizing too much, and if you look into the content by itself, they're probably as far apart as possible, but I kinda get the same vibes from these books. I've rated all of the above books as average or just above it, probably going through a phase where I'm not really feeling it, or these particular books are so. Probably re-read some favourites once I'm done with The Gambler which I'm on right now. Finished: How to Win an Indian Election by Shivam Shankar Singh. The book details his personal journey working on election campaigns for different parties in different states. He talks about the flow of money into politics, how insanely expensive campaigns are and how it leads to the businessman-politician nexus, the use of propaganda, fake news on WhatsApp, and how parties exploit communal faultlines for electoral gains. The last bit was my favourite. He went into detail about how Ibobi, the CM of Manipur, created a division between the Nagas and the Meiteis to win the state election. Riveting. 

Finished: The Verdict - Decoding India's Elections by Prannoy Roy. This book was essentially a bunch of statistics with explanations. Some interesting points were the three different phases of the Indian voter(pro-incumbent, anti-incumbent and presently, 'wise'), the dramatic increase in female turnout, the lack of representation of Muslims (and the reason behind it), why alliances matter so much, how polling works. Very relevant book right now! Crime and Punishment padh raha tha, beech me chhod diya. Don Quixote bhi 370 pages ke baad chhod diya.

Kuch accha suggest karo. Just started A thousand splendid suns by Khaled Hosseini. Some 60 pages in and plot has started moving forward. He paces his stories really well. I'm reading Manufacturing Consent, and to be honest I find it underwhelming. Chomsky has presented his case as to why media is a propoganda tool using case studies but I find it tiresome. Is it supposed to be like that or am I doing it wrong? How should I approach the book? And what other works of his should I read or prioritise? Reading At the Existentialist Caf√© by Sarah Bakewell. I just want to say all of you guys read really great books especially non-fictions. Keep reading. The best inspiration to read more comes from people who are reading.", richi942 PatruWalrus m4ycd11 isidero itouch4g bbigbrother sfwaccountfw longgamma RimDumDim None None

Whatever people say, Mumbai is the true spirit of India. Most cosmopolitan, most welcoming, straight forward, no bullshit city. My emotions are at play here, but that city is where my heart lies, the thought of someday going back there keeps me moving. My love for that city knows no bounds. 

PS. I'm originally from Jodhpur. Sorry for the rant. TIL there are hills in Mumbai Western Express highway??? Shoot this in Delhi and you'll have whole screen covered with black smoke Beautiful. I'm halfway there to buy a GoPro because it's a pain to shoot pictures and stitch a timelapse on computer. Could you recommend something cheaper that can create a timelapse?

Actually earning credit from Torrent Power. My brother did the calculation and the breakeven for us is around 5 years, which is way better than I expected. We also have a rainwater harvesting system from our rooftop that has been very sustainable. Are solar panels useless in rainy season?

Are they waterproof or you have to remove it in this season?

How much they cost if I want to setup for small house?

Any cons? Step one: own a duplex house with a roof and enough terrace surface area in a city. I added solar panels total capacity 3kw grid tie system at my home,  initial cost are high but you are set for 10-15 years without maintenance, panels are getting advanced and efficient coupled with wifi monitoring and lithium battery, quickly charges and can power everything, only problem is rainy day but even though it manages to power lights for a day or two.
It reduced my overall electricity bill significantly. What's the initial investment though? Hats off to the lady. Wish people get inspired by her.

What do you mean by this ? Ofcourse! The solution to every fucking thing is RELIGION. What is hurtful to see is a neuro-""scientist"" trying to ban this and that too by making a religious blocking site. Instead of putting shame on people watching porn that ""scientist"" should be ashamed of calling himself dr. or a scientist.


Though you can restrict porn and condemn sexual urges but that is just going to supress libido in teens which later become sexual frustrated adults and do rape, eve-teasing and sodomize infants. The neuropsychologist James W. Prescott has formed a startling cross-cultural statistical analysis of 400 pre-industrial societies and found that cultures that lavish physical affection on infants tend to be disinclined to violence. Even socities without notable fondling of infants develop non-violent adults, provided sexual activity in adolescents is not repressed. Prescott believes that cultures with a predisposition for violence are composed of individuals who have been deprived-during atleast one of two critical stages of life, infancy and adolescence-of the pleasure of the body. https://www.firstpost.com/india/indians-most-sexually-satisfied-in-world-yet-rank-among-unhappiest-nations-what-explains-this-great-disparity-4395899.html

Beware! Your smart TV could be peeping in bedroom,60,cbgduu,https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-beware-your-smart-tv-could-be-peeping-in-bedroom-2770365,37,1562792247.0,,GL4389,Science/Technology," I don't have tv in my bedroom. Who would want to watch me fap? How? Do TV have cameras now? Great, I guess whoever is peeping into mine is a necrophile. My TV doesn't have Camera but my laptop have a tape on their webcam. TVs rarely have a camera. You are much more likely to be snooped by your laptop webcam anyway, if at all.

What you should be more concerned about is your devices listening to you. If you are using Google Now, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, etc then these devices are probably listening to you all the time and are collecting that data to target ads at you. I'm pretty sure Facebook also does this because of their thirst for data. TV manufacturers are also doing that lately as there were several reports of Samsung TVs showing a similar behavior.

Seroiously, stop buying these IOT devices. Stop trusting random services on the Internet. If it is cheap (Xioami) or free (Google services) then they are probably making money off your data. Try and use Open Source software whenever you can. Stop using Google's services. 

Use the following :

+ **Phone** : Lineage OS supported phone with MicroG framework and Yalp Store for Google Apps + FDriod.
+ **Search Engine** : Duckduckgo and Startpage ( when duckduckgo sucks).
+ **Computer** : Anything not a chromebook and that can support Linux.
+ **OS** : Use Linux, with everything moving to web you probably don't need anything other than a web browser. I recommend Linux Mint for a beginner.
+ **Browser** : Chrome spys on you all the fucking time. Logs you in the moment you log into your google account and collects all information about your browsing habits. Use Brave Browser for a good privacy focused default configuration or use hardened Firefox with privacy protective extensions.
+ **Email** : Gmail reads all your mails and learns about your behavior and collects information about you through your mails. Use protonmail. It is a great alternative from a trustworthy company.

Some might laugh at me for being so concerned, but mark my words. Your data and privacy will be the most important thing you will want to hold on to in the future. The above recommendations are just a start. Read up https://privacytools.io for more information. The size of our population makes for a surveillance nightmare. I don't think there are many TV's with inbuilt cameras, this might be true, but still sounds like a fake story. I don't know of any smart tv's in India which comes with a camera attached to it. This is all fake news, and a click bait title. TVs don't have cameras. Bruh moment Oh no!

Although India should also increase its nuclear energy. Solar is not always reliable and it needs a lot of space for the farms. Which means a lot of forests need to be cleared. Interestingly 6 of the worlds 10 biggest solar plants are in our country - 

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_photovoltaic\_power\_stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_photovoltaic_power_stations) I was in Bangalore airport last week and there was a screen telling that a large part of the power for the terminal comes from solar. Dont remember the data but it saves a couple of thousand tons of co2 from being released in the air. This should be done for all our airports and train stations. They could use house roof as solar plants. Make it on grid. And plant more forests. Would be a better idea than using barren lands. form being carbon neutral, alog with renewable energy we need mass tree plantation all across the nation. Major cities this year noticed highest temperature in last decade. But can we ensure that this does not happen again

https://youtu.be/fVvUy5RRKf8 Hearing good news from foreign media because Indian media just shows bullshit. They should add solar panels on all metros and metro station.

I really like the work Cochin is doing in regards to their metro and transport systems. I see people here are uninformed abt the solar waste with the increase in its capacity.

A neophyte analysis between Russian Chernobyl and Indian Bhopal disasters: TIL a chemical leak from a pesticide plant in India killed and injured more people than Chernobyl,105,cdjlp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdjlp0/a_neophyte_analysis_between_russian_chernobyl_and/,15,1563236852.0,"In the intervening night of 02 - 03.12.1984, around 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas (MIC) accidentally leaked into the air from a pesticide plant managed by Union Carbide Corporation (now owned by Dow Chemicals), engulfing surrounding slum areas and suffocating tens and thousands. ‚ÄúChildren, women, old men dying and dead on the roads. Carcasses of dogs, cats, chickens, goats, buffaloes, cows, birds lay everywhere,‚Äù read a New York Times article published a week after the incident.

**The direct cause of the Bhopal gas leak is attributed to the presence of water in a tank containing liquid methyl isocyanate (MIC)**. Liquid MIC is a chemical intermediate meant for the production of pesticide Sevin. Now, this chemical is stored in underground tanks under cool temperature and optimum pressure. Large amount of water enters tank no.610 on the night of December 2, 1984. This tank contained atleast 40 tonnes of MIC, more than the safety rules permitted. A run-away reaction begins which is speeded up by contaminants (iron residues from corroding pipelines). The mixing generates major increase in temp/pressure forcing the venting of toxic fumes.

Like Chernobyl, the Bhopal disaster was a man-made nightmare, with scientific & investigative reports pointing to negligence, government oversight, managerial defects and state-level maladministration.

**Chernobyl/Bhopal**
Neither did scientists and Soviet leaders at Chernobyl nor did Indian authorities and officials of the multinational corporation anticipate such levels of catastrophe. The worst thing, though, in both the cases, was the risk management. Poor crisis response aggravated the situation and inflicted damages that could have been averted or at least mitigated.

**Parallels between Chernobyl and Bhopal**

Both occurred in the 1980s with an eighteen-month gap between them.

Both accidents unfolded at mid-night during night-shift sessions.

Although both resulted in explosions (A nuclear reactor detonates in Europe while in South Asia, a large storage tank of chemicals blew out of its concrete chamber following an uncontrolled reaction with water), Chernobyl‚Äôs ‚Äòimmediate‚Äô death toll was lower compared to Bhopal where thousands perished.

The two tragedies were blamed on ‚Äòoperator error‚Äô and led to the arrest and prosecution of individuals.

The Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station and the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide plant were constructed in relatively backward regions. Soviet Ukraine was a largely agrarian economy. **Madhya Pradesh was one of the least developed areas in India at the time. The state launched incentive schemes to attract factories and companies. Rapid industrialization invited large group of people, workers and migrants looking for jobs; many settled close to the factory. **During 1983-1984, the local government approved sanctions to let residents stay in these localities.

HOT (Human, Organisational and Technological) analysis reveals that administrative and managerial weaknesses contributed significantly to both accidents. In the case of Chernobyl, experiments similar to the routine maintenance test which led to the nuclear meltdown had been carried out before. The technical factors that caused the toxic leak at Bhopal had been identified previously but never fixed. In 1981, three years before the debacle, seepage of phosgene gas (component of methyl isocyanate) killed one of three employees assigned to shut it down. It was understood the person took off his gas mask in a contaminated area. At least 4 more leaks were recorded until 1982. **Safety lapses and minor mishaps were common occurrences at the Union Carbide factory.**

Workers broke safety rules because of organisational pressures. The need to generate electricity and meet the demands at Chernobyl pushed employees to skip regulations. Commercial pressure dictated events at Bhopal as the company cut back on safety provisions and maintenance practices as profit margins plunged.

Fundamental design flaws existed in both the plants, such as the ‚Äòjumper line‚Äô in the pipework at Bhopal that led to the entry of water to the MIC storage tank, and the positive void coefficient at Chernobyl RBMK reactors which led to a positive power coefficient (sudden power surge) at low power outputs. 

Operators had access, and were allowed, to disable key safety equipment, contributing to the accidents. While there was considerable component failure at Bhopal (the failure of the pressure valve of tank no.610), there was no apparent component failure at all at Chernobyl. Around 26 November 1984 (a week before the catastrophe), a Union Carbide employee tried to move 42 tonnes of liquid MIC from one of the three storage tanks to the processing unit. Though nitrogen was sent in to enable the transfer, tank no. 610 failed to get pressurized. This was a sign of leak.

Both accidents were exacerbated by managerial failure, information dearth and system related errors. The refrigeration unit meant to keep liquid MIC cool under 10-15¬∞C was **shut down**. The vent gas scrubber, installed to neutralise the poisonous gas in case of a leak, was put in **passive mode**. A pipe leading to the flare tower, capable of burning remaining gases going from the vent gas scrubber, was **disconnected.** The alarm siren was **switched off** immediately after starting it and only restarted once the leak became severe.

Poor perception of severity of risk compounded workers‚Äô problems. In 1985, one year after the incident, many of the workers were interviewed. According to a Times report, almost all the workers said they knew methyl isocyanate (MIC) was dangerous and some said they knew it could be fatal, but a dozen workers said they underestimated its toxicity. No one said they knew it could kill many people quickly.

Both accidents resulted in extreme, life-threatening health problems. Victims of Chernobyl suffered from nuclear exposure of varying degree from mild maladies to ionising radiation. The effects on Bhopal gas victims were far-reaching and some, still unfolding - **blindness, cancer, birth defects, depleting fertility rates, respiratory disorders, intellectual disability, body deformities, environmental contaminants like lead, mercury in breast milk of nursing women, babies born with fused bones and holes in heart.** One survivor is quoted as saying, ‚ÄúThose who escaped with their lives are the unlucky ones ‚Äì the lucky ones are those who died on that night.‚Äù 

The Bhopal factory lacked quality instrumentation. (The pressure indicator control and level indicator of the MIC tank and the temperature indicator alarm were faulty for a long time. The instructions in English were not comprehensible for the operators. The initial practice of employing degree holders and imparting 6-month training slowly caved-in. Some among the workers were high school graduates). The Chernobyl station, by contrast, was considered a fine specimen of the Soviet system‚Äôs flagship technology. The employees, who were highly-trained and well-paid by the country‚Äôs standards, felt confident that no major accident was possible and thus, did not hesitate to ignore instructions.

**The 1984 poisonous gas leak in central India, to this date, remains the world‚Äôs deadliest industrial disaster.** 3,787 deaths were confirmed by the state of Madhya Pradesh. In 2010, in a curative petition filed in the Supreme Court, the central government sought compensation for ‚Äò5,295 deaths‚Äô. However, activists claim 25,000 people died so far as a direct result of the disaster and the continuous chemical trial left behind.

We will never know the true extent of Chernobyl‚Äôs damage and death toll. It's been 33 years and yet, the exact scale of human sacrifice and the number of displaced remains a secret and a much-debated topic. Around 600,000 liquidators (many among them affected) from around the Soviet Union were sent in to assist with the prolonged containment procedures. Between 1986 and 2000, a total of 350,000 people were displaced with the exponential extension of the exclusion zone. It is said that deaths range anywhere between 4,000 to 93,000 over the years. A Belarusian study estimates total cancer deaths at 115,000, in contrast to the World Health Organisation‚Äôs tally of 9,000. **The Soviet Union‚Äôs official death toll is listed as 31.**

&#x200B;

Chernobyl station's second-in-command, Nikolai Fomin, was only appointed because the party felt he was ideologically suitable. The ministry that was concerned with the Soviet nuclear industry, Ministry of Medium Machine Building, opposed his appointment but were overruled. Later, Fomin did a correspondence course in Nuclear physics. So much for highly-trained employees.

&#x200B;

Likewise, the nuclear power plant's boss, Viktor Brukhanov, got the job because he had a reputation for getting the job done and not because he had a background in nuclear science. He was an electrical engineer! At one point he even handed over his resignation after he realised that the task of building Chernobyl properly with the ambitious deadline was not possible. When his resignation letter was rejected, he started to cut corners just like everyone else.

&#x200B;

There was one other guy who was sent to work at Chernobyl even though he only had experience working with nuclear reactors in submarines. That guy also died.

The current status where space is free for all will only last while access to space is limited, expensive and is not a source of significant revenue. That will soon change. When that does, likely during our lifetimes, countries will HAVE to come together and hash out laws and ownership for space. At such a time, nations which have a permanent presence in space (not just launching rockets and splashing back down) will have a bigger say in how those laws are framed and implemented.

One news item that makes the round every few months is about Indian government's grand plans to make Indian roads fully-electric.

Is the government just memeing? As everyone knows, India has no viable EVs in the market. The only electric four-wheeler is the aforementioned E2O (which Mahindra discontinued). All the other EVs on the market are either e-rickshaws or shitty Chinese scootys.

To add to that, there is no charger network. None whatsoever.

Against the target of 70,00,000 EVs by 2020, India has met just 1/10th of that by 2019. Worse, the number of four-wheeled EVs sold in 2019 was a mind-boggling 3,600. [source](https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/ev-sales-in-india-cross-75-lakh-mark-in-fy2019-412542)

China has shown that with concentrated action, you can do a lot to promote EVs. The country promoted EVs aggressively in 2009 and within a decade, has the world's largest EV market.

Moreover, within a decade, nearly 6% of passenger cars in China are electric.

Meanwhile, India is poised to reach the 5% EV penetration target...in 2030 [source](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/210483-kotak-merely-5-indian-cars-will-electric-2030-a-3.html)

How on earth does India plan to achieve its lofty EV goals? Given the precarious nature of our environment and the horrible air quality in our metros, shouldn't promoting EVs be a priority?

But they have launched another car called eVerito. eVerito is already used as taxis by a company called BlueSmart [[Blu Smart To Increase Mahindra eVerito Fleet To 500 Cars ](https://auto.ndtv.com/news/mahindra-blu-smart-launch-electric-ride-sharing-service-in-delhi-ncr-2047846)]. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONzV0zAwnl4) is a video of their ride sharing service. Ola Electric has already announced plans to bring one million EVs on Indian roads by 2022 and set up an ecosystem involving battery swapping stations.
>Ola Electric Mobility unit in March raised ‚Çπ400 crore ($58 million) from investors including venture capital fund Tiger Global and Matrix Partners. It also raised $300 million from Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors and formed a strategic partnership with the South Korean duo to help build India-specific EVs.

At least 11 EV cars are expected in 2019. Some of them include Hyundai Kona, MG ezs, Nissan Leaf, WagonR Electric (may be 2020, at 7 lakhs on road, [test video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VHbS6lQqqI)), Mahindra eKUV100, Tata Altroz, Tata Nexon, Renault Zoe. Tata Tigor EV [was launched today at 10 lakhs](http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/2019-tata-tigor-ev-launched-at-rs-9-99-lakh-after-fame2-incentives/). The FAME2 subsidy for this model amounts to Rs 1.62 lakh. [This](https://www.fame-india.gov.in/ModelUnderFame.aspx) seems to be the official list of subsidized vehicles.

Mahindra seems to be completely production ready with its Treo 3 wheelers ([factory tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a8xTj_hbbs)). 

Buses are where I am most excited. Under the FAME2 scheme, EV buses get good subsidy. These are some of the stories that caught my attention:

**Regarding Charging**

The biggest challenge right now is charging time. Most of the Indian manufactured cars I saw so far have a range of 120-150 km per charge. The highest I know is from Hyundai Kona with 300-450 km (but expensive at 20-25 lakhs). From what I understand, quick charge may not be possible at homes since it require high current (could be wrong). One way some companies are trying to tackle the charging issue is with the help of battery swapping. This article has some good info: [To put electric mobility in fast lane, firms push for swappable batteries](https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/to-put-electric-mobility-in-fast-lane-firms-push-for-swappable-batteries-1561655633564.html).

[PlugInIndia](https://www.youtube.com/user/pluginIndia/videos) YouTube channel has a lot of info on the state of EV in India. my friend work in mahindra garage. he e2o reva is worst and requirs too much maintenance.  ev for wheel is not alternative for india There are so many challenges to make a cost effective and good quality bulk production.
I don't think they even know about them This  was universally opposed by all manufacturers. I don't think our government gives a heck about environment, it is most probably due to [Crude oil being 18% of total imports](https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/ind/). A cut back in this would cause the Indian economy to rise up, due to lower trade deficits. While the current market condition is really poor, smooth transition should be the key for developing a sustainable EV market and not disruption. As with all such big bang reforms and policies such as Indirect Tax reform, IBC, this change too itself will take a lot of time since such reforms are not at all easy in wake of on ground realities. I am guessing this sudden enthusiasm for EVs is because the government is serious about developing a flourishing and sustainable eletric mobility market in India. If there's a consensus on the issue that electric mobility is the future of transportation and not ICE based vehicles, I see no harm as to why government should not be sending out strong signals to the automotive sector. Agreed that currently the industry is reeling under stress but since this is an opportune moment for India to gradually make the shift to EVs, then why not. Do remember that such infrastructure based reforms in India take their own sweet time and some emphasis has to be supplied in terms of government signals to the industry. Okay, first things first. We don't even get proper electricity to dry our sweat and light our homes. Where will charge our cars. 
The renewable (edit- energy) production and its penetration for the needful is aweful. 
The charging infrastructure is impossible even in 20 years. 

Simple petrol pump where people fill 100‚Çπ or 1.5L petrol, keeps us waiting 10 minutes sometimes more in peak hours, imagine the chaos on charging stations, which take half an hour to charge cars. 
The technology is not ready yet, its very expensive, if inexpensive, its downright hideously inefficient. 
So, keeping the goals realistic, we should see changes in 30 years. Atleast in India, where everything is slowest.


And why only cars polute environment, its the coal we burn to produce electricity. Renewable energy is shit here we know. But what's the solution? Bring in the nuclear energy. I may sound counterintuitive, as world is shutting them down, but its the need of developing India. Targets are most definitely going to be missed. But that does not mean we should not have ambitious targets.

Making an EV that's practical for city usage is easy. 50 kilometers range, charged every night, easy enough traffic conditions.

Making EVs that can do cross-country is hard. You need range, charging infrastructure, and it needs to be affordable on top of that.

Tesla's model of using high-end premium segments to achieve economies of scale, and subsequently offering cheaper vehicles is the right one. They are still having a difficult time pricing below $30,000. The bulk of auto sales in our country happen under $10,000 (=10 lakh car including GST, road tax etc).

Not sure how this gap is going to be bridged, but it seems we're going to make the jump to EV, and no harm in a govt. setting up ambitious targets, trying to execute and succeeding only partially. India likes to imagine and masturbate at the thought. Once it has jizzed (PR), it goes back to its everyday routine. Niti fucking aayog had given 2 weeks to 2 wheeler companies for presenting a plan on 2 wheeler electrification. The infrastructure just isn't in place for EV. For a country as large as India the private sector alone cannot support building the infrastructure. The approach should be phase wise wherein cabs and rickshaws be migrated to EV first, two wheelers is too big a segment to focus on right now. > Is the government just memeing? As everyone knows, India has no viable EVs in the market 

Indian government is pretending to move on to electric cars to appease to urban base that cares about environment. It's neither moving towards, or even wants an electric India (for vehicles). The new FAME 2 subsidy rules were actually a set back in electrification, all the Indian electric cars are not longer available to retail consumers (The TATA Tigor and e-verito) owing to a condition that only car models exclusive for commercial usage would get the FAME subsidy.

India also wishes to do a china by having an in house production for everything, and fails to realize that there's a lot required in supply chain isn't ready here.", kuttichathan tombraideratp tradeind27 pm_me_tamil_nsfw 16avril whateveruthink334 jawaharlol crazyfreak316 2viceRemoved f03nix

Not comparison with Hollywood movies. 

When it comes to space programs, I hope countries unite to deliver cost effective exploration with sharing of technology. Afterall earth is our home beyond moon. I don't understand the point of this comparison. For one, it doesn't take into account the cost of all the R&D that went into previous Indian space missions, which are critically important in making the feat of Chandrayaan-2 a reality next week. For two, this comparison is even stupider than comparing apples to oranges, this is more like comparing fruits to furniture, or something as absurd. If this article had to make a comparison, it should be done with other missions to the moon. I can't say for sure, but I think this mission would compare favourably even then. Just tell the price you idiots. Next time aim for costing less than last episode of game of thrones Here we go again. Comparing a space program to a Hollywood  movie. I know this is suppose to something to be proud of. But maybe this shows that we should be paying our scientists and other people at ISRO better. A lot better in fact. Why everytime we compare it with a movie? Because of cheap labour.  China can do for cheaper if they send mission to Mars.


Also, VFX labour is cheap in India too hence MOST if not allof the labour intensive VFX is done in India. Still with cheap VFX artists it costs sooo much to make such movies.

That's the problem with innovative technology and new companies. You can't mass produce properly to bring down costs.

You need a halo product like Tesla did with the Roadster and Model S to raise cash and grow your mass production capabilities What are the advantages of electric scooters? Low range at that price should have atleast 150 km range Majority of folks in this thread are in denial on how big they are in Bangalore and giving them a Dead on Arrival stamp. You need to start somewhere. Expecting 150Km range for 60K INR for the first complete competitive version of a bike is exactly why India will be behind the EV bandwagon. I m not talking out of privilege but EV's have a high one time premium to start with. Take any established EV's around the world and you will see the pattern. Once early adopters increase, they will make an affordable one (like the Model 3) later.

Litchi has nothing to do with encephalitis: Director of litchi research centre,113,c51ar6,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/litchi-encephalitis-director-research-centre-1555505-2019-06-25,38,1561460335.0,,FactCheckPolice,Science/Technology," That's exactly what a director of litchi research centre would say. It look like again people are trying to divert the attention from Malnutrution. 

As all reports previously said, a healthy baby eating litchies wouldn't have caused any issue where as a malnutrioned baby eating Litchies can cause this. 


Blame the cause of malnutrition. Blame the lack of medicines that could have treated this immediately. I'll try to explain in simplified terms.

Research (link to the article:https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(17)30035-9/fulltext) has already been conducted in this topic and they have found out that lychee and many other fruits that are not ripe contain 'hypoglycin A' (protoxin) which is not a toxin by itself, but is converted into a toxin inside the human body, which in turn blocks the enzymes necessary for the production of glucose from proteins and fats. 

Glucose is essential for energy production and most importantly powers the brain. 

Human body generally has enough stores of glucose and kick starts the production of glucose from proteins and fats only if these stores are depleted.

These kids either did not receive enough glucose at hospital and/or severely malnourished so they had no glucose stored inside them to start with. With no glucose inside and a toxin blocking your body from converting fats and proteins to glucose leads to a crisis. Even if they did not eat any unripe lychees, the body will break down muscle and organ tissues to restore the glucose stores which is bad too.

 Also you need to eat unripe lychees to ingest the protoxin. Since Muzaffarpur is a lychee growing area, I highly doubt people there are feeding their kids unripe lychees. Even then it only adds oil to the burning fire. 

The real problem is sanitation and hygiene combined with malnutrition. 

Malnutrition fucks up and weakens your immune system which the viruses and bacteria in the unsanitary conditions are just waiting to take advantage off. Litchis aren't the only reason apparently, it's a combination of multiple factors

Our analyses indicate that the absence of an evening meal modified the association between litchi consumption and illness

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(17)30035-9/fulltext First of all it's not encephalitis, but encephalopathy. Big difference.
As a doctor I can tell u that litchi is absolutely fine as long as you are not malnourished or in a state of Ketosis. What happened in Bihar is due the 3 circumstances which have happened before in 2014 as well , whence it was told to the training doctors there then on how to manage it. But as it happens in govt hospitals, these things go out the window faster than Mamta getting out of her car due to chantings. 
1) litchi is grown in Muzzfapur and it's harvest season 
2) kids there doing the harvest are very malnourished due to poverty and usually rely on the main way to keep body glucose normal.
Which is breakdown of stored Fats to glucose and ketone bodies using Fatty Acly CoA Dehydrogenase enzyme.
3) kids who harvest this with thier parents , pick up left over or fallen litchi off the ground and eat them to thier hearts content.

Now, Litchi has Hypoglycin a toxin which inhibits the above mentioned enzyme ,and that was basically the only way the Brain was alive, living off Ketone bodies. With that stopped, when the child goes to sleep,the brain enters Comatose. Hence Encephalopathy.

The Sad part is the treatment is pretty easy if the child makes it to a near by Rural Hospy, just glucose needs to be infused into the blood. But seeing the state of the child the parents rush them to the Tertiary Hospital by which time the brain has been out of any fuel source resulting in permanent damage. 
This disease is also called Jamaican Encephalopathy cuz of the fruits there have similar toxins in them. 
Such fruits don't bother normal healthy ppl since our infusion of glucose is multi-sourced from recent meals and stored liver Glycogen. One one hand we have a multiyear multi institute research collaboration pointing towards unripe litchi as a cause and on the other hand we have this director absolving litchi of the blame. I dont know who to believe ! 

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(17)30035-9/fulltext I mean it is scientifically proven to be associated with encephalitis, so there‚Äôs that ""Bullets have nothing to do with damage.

My thoughts regarding pubg addiction,25,calp5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/calp5r/my_thoughts_regarding_pubg_addiction/,26,1562624767.0,"Guys pls read full comment and then comment if u think I am wrong and feel free to reply


- Who am I?

I am M 18, A pubg player who used to play pubg for like 4 hours a day from season 1 ( A few days after the game was launched ). U may say I was addicted to pubg.

- Do I still play pubg?

Yes I still do play pubg. But not everyday. I play it very less than before. I only play if my friend msg me if we should play pubg at a particular time. If both of us are free at same time and willing to play then we play else no one plays ( or plays for like 10 mins )

- How did I reduce my time spent on pubg?

1. Glitch and bugs like 1 tap glitch and car glitch and lag in general made me feel that I should not play

2. My friends also felt the same. I used to play most games with my friends because I felt playing with random wasn't as much fun. So we all started to play less


- Why do people commit suicide?

Firstly we are notified of serious incidents like suicide / murder but ""pubg"" should have also destroyed many relationships/ friendships

Personally I do not think that pubg alone can lead to such sad incidents.
The person had no one to speak freely with. No one would listen. Maybe peer pressure made him frustrated. Maybe parents instead of helping, taunted the child. Maybe the society made fun of the person. All the saturated anger/depression was the actual reason. Maybe the person thought that the way the escape everyday boring life was playing and playing pubg.

- Is playing online games to take our anger good?

Yes as well as no. You may feel good after you scream at usually random people but you may also feel more frustrated if they all are against you and u aren't so good in game. In such cases it is a very bad choice

- Have I faced similar situation and what did I do?

Yes even I play online games to take out my anger and sometimes get even more angry.
I just quit the game and start watching some anime I like ( sports anime works the best for me ). Going out for playing or short walks or talking with friends or playing with pets should be better options but many times we can't do it. People should find what works best for them and do it and relax


- Are parents responsible for such incidents?

I can't directly say if someone is responsible.
But parents should help the child. 


- My suggestions to parents:

1. Please don't bring the topic about how the current generation is addicted to phones and pubg and u were like üíØ x better. It irratates and makes all of us angry. Because ur generation has ruined every single thing. Most of us don't have land to play. Many are forced to compete for marks even when they aren't ready. Ur generation invented phone. School/College and tuition leave very less time to just chill and enjoy.
2. Talk to children like a friend
3. If you notice significant change then pls ask someone for help",SilverZero0,Science/Technology," [removed] Very rightly said, the parents in my view don't cure the underlining reason of addiction, for them the solution to everything is BAN. I always get annoyed by seeing news site clickbaiting title ""18 yrs old kills brother due to PUBG"" and all the same kind of shit, it's not because of PUBG. Instead of finding out the main cause they blame it on any fads that going on. it was very addicting when I first started out the game and lasted for about 2-3 months.        
but it got very boring for me after that, I couldn't bring myself to open it again. When people talk about PUBG in India, it‚Äôs almost exclusively PUBG Mobile, right? Nicely written. Are you talking about pubg mobile or pubg PC tho ? Hello OP,

Need help and advice regarding my laptop,20,ccltzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccltzg/need_help_and_advice_regarding_my_laptop/,18,1563025380.0,"Gave my laptop for ram upgrade as it came with 4gb ram and eventually got slower so decided it's time for upgrade. Gave the laptop to the shopkeeper from where i bought this laptop in 2015 and then after 2 days he told me that my Hard disk crashed and i have to install the new one. I didn't believed him, took my laptop back and gave him 3200rs for installing the ram and then i formatted the hard disk and after that it started working normally (maybe when it hit bad sectors then i got the black screen error as hard disk(3F0) Boot device not found) but after 3 days the same problem occurred, and this time i decided to buy the ssd and replace the hard disk. So i bought Samsung evo 860 and tried to replace but laptop didn't detected the ssd. This time i went to different shopkeeper and gave it to him and he told me the hard disk connector was damaged and i have to change that and after 2 days he bought the connector and this time he told me that it got short-circuit and there is some other issue. He took 2 week to give me the update and gave me the update that motherboard is having some issues and now i have to replace whole motherboard. I'm totally fucked up and frustrated, what the fuck is going on, either these shopkeepers are doing scam or maybe it's just a coincidence. (Bought this laptop in 2015 for 48k, model is **HP pavilion p15-t001x**), please help and give advice regarding this what should i do, couldn't find the hp official service centre in Mumbai and whether should i really go for replacing the motherboard or buy the new laptop?  [https://i.imgur.com/WQ1ZeJk.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/WQ1ZeJk.jpg)",Humble-Fool,Science/Technology," Which place?

Never ever give your laptop to shopkeeper. If any issue is there, get it done there in front of you. 3200 for ram installation? You should've bought the ram online and install it by yourself or get it installed in front of you. It's just 5 mins work. If you ever submit your laptop, always sign get it opened, sign on the hard disk and the ram. 

They're most probably scamming you, can't say for sure though. Nothing takes two weeks to diagnose a laptop. This is the model I had was a HP Pavilion 15-p027TX
4GB DDR3, 4th gen i3, 1TB 5400rpm HDD, Nvidia 830M. Got it way back in 2013 with Win 8.1 Home (Warranty expired in a year)

The laptop was amazing until Windows 10 showed up. The slowness was quite noticeable. An HDD cannot handle windows 10. 
In 2016, did some research and got a Samsung 750 EVO 2.5ich SSD, 4GB RAM, and a blank 9.5mm Caddy to remove the Optical Drive.
Purchased all the parts online with all the necessary information from the HP manual.
Took it to HP service center, explained the process to the technician of removing the HDD and Optical drive to install the SSD on the Primary HDD slot (6 GB/s SATA speeds) and install the slow HDD in the blank Caddy and connect it to the ODD slot (which has only 1.5 GB/s SATA speeds).  Some keyboard keys were wonky.  Got them cleaned. Everything was installed perfectly. 

The optical drive was removed and the SSD and along with the HDD was detected on BIOS. RAM upgrade was also detected.
Only had to pay labor charges at the service center as I had procured all the parts.  Tipped the tech a little extra for managing the sling in all the parts!
Now my PC was cranked up to 250GB SSD, 1TB HDD, and 8GB RAM. A clean Windows 10 install worked like a charm!


Laptop still works, however, the battery died last year. But still works flawlessly with the power adapter connected. 
Converted the laptop as a Desktop setup so that it stays plugged in and connected an FHD(1080p) Dell monitor to it.
I use it when I visit home. Its been 6 years, works faster and better than most 2019 PCs shipped with an HDD. Life's good!

So yeah, always get any Hardware checks done from the manufacturer service center and do not rely on any 3rd party vendors Visit Hp service centre They're scamming you.

This happened to me in Sony Service Center (in 2013), I had a bit of an auto shut down issue: which escalated from fan replacement (of Rs 6,000/-) to motherboard repair (Rs. 20,000/-). Worst, I had to pay some service charges (about Rs. 300/-) to get my laptop back. 

&#x200B;

Ultimately went to a local service guy who repaired the whole thing for Rs. 1,500/-. 

&#x200B;

The point being that a good honest service guy is super hard to find. I just saw you're in Mumbai. There was a service center located right next to Welcome restaurant in Fort. Roughly here: [https://www.google.com/maps/place/JBL,+Bose,+Pioneer,+Yamaha,+Denon,+Onkyo,+Home+Theatre+Dealers+in+Mumbai,/@18.9311479,72.8319374,21z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x3be7d1c4f08b1c4d:0xf21e551177b3a95e!2sFort,+Mumbai,+Maharashtra!3b1!8m2!3d18.9345189!4d72.8371021!3m4!1s0x3be7d1dcd4f326d1:0x7f5a7ec67e4834d0!8m2!3d18.9310551!4d72.8318889](https://www.google.com/maps/place/JBL,+Bose,+Pioneer,+Yamaha,+Denon,+Onkyo,+Home+Theatre+Dealers+in+Mumbai,/@18.9311479,72.8319374,21z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x3be7d1c4f08b1c4d:0xf21e551177b3a95e!2sFort,+Mumbai,+Maharashtra!3b1!8m2!3d18.9345189!4d72.8371021!3m4!1s0x3be7d1dcd4f326d1:0x7f5a7ec67e4834d0!8m2!3d18.9310551!4d72.8318889)

&#x200B;

It has always been a reliable service center for me. Not sure if its still there. i have a hp laptop too with dead motherboard , can you tell me the approx. cost for changing motherboard .if you tell for your motherboard i could guess it for mine Your laptop was slow because of the hard disks. They're inherently slow. You went for ram upgrade, but it's possible your hard disk was dying. So then you go for a new ssd. It shouldve been detected. I dont know why it wasnt. Then you went again and the shopkeeper, thinking that he can fool you, might have damaged the hdd sata connector. Use toll free and contact the company (afaik there are HP service centres in Mumbai). Most technicians in a computer shop can only click refresh for five times on a windows PC & then proceed to format it or install shady pirated copies of popular software. On hardware side they don't even know how to handle electrostatic sensitive devices like motherboards & ram properly. I have a Micromax Laptab Windows tablet/laptop. One fine day, it wasn't turning on. So, I gave it to a local Micromax service centre and they say they will send it to Delhi to get it repaired or replaced. I just gave them.

Two months later, after a lot of excuses from him, I told him to return my old tablet. He said that the tablet arrived a few days back. Then, I took it and returned home.

After reaching home, the first thing I did was to check if it turns on. Yes, it indeed turned on. But, what I found that there were some pictures of someone stored inside which were taken in the duration of the servicing. Then, I realised that it was the service centre person himself and his family.

I really got furious when I came to know that the tablet's battery went 0% and I just needed to charge it a few more minutes to restore it from being dead.

The service center man was using my device without my permission for 2 months!! üò° And I had to live without that for so long in the hope that it will be fixed very soon. üò≠ If you ever need to get any maintenance work done, take it to an authorised service centre, not some random shopkeeper. Most of these electronic, mobile and laptop repair persons in India are unqualified jokers. Don‚Äôt ever give your electronics to them for repair. Some of these people don‚Äôt even know about basics of electronics let alone being qualified to repair anything.

In your case, you could have replaced the RAM yourself, it takes 10 mins with the right toolkit which are readily available online. If you have to give it to others, make sure you ask people around, read online reviews and decide. 3.2k for the RAM and installation or just the RAM ? And how much did you upgrade it to ?

VU Premium Android 4k TVs aren't really HDR! Please go through this thread before buying one.,84,c2si9u,https://www.hifivision.com/threads/vu-premium-android-4k-tvs-arent-really-hdr-please-go-through-this-thread-before-buying-one.75423/,43,1561040809.0,,NavdeepSinghThind,Science/Technology," What‚Äôs a simple test to conduct from an naive end user perspective to know if my TV is HDR or not? I can explain two points from that email.
1. HDR doesn't require minimum 10 bit panel. 8bit + FRC is widely used by companies for HDR implementation. It's not best but you cannot just say it doesn't support HDR. 

2. Official YouTube app doesn't play HDR videos on any smart TV except with their Chromecast ultra.

To check if TV supports HDR download videos from 4kmedia. org and check or you can open Netflix and look for HDR or Dolby vision signs. 


About 450 nits peak brightness. This is one of the highest peak brightness in budget HDR TV. For comparison mitv has 280 nits and iffalcon has 290 nits of peak brightness. [Relevant](https://veblr.com/watch/341f909e7439/bollywood-comedy-kauwa-biryani-vijay-raaz-bollywood-movie-comedy-scene) Anyone know if this is problem with pixelight as well?

https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8nyono/best_4k_tvs_under_50k/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

But beware support is awful. They support HDR10 content formats but the panels aren't 10-bit. None of the cheap panels are, I'm surprised someone expected otherwise. I'd request you guys to please check this post:

https://www.hifivision.com/threads/vu-launching-4k-tv-with-hdr-and-dolby-vision.74222/post-819712 [deleted] Not sure about vu but Xiaomi claims that their TVs have hdr but the picture quality is total shit, worse than cheap laptops. I have the TV it plays Dolby Vision content. The Dolby Vision logo fires up on Metflix and if I play Dolby Vision content from HDD.

Its has a dolby vision decoder in the libraries.

I dont know what you're expecting but with the right content HDR works just fine.

Also you need to use the native player for Dolby Vision to work, or netflix.

It's an 8 Bit + FRC, most of the 8 bit screens you use including that costly IPS on your monitor is generally a 6Bit + FRC.
Dont see the problem

My 10 bit content plays with significantly less banding compared to an 8 bit display. On some grey to white gradient scenes.

Ask me specific questions I'll answer.

HDR as a moniker is misused, but this TV is quite bright at 450 nits (burns your eyes frankly) and has deep blacks. Not the deepest, I have seen better but very black (comparing to an 80k 1080p Samsung I have). I think this thread is titled very wrongly, correct me if I am wrong. Some advice for life
Half knowledge is very dangerous

I'm not going to quote my credentials

I wrote a post explaing everything but you seem to know everything, so I suppose you can find that information yourself, hence I deleted it.

I have none of the problems you are facing, I know what you are doing wrong with your settings, I know where to get free and legal Dolby Vision content. But you're free to use google and spend a few hours on actually understanding things :)

I know what DV means just more than the catchphrase.

Making such tall claims I thought you probably were a paid mule but it seems you are just ignorant snob.

On a lighter note, it gets better bro, you just have to work on it. A lot of Trials and errors. Absolutely, in fact IT industry is the only one where you at least have the opportunity. But you'll have to get into a product company, preferably a foreign one. Which means you'll have to hone your skills like heck and then try to get into a Google or Microsoft. Even flipkart is ultrachill from what I have heard. 
But you should definitely work on those things, eventually you'll have to stand up for yourself, in life or career A lot of engineers in the company I work for have a reputation of being autistic, which is acceptable and infact celebrated. But like the other commenter said stay away from Indian outsourcing. Those are sometimes customer facing and it might need social skills Hehe. IT is where all those people are. You will be fine.

When i started working fulltime it was for an MNC and boy did i struggle. Not only was it difficult to interact with my managers and colleagues on a daily basis but the company also had (like every other such company) team building activities and outings. And let me tell you your absence is noted.

&#x200B;

I was struggling to just be present and do my work. Good thing it was enough motivation for me to finally seek treatment again and stick with it. I started taking meds and it helped tremendously. 

&#x200B;

If you are not under treatment get help ASAP. Of course. For a person who has accepted social anxiety and low confidence as a part of their life, it'll come in their career progress. However, if the person is working towards the problem , trying a little more every and observing themselves and the world around them deeply, nothing can hinder them.", net_2 platinumgus18 spyrider7 spaceturd4 azemda bishopsandrooks pythonapster Monstrous_moonshine

*It definitely goes wrong.* Behind 16 feet wall? Gonna go ahead and defend this move. Look I don't even keep Google Play services on my phone.

IMEI numbers are not private. There are 3rd party sites with IMEI database that can tell you device specifications along with the carrier info of the phone. 

Its pretty common to share IMEI while trading phones on ebay. 

Fuck, this government can prolly download databases for free online. Will be more complete than whatever they put together. 

IMEI cannot be tracked from your home by some kiddo running Kali Linux with a parabolic antenna.

You wanna track a phone? tell every major telecom company in this country to report if the sim is used on their network.

It can only be done from their Base stations, police could always do it. Nothing much changes.

IMEI blacklist will cut down on stolen devices, you CAN change your IMEI number (illegal, android only) It is not exactly easy & your device still may not work with any network. Won't be only stolen phones that get tracked >:( This is a 2G era stuff being implemented and to be mandated. This ideally should have been done more than a decade ago. Possibility is that some networks relying highly on Chinese low end phones might by pass the 3GPP to earn the ARPU spite of the duplicate IMEI. Data stored behind 5ft thick concrete walls.

https://noshly.com/additive/e508/flavour-enhancer-plus/508/#.XQ8LxUBX7qs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_chloride

Potassium chloride is extracted from minerals¬†sylvite,¬†carnallite, and¬†potash. It is also extracted from¬†salt water¬†and can be manufactured by crystallization from¬†solution,¬†flotation¬†or¬†electrostatic¬†separation from suitable minerals. It is a by-product of the production of¬†nitric acid¬†from¬†potassium nitrate¬†and¬†hydrochloric acid.

The vast majority of potassium chloride is produced as agricultural and industrial grade potash in¬†Saskatchewan, Canada, as well as Russia and Belarus. Saskatchewan alone accounted for over 25% of the world's potash production in 2017.[16] Mineral Salt 508 is Potassium Chloride.

It is used to either thicken the substance or as a flavor enhancer. You can refer to this site for more information :

\> The IISc team observed that at a critical temperature of 160 K (-113.15 degree C) and critical current of little less than 10 milliampere the voltage suddenly shoots up and the gold-silver nanostructures no longer exhibit superconductivity as resistance increases rapidly. A superconductor is one which conducts electricity with zero resistance to the flow of electrons. 

and 

\> Clarifying about the zero voltage Prof. Ghosh said, ‚ÄúAt temperatures slightly below 161.3 K the voltage is zero up to 10 milliampere current. The voltage may increase at higher current, which was not tested. Similar behaviour was observed in metal whiskers where superconductivity is observed at a lower temperature.

Need some career advice or advice for future plans.,20,ccdt2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccdt2p/need_some_career_advice_or_advice_for_future_plans/,5,1562981038.0,"Very sorry for the wall of text. I hope this subreddit is the correct place for this post.

I want some career advice but I have no friends in the relevant fields to ask. I graduated in electrical engineering and learnt absolutely nothing and have no skills to get me a job in electrical field. So I turned to IT and worked there for 1 year and god it was shit. I decided I will never get into IT and get into some product based companies. The issue is I have no education in CS. I quit last year and decided to give GATE-2019 in CS/IT paper to make my way into the computer science fields as I feel I am good at coding and stuff. I got AIR of 5300 in the GATE exam and am trying again for next year. (I'll continue with masters in whichever college I get if I don't get a good score this year too).

So now I'm completely clueless as for what my future plans are. Other than attempting GATE and doing masters. What am I supposed to do next? I feel like I don't have any practical skills to make myself employable. I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites. But I doubt that is enough to get me a job. I am thinking of learning some online courses and learn something other than C. But what should I learn? What do I have to learn to make myself employable? I understand that what I should start learning depends on which job I want to get into. But I can't decide and have no one to consult. I hear some buzzwords like data science and machine learning on the news and online but I don't know if that is right for me.

I thought of getting into the following fields: ML, Data science, Web development, Android development.

But again I have not the slightest idea of any of those. As far as I understand, ML and Data science requires more math and I can't say I'm good at math. With web development, I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding and wonder if it has good job opportunities here in India.

If you know any other good field with good opportunities in India please suggest.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I know that I have a goal. Which is to get a good coding related job. But I don't know how to get to that goal. Nor which technology I should get into. So please help me decide.",sumanthdbz,Science/Technology," While preparing for 2020 , try to understand algorithms and data structures properly i mean give as much as you can. This is important because gate syllabus will cover basic required algorithms which is also essential for coding.

I am not a big coder but try web development it is basic requirement at least that is what i think. Many people said web development is in trend.

If you take X comapny try to prepare for it! There are resources like geeks for geeks that gives what kind of questions are asked for that company . They usually follow a trend. 

I am gonna do Mtech this year and  also just as clueless as you are. \> I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding

&#x200B;

What do you mean by traditional coding? If you think it's all just HTML & CSS, you're mistaken, Web Development over the years has grown by leaps and bounds and front-end engineering is a WHOLE thing by itself :) WebDev is a good place to start, even I really started understanding software systems & design when I started working on my first web development project - it's exciting to see a page display data they way you like it after pulling it from the database.

&#x200B;

\>  I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites.

&#x200B;

I'd say you're off to a pretty good start! Keep working on those Data Structure & Algorithms skills, you will really require them going forward! Especially in big companies, they'll ask you to solve one of those questions on a whiteboard/google doc as interviews.

&#x200B;

\> ML and Data science requires more math 

&#x200B;

You're right about this. Have you given that math a shot though? You may like it, you may not, you could check it out for yourself. A master's degree with an AI/ML specialization would be helpful if you wish to enter this field

&#x200B;

Web Development & Mobile Development have good opportunities I'd say - a lot of software engineering jobs entail familiarity with one of these. There's also DevOps which is mostly infrastructure that you could look into!

&#x200B;

For GATE prep if I'm not mistaken, the focus is on knowing C in and out, right? Like what will print(""%.02f"", 22/7) output as etc? (I maybe wrong) Then focus on doing well in these type of questions and the hackerrank type questions can wait till you're in a good college and prepping for jobs at big/good IT companies (like VMWare, Amazon, Microsoft, etc) [deleted] Are you from a Tier-1 college? If not it's going to be very difficult to get an interview in one of the large product based companies even if you get reasonably good (1700-1900 rating on Codeforces) at competitive programming. Despite being from Elect. Engg. securing 5300 rank in GATE is a good feat. You are already ahead of a significant section of GATE takers. So prepare hard this time and you'll definitely get into a great college. Once this happens, you can devote some time for properly learning AI/ML and other stuff and also guarantee yourself a good job. Since you studied Electrical Engineering and you are interested in software, Why not Embedded software? I think there are Universities that offer Embedded systems on a Mtech level.  I can recommend some courses on Coursera/edx on Embedded systems/ operating systems. I would recommend not to get into these buzzwords early in your career. If you are looking for a long technical career, get your basics right. As the other commenter suggested data structures/ algos. I would suggest operating systems/ Basics of databases/ Networking. Explore as much as possible during your Mtech.  Frankly the place you study matters only for your first job. But having a master's in ""any"" University compared to just having a Bachelor's can help you immensely especially getting a higher starting grade when you start.", RaftelIsMyCity burgundyColor None PlayfulFail spyrider7

I've already posted on r/suggestalaptop but didn't get any response. 

I'm looking for a laptop for video editing and maybe some casual gaming. My budget is capped at ‚Çπ70000. Below is the form I filled on another subreddit.

Before I put the form in here, Laptops in India are hell lot of expensive. What costs around \~$800 in US is sold here at \~$1100 at least. On an average they cost about 40% higher here in India than the US counterpart.   
for instance: Apple MacBook Pro 15"" with 2.6 GHz i7 (9th gen) costs \~$3650 here.

So you get the point.

&#x200B;

Also, AMDs are seen less in Indian market for ""who knows"" what reasons. There are only Ryzen 5 2500U, 3550H and a Ryzen 3. No Ryzen 7.

OK enough. I'm sorry.

&#x200B;

Here is the form:

&#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\*\*  

Not a fan of 2 in 1 form factor, good enough battery life maybe 3-4 hours of real world usage is enough. Best performance for  the money.  I don't want to rush for specs but performance.

&#x200B;

\* \*\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*  

4 on scale of 10

&#x200B;

\* \*\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\*\* 

Linux preferably or Windows.

&#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\*   

anything bigger than 15""  

&#x200B;

\* \*\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\*\*  

Softwares:

Adobe Photoshop CS 6

DaVinci Resolve 16

&#x200B;

Games:

Far Cry 5, COD WW, Forza Horizon 4 and similar games

&#x200B;

\* \*\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\*\*  

No specific games, Far Cry 5, COD WW, Forza Horizon 4 and similar games as I get my hands on them.

&#x200B;

\* \*\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\*\*   

Good Display because video and photo editing work and good enough build.

&#x200B;

\* \*\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\*\* 

Are there companies which offer global warranty or lets you transfer the warranty to other countries? Because I was thinking if I could ask a friend to buy one for me in US and then bring it over here.

&#x200B;

Also, every model isn't available in India.

&#x200B;

Is there any longevity difference between GTX 1660 and GTX 1060. Like which one of them would loose support or something in near future.

You can avail international warranty by purchasing Premium Support Plus or Premium Support when you check out on Dell's website.

Tips to save few bucks:
‚Ä¢ Make a Dell Members account, price will be reduced by around 2%.

‚Ä¢ Is your friend a student? If yes, then you can avail a coupon code for extra 10% off on Dell products by making an account on UNiDAYS. If not then do a jugaad! :-P

‚Ä¢ Purchase through Ebates to get 2% cashback.

If you're sure about it then I would recommend you to order one soon as Black Friday sale is going on Dell USA, prices are already reduced by $120 without applying any coupons.

GTX 1660 is the latest GPU from Nvidia while GTX 1060 is almost 3 years old. Not sure about the support though. Give r/IndianGaming a shot. Look up similar threads before initiating one though,. 1660 replaces 1060 , so i guess there's no point in buying 1060", manchill Chicas_Silcrow texthulk

Suggestions would be appreciated.",SiddharthDot,Science/Technology," Get one of the Vivobooks. If you're not an engineering student, I don't really see you using a laptop that much so don't spend too much on performance. Anything with an i3/4/250+ config can run R, Matlab. Just make sure it has an SSD and as much RAM as you can fit in the budget (atleast 8, ideally 16). You may need to analyze big data-sets which will require serious RAM. Ideally expandable RAM slots (if you can't afford 16 GB right now but not a requirement.).  
     
13-14 inch laptops are better especially if you need to travel a lot, see if they are available in your budget. If not go for 15.6"", not bigger than this.       
Stay away from Macs, and flashy add-ons like touchscreen, flippable etc., they are pointless and you will never use them. Stick to well known brands like Asus, Acer, Dell, HP, etc. and you will be completely fine.      
Screen should be bright enough - this is one of the most important things as it will define your experience - see user reviews for this. Don't think too much - at the end of the day it matters very little what laptop you have as long as it gets the job done.

Why I left JioGigafiber?

I got the Jio GigaFiber after giving into the hype of Refundable Deposit & Free High Speed Internet Services until the services are made public. After a week, I started facing issues in the services mainly pertaining to Internet Speed which was not stable, it  used to fluctuate between 15-65 Mbps with 2-3 days of very slow & unstable internet almost every week, which sounds decent for a free trial subscription but is not worth replacing main internet connection service. Anyway, after complaining about it to the Jio Team and asking for the Refundable deposit back, it‚Äôs been over 45 days - which is the stipulated time to receive my money back, I have not yet got a single penny and so I decided to use the FTTH router.",depressinister,Science/Technology, DDWRT/OpenWRT (flash at your own risk) You can't I think check the contract you signed for JioFiber., YeOkM8 Oxeam3

Imagine the harmful effects of climate change, when the ice melt, Bangladesh will drowned and they will migrate to India. Unfortunately Bangladesh has more population than Russia.  At that time South Asia will become hell. I have just given up. I‚Äôm still doing my part, not using plastic as much as possible, not using vehicles too much and all those steps. But the world is fucked and the best thing I can do for my future kids is not to give birth to them. I don‚Äôt wanna put them through the horrors of the future. That's a lotta damage While I'm not one to dispute climate change, that amount seems ridiculously small.

Remember that the melt water from the glaciers feed 4 major river systems in the subcontinent. Imagine the amount of water that flows under a bridge of any of the rivers in a minute, and now look at that tiny globe of water. 

It doesn't really put anything into context. In Copenhagen I was at an art installation where the artist has placed a huge chunks of arctic ice in the main square, that slowly melted. That's a lot less than I expected. What is the science behind this? also it would be interesting to know how this compares to say 50 years ago. Wait a minute: we need to have ""a lot"" of water coming off of the glaciers, or India would have no rivers except during monsoons, and most people would die.  Yes, climate change is a big problem, but some/much/most of the seasonal melting of Himalayan glaciers is ""normal"" and is crucial to the survival of roughly 2 billion people (not only in India).  The worst part of the climate crisis for India (and its neighbors) is that once those glaciers are gone, the melt water *won't* be coming off of the glaciers.

Automation In Our Society,11,c8d03b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c8d03b/automation_in_our_society/,7,1562121722.0,"
One word has become synonymous with the current economy and job market, that's automation. Automation has been happening all around us for years, but the pace of it has increased substantially in recent times. We are staring at highly automated work environments where the need for people has become inefficient, automation has crept up slowly across industries and has become a major threat to future economies of countries. The problem is, that there hasn't been a concrete solution, no one seems to be agreeing on what could be the solution to this. 


Automation, in manufacturing industry has been constantly increasing, the coveted assembly line model by Henry Ford that streamlined the manufacturing process by making it efficient has in these modern times been a reason for automation to take over jobs. A decade or two ago you could see people working in assembly line, but now if you go to any manufacturing plant there is a high chance that you'll be seeing people only doing quality inspection on the assembly lines instead of doing any assembly, that's because all of it is being done by Robots that have gotten so efficient and cost effective in the long run that there is no reason to have people assembling it. 


Look at the IT sector for an example a decade ago when you dialled a customer support of a company there would be people picking up your phone and addressing you concern or complaints but now when you call customer support of a company, it's a jumbled mess of pre recorded options that you press, if you are lucky and have pressed the right options for a couple of times you might get lucky and actually have a person who might address your problem. Now think about both of these examples, the expertise required for assembling has been replaced by inspection of assembled stuff, which requires much less technical knowledge and experience. Same goes for the IT sector, now a couple of hundred of people can handle a country's customer support because of pre recorded options. This has obviously helped in increasing productivity in both industries and has made it easier and efficient process.


There have been people who have dismissed the buzz words of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning), but software tools powered by AI and ML have been able to make a dent in management industry as well. For some time automation has only affected the workers or the labour intensive tasks, but AI powered software has made many management position redundant. In the service industry, you can already see bigger retailers, either going online or having less and less number of people employed in their stores, with the high penetration of internet, now payments have become increasingly cashless and you can see stores with self checkout counters in the west. You shouldnt be surprised if in the future you enter a mall early morning to get your groceries and you end up being the only person in the whole mall, since every task now has been automated. 


The major industry that is yet to be affected by this onslaught of automation has been driving, the goods carriers, the taxi drivers and truck drivers, the delivery guy who delivers your Amazon orders or the Swiggy guy who delivers you your food. There is a big chance that over the decade you might see all of them disappear, with self driving cars and trucks, drone delivery for goods becoming a reality, the industry will move quickly and make all of these automated. Atleast, now you can take that extra nap you need in your self driving car when you head out to work or eat your breakfast in it. 


Imagining all of this, must give people a sense of comfort, on how the future will be becoming more convenient, but the fact is that it would come at cost of hundreds of thousands of jobs. While, it is true that newer jobs will be created, there is no doubt that it will never be as many as automation will be replacing. There have been solutions to these suggested such as robot tax which is taxing a company more for more automation, or solutions such as Universal Basic Income which addresses the post automation world where jobs are less and people need to be subsidised for living. While not working does seem like an absurd option, maybe it actually isn't, hobbies can become lifestyle choices, more people can go into sports, with the space exploration in the horizon maybe we can go back to exploration, while this will obviously guarantee that capitalism will make the balance of society uneven where we will have the ultra rich that will have majority of the wealth distributed among a single percent of the population, it will be the job of the future governments, economists and leaders to address these problems.

Note: I made a post about content writing and got a bit of PMs regarding samples, so I just made a Reddit post about it. I'd appreciate your advice and suggestions.

Edit: Paragraphed",rohanpaul,Science/Technology," I did not feel like reading this. Paragraphs are too big, and it sounds more like an exposition than something you'd expect somebody to read. I would probably listen to this as a speech, but it doesn't spark interest in the written form. 

Try reading Slate Star Codex. If you can replicate Scott's writing style, you'll become a tremendous content writer.

PS: Just my two cents. I don't think I can write better than you can Recently read an article on The Economist that there is boom in the job market across the rich world in spite of all the automation. Because of the increase in pace, people believe more in [myths of AI](https://medium.com/@techindustan/myths-of-artificial-intelligence-1166cce89215) then facts. you seem to have a the opinion that the proliferation AI will propel automation to new heights, a net positive for the society, providing the basis of a utopian society where men shall be free from work.

Are you right here, that an artificially intelligent machine may actually help humanity, if we realize that our society is not only one, but many, but we also have to give due space to all of the different viewpoints to which we may be exposed, such as men, women and minorities among others.

But to the extent that you can give space to all the viewpoints that we would rather not be exposed to, as we are now, then we can be comfortable in this technological era in the long term with the possibility to overcome the challenges presented to us in the realm of science.

For the sake of humanity, is there any way that we can help to create a future where this process of AI is fully integrated into the daily lives of all society and in which men can be free from work and be in complete peace of mind with not having to worry about anything about their safety, because of a future AI that is programmed perfectly to eliminate the fear of work, and create a society where men can leave work without fear of injury due to technology as the reality of their day is made up out of machines.

But imagine if things that we consider to be innately human, a fruit of the brain like content creation to be done completely by machines running on AI, are the safety nets there for the poor can rely on to earn his bread?", progdoesntlikeyou kamak10 technewsninja frostydrizzle

Parents put a lot of pressure on kids to succeed and then when the child isn‚Äôt able to match up. A dude from my college committed suicide because he got detained for low attendance TBH it's not their fault, it has more to do with parents screwing over their kids. The problem is people dont take this thing seriously. Atleast one lecture in a month on mental heath awreness can do wonders. Seriously what do you expect. A huge number of students pass the intermediate every year and are thrown into a sea of uncertainty. They are provided only two or three options of higher studies. They are forced to follow the trends. Add to this a political environment where a cow is given more importance then education and employment. 

India has the highest percentage of youth population anywhere in the world. But the lack of opportunities and a lackluster quality of education affects the mind of the student population.
Apart from medical, engineering and civil services every other trade is considered alternative career options. It is time that we realise that our education system is broken and improve upon it. Parents put a lot of pressure on their kids. But, well what are they supposed to do? They want the best for their kids and education seems to be the safest and most predictable way to get a good life. We are not in the US where being a carpenter or plumber makes you good money. Starting a business is risky and there is no predictable plan to be successful at it.

I honestly think the root of the issue is overpopulation. We simply do not have enough resources/opportunities for people to have a good life.
I believe something akin to China's one child policy should be enforced. I know this sounds extreme but I think this is the solution to many of the problems India faces. man i see Jontron

We still lack proper infrastructure for 4g. If the history is to be our mentor, then I believe very soon.  
Telecom Cos will just rebrand their existing 4G as 5G and market this gimmick to the vast majority of technically backward mass of our country. Very soon ""India's largest 5G Network"" is going to be a slogan you'll find everywhere. Meanwhile Speeds would be limited to just 10 mbps at the most on a good day. Doubt it, most will not buy a new mobile again only for 5g. May be they will soft launch now and go aggressive after 2 years Hopefully not soon. It has horrible wall / object penetration, it will put our weather forecast like it was 40 years back, all the ""standards"" is not standardized.

Opinion, Its mostly buzz words to get more money from consumers so far. No need. First improve current communication infrastructure. you should ask this to Mukesh Ambani and he's not planning to launch till 2024 5g is supposed to connect the IOT. We're gonna need a fucking robust infrastructure for it, this half assed sloppy shit like 4g was won't work.

If they're going to build it, then they have to build it exactly as it's supposed to be; super low latency for multiple devices connected at once, the download speed is supposed to be multiple times higher than 4g. Our 4g is slower than Singapore's 3g.

We simply don't want 5g if they can't deliver it like that. Around mid 2020 to early 2021. My dad's BSNL's 4G doesnt even work out of our home city ( I know it's weird but it really does happens , the 4G doesn't works out of our city )  so basically would love that to be fixed first.

Rahul Gandhi resigns as President of Congress,1120,c8lydy,https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/i-am-no-longer-congress-president-affirms-rahul-gandhi20190703143743/,413,1562174603.0,,GA3RU,Politics," This just might be the best thing to happen to Congress off late. And to Rahul Gandhi too. About time! No matter one's views, India deserves a strong  opposition. 

I'm not sure who should succeed him, but it should be a non-Gandhi who has done good work in their state and is preferably younger. Someone like Sachin Pilot? Here's the full resignation letter from Rahul Gandhi. 


>It is an honour for me to serve the Congress Party, whose values and ideals have served as the lifeblood of our beautiful nation. I owe the country and my organisation a debt of tremendous gratitude and love.

>As President of the Congress Party, I am responsible for the loss of the 2019 election. Accountability is critical for the future growth of our party. It is for this reason that I have resigned as Congress President.

>Rebuilding the party requires hard decisions and numerous people will have to be made accountable for the failure of 2019. It would be unjust to hold others accountable but ignore my own responsibility as President of the party.

>Many of my colleagues suggested that I nominate the next Congress President. While it is important for someone new to lead our party, it would not be correct for me to select that person. Ours is a party with a profound history and heritage, one of struggle and dignity that I deeply respect. It is woven into the fabric of India and I trust the party will make the best decision regarding who can lead us with courage, love and fidelity.

>Immediately after resigning, I suggested to my colleagues in the Congress Working Committee that the way forward would be to entrust a group of people with the task of beginning the search for a new President. I have empowered them to do so and committed my full support to this process and a smooth transition.

>My fight has never been a simple battle for political power. I have no hatred or anger towards the¬†BJP¬†but every living cell in my body instinctively resists their idea of India. This resistance arises because my being is permeated with an Indian idea that is and has always been in direct conflict with theirs. This is not a new battle; it has been waged on our soil for thousands of years. Where they see differences, I see similarity. Where they see hatred, I see love. What they fear, I embrace.

>This compassionate idea permeates the hearts of millions and millions of my beloved fellow citizens. It is this idea of India that we will now vehemently defend.

>The attack on our country and our cherished Constitution that is taking place is designed to destroy the fabric of our nation. In no way, shape or form am I stepping back from this fight. I am a loyal soldier of the Congress party and a devoted son of India and will continue to serve and protect her till my last breath.


>We fought a strong and dignified election. Our campaign was one of brotherhood, tolerance and respect for all of India‚Äôs people, religions and communities. I personally fought the Prime Minister, the RSS and the institutions they have captured with all my being. I fought because I love India. And I fought to defend the ideals India was built upon. At times, stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it. I have learned so much from the spirit and dedication of our workers and party members, men and women who have taught me about love and decency.

>A free and fair election requires the neutrality of a country‚Äôs institutions; an election cannot be fair without arbiters ‚Äì a free press, an independent judiciary, and a transparent election commission that is objective and neutral. Nor can an election be free if one party has a complete monopoly on financial resources.

>We didn‚Äôt fight a political party in the 2019 election. Rather, we fought the entire machinery of the Indian state, every institution of which was marshalled against the opposition. It is now crystal clear that our once cherished institutional neutrality no longer exists in India.

>The stated objectives of the RSS, the capture of our country‚Äôs institutional structure, is now complete. Our democracy has been fundamentally weakened. There is a real danger that from now on, elections will go from being a determinant of India‚Äôs future to a mere ritual.

>This capture of power will result in unimaginable levels of violence and pain for India. Farmers, unemployed youngsters, women, tribals, Dalits and minorities are going to suffer the most. The impact on our economy and nation‚Äôs reputation will be devastating. The Prime Minister‚Äôs win does not negate the breadth of corruption allegations against him; no amount of money and propaganda can ever hide the light of the truth.

>The Indian nation must unite to reclaim and resuscitate our institutions. The instrument of this resuscitation will be the Congress party.

>To achieve this important task, the Congress Party must radically transform itself. Today the BJP is systematically crushing the voice of the Indian people. It is the duty of the Congress Party to defend these voices. India has never and will never be one voice. It is and always will be a symphony of voices. That is the true essence of Bharat Mata.


>Thank you to the thousands of Indians, both at home and abroad, who have sent me letters and messages of support. I will, of course, continue to fight for the ideals of the Congress Party with all my strength. I am available to the party whenever they require my services, input or advice. To those who support the Congress ideology, especially our dedicated and beloved karyakarta, I have absolute faith in our future and the utmost love for you. It is a habit in India that the powerful cling to power, no one sacrifices power. But we will not defeat our opponents without sacrificing the desire for power and fighting a deeper ideological battle. I was born a Congressman, this party has always been with me and is my life‚Äôs blood and forever that way it shall remain.

>Jai Hind. Lol. Party members are actually asking him to stay. ""After ages, I am free!"" Dibs on the seat. Have not been following Indian news much since the elections. Who could the next leader of the INC be? If he had done this before, they could have diluted the dynasty tag, at least in the literal sense. But Modi vs WHO? WHO ? WHO ?....now in Arnab's studio when he asks this question only sound will be ...crickets! Well if a male Gandhi heir resigns from politics it should be an indicator of a grim and dark future.

For the crime punish the man with jail and fines as per the law. However ordering the distribution of a religious material undermines the secular status of the court. Religion is cancer. That punishment must be in law books then. Why do people keep social media accounts with real name? Anyone with political clout can get you arrested for anything you post on social media or direct lynch mob at you. Hey! She if refusing to do that. Any legal minds, what can the courts do then? This is absurd on so many levels. These sort of decisions should be condemned or overturned by higher courts, otherwise it'll be a bar precedent! she had only shared someone's else's post on her wall. 

if just sharing posts is now a crime under Indian law, or retweeting is crime, then I can't respect that kind of law. What was the message?

People can form groups and attack anybody they want and nobody gets punished. It's weird that the more religious extremism is increasing in this country, the more i want to disassociate myself from my religion or any religion fir that matter.

Like for me, it's unsettling to chant jai sri ram when i know that there are people who have killed someone for not saying these 3 words. The failure of the local law enforcement is really infuriating. What took them so long?

As a Hindu, I am ashamed that these criminals call themselves ""Hindu"". These guys are just plain murderers and criminals. Hang 'em all. India is a banana state masquerading as a democracy. Even if those guys are arrested , they will be out in 6 months after media spotlight is away from it. Will India end up being the 1994 Rwanda? Many things happening now in India are eerily similar to what happened in Rwanda in the run up to the genocide! ""Jai Shri Ram"" is a prayer to Ram Madhav AFAIK, not to Ramayan Ram. /s Hey sorry - I tried looking it up but I couldn‚Äôt find anything. Can someone please explain? It seems that people in India has acquired a bit more extremism and violence, which is evident from the getting highly mandate second time of the pro-Hiduism party. The party head is responsible for the massacre of innocent people in Gujrat. Recently, the court set free terrorists who openly accepted the bomb blast plan on Samjhota express. Still people give mandate to same party. What is the solution? well, the mentally has to be changed. We have to accept all faith to be real secular country. We need to play our role in ground level, we need to stop such mob by doing these kind of activities, instead of recording the event. Jump into the mob, save the person until your last moment of life. That is what make a human actually a Human. These incompetent goons remind me of *Mooh me Ram, bagal Me Choori* When right wing powers take over they provide authority in hands of people using discrimination and faith or fake nationalism, And this does not stop until something massive happens, Which is highly unlikely keeping in mind there's a deep rooted system in place to keep these in place ( Read: IT cell, Yellow Journalism) , But history shows fascism never was tolerated for long, and it will have an abrupt ending too. These people who are responsible for his death were always a part of the society, It's not like they're suddenly out of their cave since last 5-6 years, The difference is now they know they will have people to protect them.

For all those who pay taxes, even if they are provided with post-retirement security and health care they will honestly start paying taxes. 

Problem in India is that their no incentive of paying tax. Tax payer and non tax payer have same rights and privileges. 45% income tax. As much as some of the most heavily taxed western European nations with no amenities, no sign of where the money is going and no concessions in education, healthcare, anything whatsoever. Impossible to question where the money is going and all you have to do is be quiet and take it in. 

This country is going to be destroyed from the inside out and if you think anything differently, be prepared to go down with it If you include our extremely high GST and huge tax on fuel, how much tax are you actually paying if you are ""super rich""? 60%? And we are worried about 'brain drain' at the same time! Super rich - 45% income tax. Suddenly you will see Ambani's net income go to Rs. 2 lac per annum, and rest of Rs. 10,000 Cr. income is just ""long term adjusted equity pro-rated dividends"" which are not taxable hee hee.. The rich didn't get rich by paying taxes man, this is just some bullshit political propaganda to fool the masses which will be flushed down the toilet by Ambani and gang within a day. Middle class =/= middle income. The 'middle class' is roughly the richest 5-10% of the country. The vast majority of the country (I'd wager ~95%) does not fall into the tax brackets.

This leaflet depicts Bose, backed up by Japanese tanks, cutting the head off a British lion that was feasting on Indian bones. The text in Hindi, Bengali and Urdu is:

>Subhas Bose has beheaded British Lion

>Hail! Subhas Bose Hail!

[As right-wing BJP seeks to appropriate Bose, a reminder: Congress expelled him for being too left:
Staunchly non-sectarian and left wing, Subhas Chandra Bose was suspended for proposing a radical anti-British movement which was opposed by the Congress‚Äô right wing in 1939.](https://scroll.in/article/802593/as-right-wing-bjp-seeks-to-appropriate-bose-a-reminder-congress-expelled-him-for-being-too-left) - from scroll.in, got this from a reverse image google search. Bose remembers. Who is going to share the Japanese poster where an Indian in dhoti and other asians sit on a globe sharing a pint, celebrating the British guy falling off? Bose is causing a minor headache to an American congresswoman.  Alexandira Ocasio-Cortez‚Äôs chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti was seen wearing a Bose t-shirt recently.  Bose is seen as a Nazi collaborator in many circles. The article just alludes to the controversy over Subhas Chandra Bose's death. What's the most accepted conspiracy theory on it? A little unrelated but if anyone wants to know why Gandhi (i.e. non-violence) makes more sense than Bose in fighting a much more powerful regime, read this amazing comment i came across some days ago. This is about Osama's campaign on America and the 9/11. 

&#x200B;

No. Please stop upvoting this a-historical drivel.

Islamic terrorists (specifically, Al Qaeda, which carried out the 9/11 attacks) were not aiming to ""cripple"" the United States. They didn't attack us because they hate our freedoms or want to change the way we conduct our own business. This is a fantastically amero-centric view and is plainly incorrect.

If you want to know why the United States was attacked, Osama Bin Laden was a fairly prolific writer, and has happily stated his goals, both before and after the attack. I'm now going to copy and paste in a comment posted on reddit a long time ago that covers this very accurately, by quoting him directly:

Technically, Osama bin laden himself stated 9/11 was to wake up the american people, commit an act so harsh towards actual Americans that they would ask ""why me?"" and research the situation. Eventually finding out that they had been attacked because of their countries foreign policy in the middle east. Removing American military bases from Saudi Arabia and cutting off support to regimes like Israel.

This as we know, did not happen. Most Americans didn't even bother to ask why it happened and just assumed it was all about religion and backed retaliation. Americas presence is bigger than it ever was in the middle east, and Israel still gets funded billions in military aid.

The Terrorists have not won. Their goal wasn't for you to get patted down in an airport ffs. The goal wasn't even to ""terrorise"" you into living in constant fear where the word terrorist comes from. Their goal was to get you to rise up against your own government to make sure this never happened again.

So no, the terrorists lost, the american people lost, the only winner is the actual US government who got more control, both over it's own people and the people of the middle east.

This whole ""The terrorist won"" talk every time the government crosses the line cheapens the actual complexity of the situation, and proves that people have no idea what the fuck went on and why in the first place.

Edit: For those interested here are some Osama Bin Laden quotes after 9/11. Stating his goals and his reasons. These are all in his videos that he released, but the American media cherry picked just the quotes that promised another attack, rather than the reason behind them. He even moans of this.

Osama mocking Bushes 'They attack us because they are jealous of our freedom' line: ""Before I begin, I say to you that security is an indispensable pillar of human life and that free men do not forfeit their security, contrary to Bush's claim that we hate freedom. If so, then let him explain to us why we don't strike for example - Sweden? And we know that freedom-haters don't possess defiant spirits like those of the 19 hijackers. No, we fight because we are free men who don't sleep under oppression. We want to restore freedom to our nation, just as you lay waste to our nation. "" - Osama Bin Laden.

Again reaffirming that 911 was get the Americans to question its route cause:

""No one except a dumb thief plays with the security of others and then makes himself believe he will be secure. Whereas thinking people, when disaster strikes, make it their priority to look for its causes, in order to prevent it happening again."" - Osama Bin Laden

Osama getting pissed that the majority of Americans are still ignorant about the reasons, stating he is ""amazed at you"":

""But I am amazed at you. Even though we are in the fourth year after the events of September 11th, Bush is still engaged in distortion, deception and hiding from you the real causes. And thus, the reasons are still there for a repeat of what occurred."" -

Osama Bin Laden

Probably the most insightful statement into Osamas psyche, is the reason he became an anti-American terrorist in the first place.

""I say to you, God knows that it had never occurred to us to strike the towers. But after it became unbearable and we witnessed the oppression and tyranny of the American/Israeli coalition against our people in Palestine and Lebanon, it came to my mind. The events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when America permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon and the American Sixth Fleet helped them in that. This bombardment began and many were killed and injured and others were terrorised and displaced. I couldn't forget those moving scenes, blood and severed limbs, women and children sprawled everywhere. Houses destroyed along with their occupants and high rises demolished over their residents, rockets raining down on our home without mercy. The situation was like a crocodile meeting a helpless child, powerless except for his screams. Does the crocodile understand a conversation that doesn't include a weapon? And the whole world saw and heard but it didn't respond. In those difficult moments many hard-to-describe ideas bubbled in my soul, but in the end they produced an intense feeling of rejection of tyranny, and gave birth to a strong resolve to punish the oppressors. And as I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children. And that day, it was confirmed to me that oppression and the intentional killing of innocent women and children is a deliberate American policy. Destruction is freedom and democracy, while resistance is terrorism and intolerance."" - Osama Bin Laden.

His acceptance as 'the villian' so to speak, his acceptance of being labelled a terrorist:

""So with these images and their like as their background, the events of September 11th came as a reply to those great wrongs, should a man be blamed for defending his sanctuary? Is defending oneself and punishing the aggressor in kind, objectionable terrorism? If it is such, then it is unavoidable for us."" - Osama Bin Laden

In response to Bush invading Afghanistan and now Iraq, Osama while explaining what happened to the soviets says he'll retaliate by bankrupting America

""So we are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy. Rather, the policy of the White House that demands the opening of war fronts to keep busy their various corporations - whether they be working in the field of arms or oil or reconstruction - has helped al-Qaida to achieve these enormous results."" - Osama Bin Laden, 2004

Explaining to the American people that they are the real losers:

""...but on the other hand, it shows that the Bush administration has also gained, something of which anyone who looks at the size of the contracts acquired by the shady Bush administration-linked mega-corporations, like Halliburton and its kind, will be convinced. And it all shows that the real loser is ... you."" - Osama Bin Laden

Rambling about Americas dealing in the middle east again as the reason 'your allies in palestine' is Israel:

""Be aware that it is the nation who punishes the weak man when he causes the killing of one of its citizens for money, while letting the powerful one get off, when he causes the killing of more than 1000 of its sons, also for money. And the same goes for your allies in Palestine. They terrorise the women and children, and kill and capture the men as they lie sleeping with their families on the mattresses, that you may recall that for every action, there is a reaction."" - Osama Bin Laden

Again reaffirms that he wants the American people to hold the government responsible for their policy in the middle east, directly linking it to 911.

""Among the most important of what I read in them was some prose in their gestures before the collapse, where they say: ""How mistaken we were to have allowed the White House to implement its aggressive foreign policies against the weak without supervision."" It is as if they were telling you, the people of America: ""Hold to account those who have caused us to be killed, and happy is he who learns from others' mistakes."" And among that which I read in their gestures is a verse of poetry. ""Injustice chases its people, and how unhealthy the bed of tyranny."" As has been said: ""An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure."""" - Osama Bin Laden.

And a very simple warning from him:

""In conclusion, I tell you in truth, that your security is not in the hands of Kerry, nor Bush, nor al-Qaida. No. Your security is in your own hands."" - Osama Bin Laden But people only worship gandhi and nehru on global level, poor guys bose and bhagat Singh /r/PropagandaPosters Tintin!!! did SCB ever fight alongside the INA or was he always off somewhere else like germany and singapore?

There are definitely much more people trying to get into Bollywood than get out. So this will soon be forgotten. Plus we don't know what kind of pressures she is facing from her own community, so shouldn't judge. As long as she doesn't push her views on other actresses she has every right to follow her faith as she sees fit. Wtf. Such wasted potential just because of an age old religion.

~~Anyway, it's her choice. Let's respect that.~~

Edit : Read more about what she has faced all these years. Trolling from Kashmiri Muslims and maybe some religious pressure too. I don't think it's her choice. She was getting any roles in Movie though? Tbh if you're religious, the film industry is the worst industry to be in Does any one remembers the incident after Dangal, then CM Mehbooba Mufti wanted her to be role model.

But she received severe backlash and criticism from conservatives and Zaira had to apologize for that.

Similarly a girl band had to be stopped earlier.

"On July 31, the final list of Assam‚Äôs National Register of Citizens will be published. Close to 42 lakh residents of Assam will find out whether the state considers them Indian citizens.Those who do not make it to the final list may end up being indefinitely detained in detention centres.",148,cdfqzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdfqzk/on_july_31_the_final_list_of_assams_national/,79,1563215059.0,"# Background

The first National Register of Citizens was compiled in 1951, after the Census was completed that year. Since 2015, the state has been in the process of updating the 1951 register. One of the stated aims of the exercise is to identify so-called ‚Äúillegal immigrants‚Äù in the state, many of whom are believed to have poured into Assam after the Bangladesh War of 1971. [1]

In 1979, about eight years after the war, the state saw an anti-foreigners‚Äô agitation. Assamese ethnic nationalists claimed illegal immigrants had entered electoral rolls and were taking away the right of communities defined as indigenous to determine their political future. [1]

In 1985, the anti-foreigners‚Äô agitation led by the All Assam Students‚Äô Union came to an end with the signing of the Assam Accord. Under this accord, those who entered the state between 1966 and 1971 would be deleted from the electoral rolls and lose their voting rights for 10 years, after which their names would be restored to the rolls. Those who entered on or after March 25, 1971, the eve of the Bangladesh War, would be declared foreigners and deported. [1]

The National Register of Citizens now takes its definition of illegal immigrants from the [Assam Accord](https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/98564/1/appendix.pdf) ‚Äì anyone who cannot prove that they or their ancestors entered the country before the midnight of March 24, 1971, would be declared a foreigner and face deportation. [1]

# Eligibility Criteria [2]

* People whose names appear on the 1951 NRC.
* People whose names appear on any voter list in Assam up to March 24 midnight, 1971.
* Descendants of the above.
* People who came from Bangladesh between January 1, 1966, and March 24, 1971, registered themselves with the Foreigner Regional Registration Office and were declared by the Foreigner Tribunal as Indian citizens.
* All Indian citizens including their descendants who moved to Assam after March 24, 1971. (They need to furnish proof of residence in another part of the country as on March 24, 1971.)
* [People who can provide any among a slew of other admissible documents.](https://imgur.com/nfap9ZH.png)


# Exclusions

Of the 3.29 crore people who applied, 2.89 crore people made it to the draft published on July 30, 2018. But over 40.7 lakh were excluded, including [army veterans](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/nrc-veteran-who-served-30-yrs-in-indian-army-excluded-from-citizen-list-118080200091_1.html), [government employees](https://www.firstpost.com/videos/india/of-no-fixed-abode-ex-govt-employee-in-a-fix-as-assam-nrc-leaves-him-out-includes-wife-and-daughter-5020441.html), [families of former presidents](https://scroll.in/article/888735/why-relatives-of-former-president-fakhruddin-ali-ahmed-are-not-on-assams-final-nrc-draft) and [Assam‚Äôs only woman chief minister](https://scroll.in/latest/889159/assams-lone-woman-chief-minister-not-included-in-final-draft-of-national-register-of-citizens). There is no official community-wise or district-wise data. But anecdotal evidence suggests Bengali-origin communities wee overwhelmingly affected. All those left out of the draft were told to make fresh claims to citizenship.[1]

**Over the past year, the NRC officials also accepted objection forms which allowed people to flag the inclusion of ‚Äúineligible persons‚Äù in the register. On June 26, 1.02 lakh applicants who had made it to the first draft were told they had been included erroneously. They also have prove citizenship all over again.** [1]

[Members of the All Assam Students‚Äô Union have filed lakhs of indiscriminate objections on the inclusion of names that sound Bengali Muslim in the final NRC draft.](https://thewire.in/rights/assam-nrc-bengal-muslims-objections)

Over the next month, Scroll.in will bring you a series called **[The Final Count](https://scroll.in/topic/56205/the-final-count)**. It will tell the stories of those being counted in Assam, the anxieties triggered by the process, the vagaries of the state as it compiled the National Register of Citizens, the complex historical forces which brought it into being.

# What happens if your name isn't in the NRC?

Those who do not make it to the final list will have to appear before the Foreigners‚Äô Tribunals of Assam. These quasi-judicial bodies were originally set up under the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act of 1983. The law has since been struck down by the court but the tribunals persist, tasked with determining whether individuals being tried are foreigners and should be deported.[1]

# What happens if you lose your case in the foreigner's tribunal

Given that no repatriation treaty exists with Bangladesh, no one knows. They may be detained indefinitely in one of the [detention centres that Assam is building.](https://scroll.in/article/887351/assam-has-received-sanction-from-centre-to-build-a-detention-camp-for-foreigners)

# What Next?

* [BJP promised to extend NRC to every state in India in their election manifesto.](https://indianexpress.com/elections/bjp-election-manifesto-national-register-of-citizens-5664960/)
* [BJP MP Tejasvi Surya urges Centre to extend NRC to Karnataka](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bjp-mp-tejasvi-surya-urges-centre-to-extend-nrc-to-karnataka-5823753/)

If Assam is any indication, over a billion people will be required to submit proof of their own identity as well as records to substantiate several generations of family history. And this will be done in a country where the state does not reach many of those who live within its borders, where many fall through the cracks of institutional records, where the story of a life and a generation is contained in local memory and personal relationships rather than in documents.[1]

# Role of Supreme Court [3]

[ Read about the multiple procedural irregularities that have characterised the Supreme Court‚Äôs NRC Case: the use of sealed covers, consequential decisions being taken in closed-door hearings, and the bench‚Äôs disturbing disregard for due process rights. In the course of this years-long proceeding, the Court has far exceeded its brief as the apex judicial organ of the country, with its repeated stress on deportations making it appear more executive-minded even than the executive: more the Supreme Deportation Authority rather than the sentinel on the qui vive. \[3\] ](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/in-the-court-of-last-resort/article25105456.ece)

The government set out a plan where detainees who had spent more than five years in detention centres were to be conditionally released. The conditions of release are so onerous that in my view, they rise to the level of being unconstitutional, but let us ignore that for the moment. The Court refused to accept this proposal as, in the opinion of the CJI, it amounted to sanctioning an ‚Äúillegality‚Äù. [3]

There is no ‚Äì no ‚Äì law that authorises indefinite detention of an individual, whether citizen or foreigner. And if there was a law that did so, it would almost certainly be struck down as unconstitutional. On what basis, therefore, does the Court say that releasing detainees who have spent more than five years in detention would be endorsing an illegality? [3]

So, concentration camps? The Right loves America so much that they cannot help copy them as they [do](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/13/20692931/mike-pence-immigrant-detention-center-mcallen-texas) evil fascist stuff. I will just leave this here.

https://i.redd.it/l84fwt7jaaa31.jpg Let me put my viewpoint here and ask that this be viewed not from the prism of BJP versus Congress because the Assam Accord that was signed was done during Rajiv Gandhi's time and the BJP only did what was their obligation in the last 5 years after the SC forced the centre to fulfill its part of the bargain.

If the centre tries to trick the Assamese people (not the residents of Assam but the actual Assamese) then it'll be playing with fire. If we restart the anti foreigner violence then that will soon inflame the entire North East and we'll slip back into the horrors of the eighties when there were insurgencies in the North, West and eastern extremities of the country. It is with great effort that the state has managed to stop the Punjab insurgency and pacify the North East so that there's only the Kashmir problem left. Just as a gory reminder I'll ask you to read the story of the Nellie Massacre where between 2000 to 10000 Bengali Muslims were killed in Assam in the span of just six horrifying hours. This was one of the worst pogroms since WW2.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_massacre

The foremost priority of the government should be to assuage Assamese demands and that requires just the fulfillment of the NRC exercise. If there are any flaws in it then there will be redressal mechanisms but I'm not buying the anecdotal agenda driven stories about how some army man's name isn't there or how some president's brothers son isn't there. This is just a draft and by its very nature open for revision. As an analogy just because there are falsely convicted rape accused in prison doesn't mean that the courts and the police should stop the process of trying rape accused or convicting them.

Now the question is that what is to be done with the people who are finally found to be illegal immigrants. There will be lakhs of such people, it's an unfortunate fact that there has been large scale migration from Bangladesh into India and successive governments have either turned a blind eye to this or viewed this as a nice way to gain votes. Still it'll be logically impossible to either deport these people to Bangladesh as they're not gonna accept them or just house them in detention camps or jails cause that's just a massive waste of resources and also pretty inhumane. 

We can't let the status quo continue, a liberal way forward would be to declare these people as non citizens and provide them a path to citizenship in some time period, like 11 years of living in India without breaking any laws and then you'll be eligible for gaining citizenship. I don't think the Assamese would accept that. They'll probably be willing to accept that these people continue to live in India without gaining voting rights but then what do you do with children who were born in India and only happen to be born to illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. It's a very vexing issue as by Indian law just being born in India doesn't make you a citizen of the country. However, you can't have lakhs of people who have nowhere else to call home being forced to live a second class life and then pass on this second class status to their descendants and so on and so forth.

All in all this is a situation where there are no good options and we can only try and mitigate the worst options. It seems more than clear that the process is horribly flawed and is being used against actual citizens of the country. Remember that incident where a Kargil war veteran ended up on the rolls listed as a foreigner? Because of media outrage he will be fine. But the average citizen may not be as fortunate.

If this doesn‚Äôt happen them north east will burn like the 80s which i do not want. Anything is better than that mess.

Excellent news! The 1 dissenting judge is Pakistan appointed. Wow, Pakistanis are claiming this as a victory because the ICJ didn't direct him to be freed. 

Of course, this wasn't even what this case was about.

>THE HAGUE, 17 July 2019. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the principal judicial
organ of the United Nations, today rendered its Judgment in the Jadhav case (India v. Pakistan). In
its Judgment, which is final, binding and without appeal, the Court,

>(1) finds, unanimously, that it has jurisdiction, on the basis of Article I of the Optional
Protocol concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes to the Vienna Convention on
Consular Relations of 24 April 1963, to entertain the Application filed by the Republic of India on
8 May 2017;

>(2) rejects, by fifteen votes to one, the objections by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to the
admissibility of the Application of the Republic of India and finds that the Application of the
Republic of India is admissible;

>(3) finds, by fifteen votes to one, that, by not informing Mr. Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav
without delay of his rights under Article 36, paragraph 1 (b), of the Vienna Convention on Consular
Relations, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan breached the obligations incumbent upon it under that
provision;

>(4) finds, by fifteen votes to one, that, by not notifying the appropriate consular post of the
Republic of India in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan without delay of the detention of
Mr. Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav and thereby depriving the Republic of India of the right to render
the assistance provided for by the Vienna Convention to the individual concerned, the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan breached the obligations incumbent upon it under Article 36,
paragraph 1 (b), of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations;

>(5) finds, by fifteen votes to one, that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan deprived the Republic
of India of the right to communicate with and have access to Mr. Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav, to
visit him in detention and to arrange for his legal representation, and thereby breached the
obligations incumbent upon it under Article 36, paragraph 1 (a) and (c), of the Vienna Convention
on Consular Relations;
-
>(6) finds, by fifteen votes to one, that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is under an obligation
to inform Mr. Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav without further delay of his rights and to provide Indian
consular officers access to him in accordance with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on
Consular Relations;

>(7) finds, by fifteen votes to one, that the appropriate reparation in this case consists in the
obligation of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to provide, by the means of its own choosing,
effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of
Mr. Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav, so as to ensure that full weight is given to the effect of the
violation of the rights set forth in Article 36 of the Convention, taking account of paragraphs 139,
145 and 146 of this Judgment;

>(8) declares, by fifteen votes to one, that a continued stay of execution constitutes an
indispensable condition for the effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence
of Mr. Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav. Problem will still end in a death sentence. But now even that judgement will take a Year or 2. [The Judgement.](https://twitter.com/Harshaw12425249/status/1151477975658819584) As a Pakistani, I believe India won.

Caste system never goes away unless Govt stops officially issuing caste certificates but without these certificates people cannot get reservations. I don't see a future at least in next 4 or 5 decades we get rid of this shit. 

Maybe govt should bring in one-time reservation policy (everyone currently recognized as lower caste gets the reservations, after using it for job & education, they and their future generations should not be issued with caste certificate anymore) and slowly do away with recognizing castes officially in the first place. But that would be suicidal for any political party. 

On the rural level, we need more revolution as people live in segregated communities based on caste. We are living in 21st century with the beliefs of stone age. Reminds me of Princess Latifa. Can we please do something for her security?

We all know she is going to die in an ""road accident"" in few weeks followed by her father crying in front of a camera and then using MLA fund to minimize road accidents.

Please, lets do something for her security. Courageous people like her should be protected at all costs Looks like she is inspired from bollywood flicks like  jab We met and all, from the tone it is easy to make out that she is not financially independent.

I don't think his MLA father will take risk to kill her etc. But sureshot his political career is over as upper caste followers  would be the first one to dump him followed by others and rivals within party won't let go of this opportunity so easily. 

Have  seen such marriages within my extended relatives  and unfortunately none of them turned out to be good. Prime reason being 
Women not financially independent,abandoned by her parents  and some years later this lovey dovey things fades . Even in case of minor fights ,it pains when there is no one from your end to take your side.

Other thing is in India , you don't get married to a guy , you get married with a complete package which consists of his mother , father  relatives who will constantly remind you and  display you as a trophy girl among their community., caste thing will always be there till she is alive and anyway it is Purvanchal area in U.P, which is rampant for notorious casteism. Watched Ravish Kumar's show about this. Govt has schemes for such marriages : Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Intercaste marriage scheme, under which govt has to provide security and financial help to such couples.

But, govt doesn't give a shit about this and doesn't tell people about this scheme [deleted]", arcygenzy marooned12 bobixdok GangadharHiShaktiman KnusperPopcorn trolloindos yashovardhanchaubey throawayman20 None

"In my opinion, Amartya Sen is right about 'Jai Shri Ram' not being a Bengali culture",87,ccehqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccehqw/in_my_opinion_amartya_sen_is_right_about_jai_shri/,76,1562984142.0,"Sorry for posting about this so late. Wanted to, but had exams. Plus, I am shocked that this incident wasn't posted here by anybody while right wingers are bashing him calling him a 'leech' and 'trying to divide India'.

I am a Bengali. No, I ain't 'proud' of my culture. I don't believe you can be proud of something you got just by being born. Nor do I think Bengalis or Bengali culture is somewhat superior to other cultures. But here is the thing - 'Jai Shri Ram' isn't our culture. 'Jai Ma Durga/Kali' is.

I have observed that BJP/right-wingers have a belief that only their (central/North Indian) version of Hinduism is the only Hinduism. They completely ignore Eastern and Southern versions of it. They have trouble understanding the fact that Hinduism is an umbrella term for ALL religions in pre-British era India. Their obsession with Ram Mandir is a proof of it. From my experience, Hindus of South India and Eastern India have almost no interest in a Ram Mandir. Bengali Hindus mostly follow and believe in Shaktism, in Durga/Kali and our culture has been mainly influenced by Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and Sarada trio. And we have our temple - the Dakshineshwar temple. Odisha has Jaganath temple, a large temple, visited by millions of people around India. In South India, they have Tirumala, another huge temple with millions of devotees. Then you have Sabarimala, in the North you have the famous Amarnath temple, which attract a lot of pilgrims. Every part of India have their own favourite 'god'. In Hinduism, it says God is one but is worshiped in different forms by different rituals. Everyone has their own versions and they are devoted to them. I would argue, not a lot of Hindus are really into Ram to be honest. Of course, all Hindus respect Ram and believe he is an avatar, but not that important as a deity to worship.

Now, don't get me wrong, there are a lot of Marwaris, Biharis, etc here in Bengal and a lot of them say 'Jai Shri Ram'. Bengalis do respect their beliefs and often say 'Yeah, jai shri Ram' in response. But that's it. Anyone will devote themselves more to Kali/Durga rather than Ram here in Bengal.

It will sound really rude and discriminatory but I will say this very clearly - Hindi-speakers are that much foreign to many conservative Bengalis as are, say, Rohingyas to Indians. Why? Language barrier. We do not speak the same language. Hindi and its accent is difficult to imitate for many Bengalis. Our cultures are different. Many of our cuisines are different. Our ceremonies are different. Our attires are often different. A 'royal and rich' Marwari house is very different from a 'bonedi rich' Bengali house. I have heard numerous people, including my relatives, complain how non-Bengalis are taking over Bengal and we need to stop it (yeah, I know it is kind of discriminatory but I have heard this a lot). I mean heck, even our classic slangs are different.

BJP is hell bent on imposing Hindi and 'Jai Shri Ram' on the face of all Hindus. But that is just not the reality. Many Hindus don't (and don't want to) speak Hindi or pray to Ram or are interested in what happens in Ayodhya. The entrance of BJP in West Bengal has been more or less the same way TMC came into power - being out of options. CPM was a terrible choice for Bengal and the only option then was TMC. So, they rose to power. Now that BJP is in power and TMC and CPM both are terrible (Congress has been an unpopular choice), BJP is the only option. Plus, many of the BJP's members, like Locket Chatterjee, are very active here and does a lot of work for the people. But I don't think people of Bengal are really interested in this whole 'Hindutva/Hindi/Ram' thing.

A tip for BJP: If you want a good entrance here in Bengal you have to say 'Jai Ma' and 'Suorer baccha' first.",Suradoe,Politics," Very well said, I totally agree.

What I would like to add is that most Bengalis even today grow up with a completely different picture of Ramayana. Most of us have studied Michael's MeghnadVadh Kavya in school, which paints a contrasting picture of Rama and Laxmana. We have been taught to sympathise with Meghanada and not Laxmana - Laxmana was the bad guy!

Even the original Krittibashi Ramayana portrays Rama differently than the original Valmiki Ramayana - the Bengali version is heavily influenced by the Bhakti movement and thus portrays Rama as more of a family man and cuts out lot of the violence.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Another point, in the legend of Durga Puja, Durga literally slays a buffalo! Still today in some parts of Bengal a buffalo or more commonly a goat is sacrificed during the Puja. Trying convincing the North Indians to do this! Similarly vegetarianism is not Hindu Culture.

That could be Brahmanism or something else

I will eat Beef, Pork, carrot whatever I want. This religion does not really control your eating habits.

If someone wants to be vegetarian then they are free to avoid meat.

However why the fuck do they stop others from consuming Beef? This is not related to Hinduism at all

We never stop them from drinking Gomutra. 2 liter piyo, Mujhe kya

Some dumbfucks with a political agenda are trying to hijack Hinduism BJP is over ‚ÄòVande Mataram' because they themselves can't recite the whole song. >I have heard numerous people, including my relatives, complain how non-Bengalis are taking over Bengal and we need to stop it (yeah, I know it is kind of discriminatory but I have heard this a lot).

Blatant bigotry is never acceptable, but any minority or migrant community has to do their part in going the extra mile to be good residents, and to assimilate with modern society. On the flip side the host population should also be helpful towards minorities and migrants and give them whatever assistance they need to be productive citizens.

Certains sections of the twitterati get triggered when you even mention shitty behavior from some sections of society, but hatred towards BIMARU people festers when people see things like this. Similarly when muslims block roads and have prayer on loudspeakers that wakes people up people get annoyed (just as they should with bihari bhajans). Similarly with jains and certain kinds of pure-veg upper caste non-bengalis, their imposition of eggless/meatless in housing communities and the proliferation of restaurants pandering to them is also irritating.

The woke crowd of the modern SJW movement has this weird gospel where you aren't even allowed to criticize shitty behavior from any community. And any generalization is absolutely fascism.

This is extremely self-defeating since you're shutting down 100% valid criticism of bad behavior.

It goes like this:

far left: X community does no wrong, they are not backwards. How you see them is more important than what you actually do (fringe ideas, but the woke left is slowly creeping into the mainstream)

center left: X community is underprivileged and hence 
backwards and regressive, so we should help them as much as possible. They need to integrate.

center right: X community is regressive, they need to stop being regressive. They need to assimilate. We will help them, but not much and they aren't really entitled to anything. And then something something market forces will sort it out.

far right:  X community needs to be subjugated, expelled or eliminated (this is gradually entering the mainstream unfortunately)

Populist politics favors the far-left or the far right. More liberal and neoliberal politics keeps politics in the more sensible center-left and center-right, and that's a debate that *should* happen.

Unfortunately this spectrum doesn't really apply in India, and everything is much further right. We don't really have a debate around the center. In fact that kind of debate is more at home in the western world - but even there it is unfortunately getting hijacked with populist nonsense. You don't really find woke leftists in India outside of some very irrelevant twitter fringes, and most of Indian social media is ridiculously far right by western standards.

>BJP is hell bent on imposing Hindi and 'Jai Shri Ram' on the face of all Hindus. But that is just not the reality. Many Hindus don't (and don't want to) speak Hindi or pray to Ram or are interested in what happens in Ayodhya.

I have a feeling the hindutva project wants to homogenize India, and hinduism; most of the shakhas indoctrinate kids into their ideology. Quite a few bengali families are starting to get 'marwarified' - they join in with diwali instead of kali puja, holi instead of dol, hanuman chalisa and even bhajans. But broadly yes of course Amartya Sen is right.

Politics in WB other than that is sadly less about politics and ideology and more about whose thugs are stronger. That's the current battle to be honest. Never heard of Jai shri ram chants growing up in Bangalore. If I hear people shouting Jai shri ram around me now, which seems more and more probable, I would assume troublemakers are up to no good, and take it as a signal to vacate the area as soon as possible. Joy maa kaali What pisses me off the most is seeing how a bunch of politically opportunistic Bengalis like Dilip Ghosh are busy shoving down the narrative that 'Joy Shree Ram' has always been a part of Bengali culture, and people seem to be lapping it up! I would rather give up my Hindu identity than give up my Bengali identity. To me, a beef-eating Bengali Muslim is much more close than a vegetarian Hindu from Haryana or UP. I can relate more with a Bengali irrespective of his/her faith than a Hindu from another region. I am a Bengali first. BJP rule would rob every Bengali of his/her identity because it would impose the non-Bengali culture and values on Bengalis to make us Bengalis better Hindus. This will create a situation that was seen in East-Pakistan during the 1960s in which North Indian Muslims who immigrated to Pakistan tried to make Bengalis a better Muslim. North Indians (be they Hindu or Muslim) always had this superiority complex and they always tried to dominate Bengalis. Rule of BJP in Bengal = Dominance of North Indians. We will fight tooth and nail to thwart these imbeciles. >BJP is hell bent on imposing Hindi and 'Jai Shri Ram' on the face of all Hindus.

Not just hindus, and they're managing to do it. This country is going down the drain. Watch out for increasing violence and conflict if you haven't noticed already. So who else thinks there that there'll be large scale communal riots in WB before the elections? This is why I tell my friends BJP is a bigger threat to Hinduism than any secular parties.


Usually Polytheistic religions are more tolerant than monotheistic religions (especially Abrahamic religions) because they don't believe in 'One and only god' notion. That's what has kept Hinduism alive. Hinduism can take within itself disparate practices and influence other religions as well. (eg) Sufi Islam which is the reason why Indian Muslims number very few among terrorists compared to their huge numbers. 

By making Hinduism about one cause (Ram Temple) BJP is doing what people might call 'Abrahamification of Hinduism'. They polarize the country, kill people and justify the same in the name of religion (like it's a 'crusade'). Why is that these riots don't take place in TN or Kerala? Aren't they Hindus? 

Lot of important idols (especially from Chola era) in temples from Tamil Nadu villages were looted by Subash Kapoor who made a living out of it. Isn't this cause important for Hinduism? And yet I don't see BJP hitting the streets for it. Would it's reaction been the same if that guy was non-Hindu? It doesn't give a shit because this wouldn't fetch votes. 

By making it one God & one cause BJP is harming Hinduism. I hope right-thinking Hindus realize this and start rescuing their religion from BJP.", pro_crasSn8r 3xcited3lectron internet_baba Fluttershy_qtest dsenthu the100rabh None ektimeye charavaka braindead_in SocioliberalBuddha

FYI that Petitioner Bipin Bihari Singh was the Mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation & has alway been associated with BJP. Khaya piya kuch nhi, glass toda 12 aana. So women in Delhi can ride the metro for free?

Are free tickets also dependent on the economic status of women? Just curious, thanks. Lol why free? Are they not making the same amount of money as men? The free ride policy has good intention but its consequences are a nightmare. Lets say Delhi Gov allocates the money for the rides this year but next year the expense will only increase. Can they keep up with increased expense every year?

What if DMRC wants to increase prices of the rides in the future? Now, Delhi government is part owner of DMRC as well as a customer of DMRC. Doesn't it creates a conflict of interest? 

I am telling you this policy will just re-create the Railway mess on a smaller level.

E Sreedharan actually gave a viable suggestion for better implementation of the policy before being tagged as a BJP agent. He said give the beneficiary Direct Benefit Transfer for Metro rides.

Charge a few hundred upfront, just like they do for bus passes. This is one of the most stupidest idea I've ever seen. How on earth we can bring equality on society by giving such decision. When women are financially able to avail a ride, then what is the point of giving them free ride. Politicians like Kejriwal can do anything for appeasement politics. Has AAP shared their assessment report with Media on which they have taken the decision? from the comments, women's safety and delhi metro are being spoken about a lot. if women's safety is a fundamental problem then it should be addressed directly. govt will not be be left with any money to make all of delhi, not just metro, safe for women. Block everything. Block AAP from building hospitals, building schools etc. What is this guy's problem if the govt is reimbursing the metro for the policy? I am not from Delhi, so I am making assumptions here. I truly believe Metro is the most safest way to commute in Delhi. Secondly, IMHO Delhi is not so safe for Woman in general. Having safe passage will be a big boost in safety for these woman. This is counter productive in empowering women.What government is implying is that women don't earn enough or have any financial independence to even afford metro fare. 

Some women are also of the mind that if  it's free , metro would now be over-crowded with poor women who could not have afforded to ride the metro before this move.

Source: Saw a quint video on the topic.

Metro is already under loss.Writing off half the revenue would only lead to deterioration of the metro service and hinder any future expansion unless they are of the mind that they will just double the fare for men.

Would be interesting to see how Indians will find a way to exploit this.


Also, number of incidents of pick pocketing gonna increase to a new level as 90 percent  of the pickpockets in metros are women. Free water and subsidised electricity was also dismissed as a poll gimmick and non viable economically. But it still got them 67 and Delhi didn't go bankrupt. So calm the fuck down and see what happens. If India can afford stupid Patel statues, it can afford free and safe travel for our sisters. Jesus Christ, this entire comment section is full of centrist, elitist bullshit. 

This move on Kejriwal‚Äôs part is *not for any of you*. 

It‚Äôs targeted at lower-income groups and families where women are both primary and auxiliary earners for their families.

In many of these families, the net income comes from the men, so the ones ultimately saving money are the *men*. This is to incentivise these families to use safer modes of transport.

>	‚ÄúHow will we have equality if we keep having societal biases like this?‚Äù

Are you people out of your minds? This move comes precisely _because_ there is no equality currently. This move doesn‚Äôt encourage inequality, it‚Äôs to tip the scales less against women. 

If you really think men and women live equally safe and secure lives, get the fuck out of your bubbles. This problem is further exacerbated in lower income groups. Stop thinking about only yourselves, for once. i agree with sreedharan. lets nip the interference by local politicians into the matter of public transit right at the bud.

These cases will shake the humanity out of everyone. Motherfuckers. This was just start of two decades of extreme terror. At present Bengal is 'ruled' by TMC and slowly going at the cusp of BJP. I have friends who are concerned about the future of Bengal rightly so, bcs it's definitely not going in the right direction. But what I have noticed even the hardline BJP supporters talk in reverence about CPIM. They use the word 'shikkito'(educated) and 'vodro' (well-behaved) while talking about CPIM leaders. Even my friends who were barely  or twelve or thirteen years of age in 2011 when CPIM was defeated also feel  'nostalgic' about CPIM rule. It really baffels me whenever I hear this! If these leaders were what they were supposed to be none of these would have happened. 
 
In Marichjhapi they imposed an economic blockade even after High Courth ruled against it. Correct me If I'm wrong here Ashok Mitra,who did his Ph.D under Tinbergen, was then finance minister of Bengal back then. They hired Muslim goons to fire up the religious sentiment! 

Nirupam Sen,the leader mentioned in the post was the industrial minister of Bengal.He was from Burdwan.When he died his body was brought back to Burdwan for his last rites.I was quite surprised to see such a large number of people gathering to see their beloved Comrade for the last time.

Indian Medical Association to hold nationwide protest after attack on student doctor,391,c04a7g,https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/indian-medical-association-hold-nationwide-protest-after-attack-student-doctor-103540,218,1560451739.0,,BaidDSB,Politics," If the patient is cured: Thank God. Doctor who?

If the patient dies: These fucking doctors!

I feel sad for doctors. Terrible working conditions coupled with long hours. On top of that they have to deal with this shit. Mamta said that doctors are looking at patient's surname and refusing to treat muslims. What a joke!! I have studied and worked in 3 medical colleges in WB till date and let me tell you the majority of the population seeking free treatment are muslims. In my last hospital we werent even sure whether they were Indian nationals. Do we not treat them ? What about my fellow Muslim doctors ? Do they refuse to treat Hindu patients ? Trying to incite communal violence against doctors is the last straw! Religion is the last thing on our mind when we encounter a patient! Good. This type of vandalism towards professional doctors should never be tolerated. What is worst is Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee saying that protesting doctors are all outsiders, and the attacks were conspiracy of CPI(M) and BJP

8 docs have resigned in protests (/u/BaidDSB reporting from the ground as 18)

Condition of the Doctors from the mob attack (NSFL warning): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D867pU4VsAAnbkQ.jpg Lol and Mamata is threatening the doctors. Then she'll wonder why the public hates her [removed] As a medical student, I feel bad that we have to stop treating patients to draw attention towards us. Hate that it came to this, but we deserve to be safe in a fucking hospital. Or anywhere else for that matter.
Hope something is done soon so the patients don't have to suffer. This is scary. 

As a junior doctor in a government hospital, I am all too familiar with such events. It‚Äôs only good luck that I have personally never been injured or attacked. 

Junior doctors in government hospitals are made to work under inhumane conditions. 

Just in the months of April and May this year, I have worked several 54 and 36 hour shifts- and often didn‚Äôt get time to eat meals during all that time. 

I did not get a single day off. Not even Sundays. 

I‚Äôve literally only drunk ORS to keep myself going. 

I‚Äôve literally been so sleepy I couldn‚Äôt keep my eyes open. I ended up getting pricked by contaminated needles as a result.

Several colleagues of mine have been exposed to HIV in this manner. They are currently on treatment (PEP) and have to wait a few agonising weeks to find out if they are HIV positive. 

At 3 am, I got pricked by a contaminated needle- the patient had been abandoned and there were no relatives to give us a proper medical history. I had to wait for 2 hours for the patient‚Äôs HIV test results, and I almost broke down out of fear and anxiety. Longest two hours of my entire life. I will admit I contemplated suicide in the event that the test would come out positive. (I know that the risk of infection is low, and that PEP is very effective, but I was sleep-deprived and hungry, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think of the worst case scenario). 

I‚Äôve been coughed on by TB patients, had urine and feces smeared all over me, and been exposed to all kinds of diseases. I lost 7 kgs in 6 weeks. I was on antibiotics for 2 weeks- and I was still working. I was just given a mask so as not to spread my infection to patients, and then I was expected to continued working. 

I know doctors who spent their own money to buy supplies that the government can‚Äôt provide, because patients can‚Äôt afford them.

I spent 30 mins searching in the store room of the hospital to find some vials of drugs because the patient‚Äôs family could not afford to buy them (when the government supply is low, we just offer palliative care, or ask patients to buy drugs if they can afford to). I found them; and a nearly-dead patient walked out of the hospital 1 week later. His mother said some really rude things to me as thanks (I don‚Äôt blame her; I cannot imagine how hard it must have been for her to see her son in that condition). 

And I am extremely lucky to have not faced many difficulties- my friends have gone through much much worse. 

We joined this field because we care about patients. At 17, I was a bright eyed, naive little girl who had big dreams- dreams of saving the world.
I‚Äôm 22 now, and just 2 months of working as a junior doctor/house surgeon has killed most of my dreams. 

This is not okay. I do not deserve to fear for my life every single day. [removed] Why haven't the people who attacked the doctors been charged? Pasting comment of u/Quantum_menance

I have friends in CMC. Condition is really bad. It all started with 200 muslim goons coming to NRS after the death of a elderly Muslim person whose family complained a junior doctor killed him by giving an injection. They threw stones and beat the junior doctors and interns. The police didn't respond at all. Only two constables came. They only came after the incident. Mamata Banerjee has recently said that the muslims vote for her so she is willing to take any trouble that they give. Given it was 200 well prepared muslim goons and a the police's deliberate non show up given the proximity of the neatest police station and constables inside the hospital area one wonders if this incident was pre-planned. One of the students got a sevre fracture on his skull. Then again next day this beating happened whose pic has been posted by op. As a consequence the students have gone on strike. The local media is trying to spin it as doctors unfairly not treating patients.

https://imgur.com/X3jpa0L

I hope the imgur links are working. In it you will find

1. Mamata Banerjee has threatened the students if they don't stop their protest within 4 hrs (deadline has already passed) she will take action and has said that the students are bjp and cpim supporters and outsiders trying to create problems

2. The spin that the local media is trying to give the story. They are trying to show the doctors as inhuman people who won't treat kids and urging civilians not to take their side

Update - 
1.Another student in NRS has been hurt by stone pelters. His friends who are junior doctors is saying he has got a fracture in his skull. Situation is really dire

2. The student who was attacked initially is ok. He is still under care. But it seems he is clear. Live streaming is happening by multiple bengali news channel. I saw him sitting up finally on live stream by ABP news. 

3. The NRS principal has resigned just now at 9 pm

4. They were attacked by goons just after CM left as reported by multiple students on local news channel

5. The smaller towns are also facing the same thing with people blaming all the doctors and in some cases they are also being ganged upon

6. Senior doctors have started giving mass resignation in some places and nurses and senior doctors are also joining in the protest. In a lot of places emergency unit is open but outdoor is closed

7.  Multiple AIIMS has also declared a strike for one day and are urging other colleges to join in", praboi icemunmun iwillfuckingrant GreatAd8 Themakeroflists None ana_bananaa AP7497 None cartoon_soldier Aalusesonabanayenge
The all new bullet train.,504,c7sddk,https://i.redd.it/x4z99k4hyo731.jpg,53,1562015362.0,,dr137,Politics," i like that for some reason What is everyone's opinion about the bullet train? I personally like it and think it would be a welcome addition to our train network and it might come at a few expenses (which must be reduced as much as possible) but necessary. 

I also know people who think it is an absolute waste of money, time and resources. So, which is more accurate? Finally, no more poeple would die by coming under the train! Live up to it's name and use bullets instead. I have some experience commuting on this route and I can say this - we need more commuter trains on this stretch. Most people commute from intermediate smaller stations to Surat, Baroda, Ahmedabad and Bombay. This crowd is a set of students and blue collar workers - salesmen, clerks and factory workers. They ain't got the money to ride the bullet train. 

The white collar employees (like my brother) travel by car on this stretch because roads are quite good. Even they will not use bullet train because it will not stop at my small town railway station not at his small town factory. If anything there can be a new metro like train via the highway to absorb the increasing traffic on the roads. In short, the bullet train will not solve the problem for the masses. There already have many high speed trains that run on this route for the premium point to point traveller.  An upgrade to better tracks will let the existing trains much faster. But of course that won't make the headline or the cut they need. 

Considering we are not a rich country and we have a huge population to cater to that still needs to commute from smaller villages to big towns, it is stupid to invest this money in solving the problems for the rich few rather than the common masses. Our existing railways need a lot of upgrade. Pehle vo to thik kar lo.

1. Land is not under their control. It is under DDA (Delhi Development Authority). DDA says mohalla clinic are not covered under so called master plan, hence they wont give land. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/land-for-210-mohalla-clinics-dda-says-no-provision-in-master-plan/articleshow/67579223.cmshttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/land-for-210-mohalla-clinics-dda-says-no-provision-in-master-plan/articleshow/67579223.cms
2. MCD has also demolished few built up but yet to start mohalla clinic buildings, saying 'we cannot allow you to build on our land'.

In short for Kejri it is: Hum karein to karein kya Mohalla Clinics are a great idea.

Sad that politics got into this. What the headline fails to mention: BJP-controlled MCD demolished some under-construction Mohalla clinics. DDA does not come under the state government. The LG did his best to stall any work by AAP. And yet, despite this, Kerjriwal & co. push through with their healthcare and education promise. Atleast they have such in their agenda and they talk about such things rather then mandir etc.. All in all.. Better than bjp At least 3 years were wasted on the fuckery by the LG and the MCD.

People of Delhi, please become smarter than this and don't put BJP in power at the NCT government. You guys already gave them all the Parliament seats in this election. So how many of them exist?

[Faces of Emergency: Kerala's political prisoners recall darkest chapter of Indian history - Sivadasan was among the around 8,000 persons picked up during Emergency in Kerala and subjected to unspeakable police brutality during the darkest 19 months of Indian democracy.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2019/jun/25/faces-of-emergency-keralas-political-prisoners-recall-darkest-chapter-of-indian-history-1994827.html)

> Sivadasan was among the around 8,000 persons picked up during Emergency in Kerala and subjected to unspeakable police brutality during the darkest 19 months of Indian democracy.

> ‚Äú**No other political protest anywhere in the world had seen 1.75 lakh political activists put in prison at a given time**,‚Äù says Vaikkom Gopakumar, 70, who was then RSS chief in Alappuzha. He was arrested on August 1, 1976, for spearheading various protests against Emergency. After his arrest, the police kept him in an old building near the police station at Muppalam in Alappuzha and assaulted him for 16 days. ‚ÄúThe police would take me to a corner and bang my head against a wall and it would rebound and hit the next wall,‚Äù says Gopakumar.

> The officer who headed the interrogation room, Gopinathan Nair, **used to drag Gopakumar by holding on to his penis and scrotum**. ‚ÄúIt was a new technique the officer experimented on me,‚Äù he says.

> ‚ÄúWhen I was brought to the magistrate‚Äôs house, the officer left me outside and went in to get the documents signed. I was in bad shape after 16 days of torture,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMy eyes were swollen. I could not stand after they rolled wooden stick over my legs and hit my spine,‚Äù he says.

> Sivadasan recalled how the police used to ‚Äòfly aeroplane‚Äô on protesters. ‚ÄúThey tied my arms behind my back and made me run in the room while constantly kicking me and hitting me with the butt of the rifle,‚Äù he says.

> After nine days of brutality, he was sent to Thiruvananthapuram Central Prison. He remained in jail for 16 months and was out on March 22, 1977, after Emergency was revoked.

> Pai, who had participated in satyagraha, was picked up thrice by police. Only on the last arrest was he sent to Ernakulam Sub-Jail. ‚ÄúOnce an officer put two claws of chicken in his ears and gave him the dreaded double ear slap. He has been deaf since then,‚Äù says Raveendran, a former president of Kasaragod‚Äôs BJP unit. God it boils my blood whenever I see it. Congress should be kept out of the parliament at any cost This is how every dictator starts out, by declaring a state of emergency and things never go back to the way they were.

Its very strange then that Indira Gandhi gave up all this control and went for general elections in such short duration. You have to really believe in democracy to make that step, knowing full well that you have antagonized the population enough to lose.

I wonder then what her motivations were for the emergency if they weren't absolute power or control. I mean I understand the trigger, the Supreme Court judgement, but there has to be more to it if she decided to go back to the way democracy functioned.

Perhaps there actually was enough foreign interference and threat from the CIA to warrant it, especially since the USA was pretty anti-India during those times. Our Military purchases were almost exclusively from Soviet Russia and US companies werent even considered, and that angered the powers to be of the mega capitalist. how many countless numbers of times are we going to repost this Today, we have an undeclared emergency.

____________________________

[Link to yesterday‚Äôs update thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c0gs40/wb_doctor_strike_live_updates_thread/)",Fluttershy_qtest,Politics," Pan-India strike on 17th June Similar incident happened at my college few years ago. Mob attack 2 surgical residents because of some CT Scan technical issue. Both of them were thrashed but recovered within a week a two. We protested for a week, our Dean and Medical Superintendent instead of sympathizing, told us to call it off because that would upset some caste. Fortunately, almost 80-90% of them got arrested. Security was uplifted but few weeks later it's still the same. If a mob were to attack today at the same place, I'm 100% sure they will be successful.

That's why I feel hopeless about the situation. These strikes will definitely make a huge impact but as long as these mobs are backed up by politicians, nothing can stop them. I am reading a lot of - doctors ""reject"" or ""refuse"" Mamta's plea, when it should be Mamta Banerjee ""refuses"" to show up at the hospital to provide reassurance to victim doctors and their families.

Mamta Banerjee further has shown no intent to walk to the doctors protesting in heat of Kolkata to listen to their concerns or take any action.

Mamta Banerjee, instead, has chosen this unfortunate event to demoralize, defame and threaten physician community, and to go further and play Hindu-Muslim politics.

Mamta Banerjee is solely responsible for not addressing physician concerns all over the country, originating in her own state, and letting entire state population suffer from limited healthcare services, and not taking blame for it.

Media is in dire need of education here on how to deliver facts!! Currently posted in Casualty. Had a close call last night. The patient was allegedly drunk and had an RTA. He came at 3.30 and we resuscitated with oxygen and suctioning his oral cavity. His SpO2 improved. We then called surgery and they came and saw. But the patient‚Äôs friend was a another drunk guy who called more of his friends. And then they started to record a video and they were shouting abuses at us. This happened when we had to shift the patient for a CT to rule out intracranial bleed. Scary shit. Very close to physically assaulting us. Is beating doctors a West Bengal thing or happens in other parts of the country as well? I am hearing it for the first time. Why would you beat someone trying to save lives? and the dumbass CM can go on political rallies but can't even visit the hospital where the incident took place. instead, she blames ""outsiders"" of instigating the movement. like seriously! you had a perfect opportunity to be the good guy and you blew it up bad. This is what happens when illiterate people are voted into power.

now she is like, come to Nabanna (the office of CM) and we will talk. The doctors responded: hell no, you come here. how difficult it is for her to just go to the hospital and assure protection? ego?

its high time we have an actual educational qualification requirement for politicians in India. Media and government is handling our situation really poorly. Media is only showing the protest and the ill effects it's causing but not the cause of our protest. I've seen no news channel yet disclosing the incidents which lead to this, I'm not talking about wb but many other incidents. I'll link one of them below and tell me if it is safe for any of the doctors to treat anyone.  https://medicaldialogues.in/no-stop-on-violence-gynecologist-beaten-with-rods-after-patient-dies-in-ccu/ Finally the WB govt agreed. 

Now the most important and most crucial step will be taken - Whether the promise is actually delivered. 

Just saying it will be done is not enough.  Loi bhi bolke ja sakta h.  It's important to see if it WILL be done. Many people are thinking that the Nationwide strike is politically motivated and that the doctors are actually controlled by a certain right wing party.

First off, are you even aware or are you just dumb enough to assume that everything in this country is political?!

The students and the interns first went on strike. Then the IMA came to support! IMA is independent of any political party! We doctors have enough on our plate to worry about already . 

The working conditions in most of the govt hospitals is basically shit, but we still, amidst all the hardships come there to treat everyone. 

The Govt needs to update its Healthcare policy seriously! It won't just get resolved by opening more colleges and providing Bridge course ( that's another bullcrap ) . It needs to be fixed from the ground! Better infrastructure and better security!

What the hell will you do if someone just comes and beats you up at your place of work for something that was totally out of your hand , even if you tried your best?! 

Will you be fucking going to political parties?

Most of the patients who blame the treatment or the doctors are themselves unaware. They go to their local 'docs ' who are actually most of the time quacks or from AYUSH and treat patients with their pseudo knowledge. Then when the conditions worsen, they come to the govt hospital? Why? Cheap treatment... 

We never turn away patients based on their religion or caste or any fucking thing else. We treat them as humans. They all are the same in front of us.

People should understand, that if the savior themselves aren't safe, then how the fuck will they be expected to show up at an unsafe work environment?

Will you go yo your place of work if it had regular beatings and outrage? 

The comments here are really worrisome . bengal can never catch a break. from one strangling admin to another. it's a pity because it's junta is so opinionated and enlightened and such a major export in thought leadership. and yet the home is such a confused mess. As a doctor myself I just came here to say that I'm so grateful to all the people who have shown their support for us in this difficult time. 

And to those who feel we're in the wrong here, let me assure you that my field is such, we want nothing more than to get back to full time work as soon as possible. I'm sorry that it's happening this way, but things just cannot go on this way.", krisha282 MaestroC96 Janana_18 hapy9 Hk6919 bengaliguy Bot_Me_Daddy heteretes DrAwesome04 None arch_kaps
Rahul Gandhi offers to resign as Congress chief after humiliating Lok Sabha loss : Sources,1087,bs2kv5,https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/elections/lok-sabha-2019/story/-rahul-gandhi-offers-to-resign-as-congress-chief-after-humiliating-lok-sabha-loss-1532930-2019-05-23,356,1558644771.0,,loremusipsumus,Politics," When he offered his resignation there was a loud emotional group that chanted ""Please don't resign, we need you there."" 

On further inspection this was found to be a group of BJP supporters. So Rahul Gandhi gave his resignation to Rahul Gandhi which will be rejected by Rahul Gandhi because Rahul Gandhi says resignation is not a solution of problems created by Rahul Gandhi. Sonia Gandhi rejects his decision. Enough with this nautanki. [UPDATE : Sonia Gandhi rejects resignation offer.](https://www.news18.com/amp/news/politics/rahul-gandhi-offers-to-resign-as-congress-president-after-another-rout-sonia-gandhi-says-no-2157043.html) If I were Raga, I would not offer, I will resign with immediate effect. Go back to Amethi and stay there till UP elections. Build cadre there and ensure Congress's win in at least 10 assembly constituencies around Amethi and build some self respect. 

Stop spreading these news through source to gain sympathy for your bootlickers to say ""no no please don't"" 
Honestly, he should resign. 

INC is in need of a new face, a leader who can stand up to the likes of Modi and Shah which is an extremely challenging task in itself, RaGa just isn‚Äôt capable of doing that. 

I don‚Äôt like Modi, but I don‚Äôt hate him either. He projected himself not only as a politician, but as a genuine leader... 

I feel quite sad for RaGa today, but the reality is, he just doesn‚Äôt have what it takes to be a politician..

*Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be. The measure of a person, is how well they succeed at being who they are.* I think the only way INC‚Äôs dynastic hegemony will end is if they suffer successive defeats in the elections reducing their relevance. They did not learn from 2014 mandate and they will not learn from 2019. 

It is ridiculous that a pan india party wins seats less than local parties. 

I think we will see more of the MGB style alliances forming to be a viable opposition front rather than a strong single pan india opposition party which is not optimal because you have ragtag mix of local parties without a uniform agenda that can potentially take on power at center. At this point anyone who wants RaGa to stay as head of congress is actually bjp supporters..

Seriously though modi have some much to thank him. Because of RaGa today NDA have the biggest mandate since 1984!!! 

How can anyone screw this badly is beyond me..any common rickshaw driver might actually be better politician than RaGa CWC won‚Äôt accept it . Mummy ko resignation dega kya Forget offering to resign. He should just do it. He has offered in the past too.

One nation...,333,c6540h,https://i.redd.it/dbc877o2bw631.jpg,59,1561668500.0,,sudden_dust,Politics," A misplaced cartoon in bad taste. Govt hasn't spent a dime on ONOE while there are several projects to tackle water crisis is going on. Satish Acharya is losing it. How is this different to the west saying India shouldn't have a space program when there's poverty in the country? Next no road in city. Ask Modi. What is the purpose of state government?    First Tamilian want water or only Kaveri water.  Fuckers can‚Äôt solve Kaveri issue from 100 years. What happen to those hundreds of lakes in Chennai ? Did they went for a walk ? Who occupied those river land. First question them.  Centre can‚Äôt bring water. They can help you with funds,guidance and water disputes with neighbouring state.  Take a look at Telangana. How they are building big project like kaleshwaram. Even though it not viable to supply water. But they gave importance to water at the cost of thousand of crores. Doesn't utilities like water come under the purview of the state? ONOE - national issue

Water crisis - a state issue Water crisis is an issue I like to study a lot. I would say its fundamentally not political but an issue of protecting ecological life. I think its best to treat issues like this as something everyone has equal value to fix. Just some retarded Leftists who don't understand the concept of cabinet of ministers or the point of division of responsibilities between state and federal government or that fact that there are different ministries that are there to address fucking issues like these. But yeah, water crisis is somehow the fault of the prime minister and he should be the one to drop EVERYTHING at once to fix it. I..don't see the connection?

I'm always annoyed by these cartoons. What does ONOE have to do with the water crisis? It's not like they are reducing the water fund for this, or diverting civil servants from the Jal Shakti Ministry.

They imply a simplicity that doesn't exist to look smart. Charlatans masquerading as philosophers. So its like, choose Modi and ask him to talk with the climate? The water crisis is of our own making. Whoever the PM is.

‡≤†_‡≤† These politicians have already fucked up science in this ~~country~~ contry. The least they can do is teach correct spelling.

One minister dismissed the theory of evolution while IT minister said aadhaar data can't be hacked because it's kept behind a huge wall. 

Even pm has made some really stupid remarks in a straight matter of fact tone. It's not like someone's grilling him on these questions, he's just making shit up for no reason. 

 Shit like plastic surgery in Mahabharat times to planes taking cover in clouds to saying he used to send emails in the 1980's even though it was introduced in India in the 90's to saying climate has not changed we have changed and that older people actually feel it's getting colder every year because of their age to saying he saw a tea seller utilize bio fuel by sticking a pipe inside a gutter.

If she were concerned about Muslims the most impactful thing she could do would be to stop the genocide in Yemen, which is within the power of the US. That has already killed multiple times the number of Muslims killed in all riots combined in post 1947 India. Posturing for trade talks.

Flip side, India is free to express concerns for minority citizens, kids in cages etc. So caring. /s To be fair, muslims are safer in USA than in India. (opinion) They aren't about human rights at all. If they were, they wouldn't ally with Saudi Arabia. They are just angry at how we tax their products. Should focus on China that is running concentration camps for muslims. Kids are being separated from their parents at young age and they say they are willingly doing it. But China is too important to mess with for USA. Lol just because Nancy said it, doesn‚Äôt meant the whole of USA feels that way. What a clickbait headline.

Something about Rahul Gandhi hit me hard.,1376,bokvwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bokvwa/something_about_rahul_gandhi_hit_me_hard/,448,1557878915.0,"At 14 years old he saw his beloved grandma get shredded with bullets by the man he used to play with. 
At 21 his father was blown up by terrorists. He didnt even get to see his father's body one last time. 

Deaths are never good. People always get hurt for life and some take a lifetime to recover from the loss of a loved one. But grotesque deaths of not one but TWO close loved ones? I am surprised Rahul didnt go insane from the shock or become a drug/alcohol addict. 

He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves. And never used pity politics to gain votes. 

So when people call him Pappu or make fun of his dad's death, it fills me up with rage because when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life. Something most of us will never or never did suffer in life. 

I dont support Congress, but lets not insult or let neech aadmi's insult and hurt those soft spots.",BaidDSB,Politics," Most of us would have hung our heads in same after being called Papu 24*7 but that guy has the balls to come out and face the crowd. I also lost my dad when I was 21 üò¢ Yes. This.

I hate congress and BJP both.

But I never got the unwarranted hate towards RG. (and more so, towards Kejriwal.)

I get that Indian politics isn't a clean haven, but ridiculing someone's identity and making a joke out of everything related to that person, is taking to another level.

I applaud RG for not giving up and still facing the crowd and the camera, with such calmness.

And frankly, his recent interview with Ravish, made me realize he's wayyy better than Modi. At least, he's open to criticism and questions. honestly, whoever wins this election, Rahul Gandhi has become a commendable person in my eyes. dude got balls the size of domes to be shamed publicly to such an extent daily in an out, and still act as a statesman of high order. He can use deaths of his family and honestly get a lot of sympathy votes, but he knows that would be biggest disrespect to their lives, he may not be a great politician, but he is a great person imo. His steep learning curve and resilience are actually inspiring. The interview with Ravish Kumar he says "" Rahul Gandhi has to be eliminated, and I must channel the public's mandate "". That is a very deep and Zen/Upanishadic thought. All the humiliation against himself and his mother (calling her waitress euphemism for prostitute)  he took it in stride and really grew. His message is about inclusion and love. He readily admits his mistakes and is willing to learn. And his assertive nature is very evident in his interviews. If youth in this country are looking for a life lesson this is the guy. 

On the other hand we have the hate spewing Modi whose life message is when you mess up dont own up and instead keep distracting by criticising others. I want to ask bhakts if their children would keep blaming their failures on others would they not teach them to take responsibility? This character deficiency becomes a virtue on Modi. Strange times we live in. Not a Congress or BJP supporter (NACOBS - everyone use this acronym to save time üòã), but Modi would've gained so much sympathy by crying in his speeches if something similar had happened to him. I dont admire Rahul but I absolutely hate Narendra Modi.

He is a grade 1 dumbfuck They call him that because 90% of Indians love making fun of others in a very mean way. Primitive Homo Erectus culture is well and alive in India. They even make fun of IIT grad Kejri because he wears mufflers, coughs and doesn't wear suits or what not. I too lost my grandma when I was 15. She used to talk to me everyday. Still, after 3 years I still feel like she's been talking to me every evening over the phone. There might be about 99 things wrong with Rahul Gandhi but his Never Give Up attitude is worth noting.

Most such freebie exercises end badly with those paying the taxes usually deciding to get out and finding out it's better to go someplace else. The infrastructure then decays and the politicians move on to the next asset they can gut for votes.

Hopefully this left wing stupidity dies soon. No freebies, pay for stuff or GTFO He worked really hard for the metro projects, he knows the struggle.

I oppose her being jailed, or any legal action taken against her because I support **Free Speech.**

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't criticize her, she was clearly supporting terrorists, and as a journalist outlet it's their duty to point it out and criticize her action. Kya chutiya log hai ye Why don't they honor the martyrs instead?

On the day of the incident, there was zero help provided by the police or the politicians until the hospital became an actual battlefield and the boys hostel burned. Heck even the girl hostels were surrounded and were threatened with rape. There was no entry or exit. 


Heck the WB govt. only measly excuse of support  after the incident had taken place and the the doctors had been on strike for a couple of hours.


Imagine being an eighteen year old kid having high hopes and aspirations of becoming a doctor and helping people. Then this happens, suddenly it becomes clear why a majority of doctors leave India as soon as they complete their education. Attack on doctors in WB is part of a toxic ""culture"" of destruction of public property and beating the officials prevalent here for a long time. Not only the doctors but policemen, teachers, government officials, forest guards and most commonly the staff of the electricity department are often attacked here. The government usually doesn't take much action against those hooligans.

What we need here is rule of law. Punish these miscreants heard and those idiots would not dare to do it again. ####700 Doctors have quit in Bengal now

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/over-700-medicos-quit-hospitals-in-solidarity-healthcare-in-coma/articleshow/69796135.cms Despite being a doctor, I'd like to reiterate, peaceful protests never changed anything. Gandhi was popularized by it. But it was not non violence that drove the British away. It was the bankruptcy and a threat of rebellion. Why don't central govt deploy CISF to safeguard hospitals...

This issue of doctors under threat isn't specific to a state, it's a pan India issue...


And CISF is a force raised with mandate to safeguard assets of India...


But, what is central govt doing...

Before anyone points, yes both healthcare and security is under state list.. Kinda hypocritical of the bjp. 

When all those children died in gorakpur. The first thing they did was to go after the innocent doctor. Pave the way for BJP my dear doctors.

Sorry, I for one officially resign supporting the movement henceforth. It doesn't matter anyways. But I hope doctors had pressed on the 5 point memorandum they sent to the CM on day 1. I don't support mamata and I literally hate BJP, and I won't vote for either, once again, as I did last time.

No matter what party they represent, they're all self indulgent, narcissistic species who think and believe that they're above all.

This is certainly a hyperbole, but politicians today are they the new ""Brahmins""/ feudal lords/ nobility that we've witnessed throughout the history of the entire world. Each with touch me not, holier than thou mentality.

None of these scums is actually in it for the betterment of the society. They all come with their own vested interests and rampant nepotism. They're the elite club you'll never be able to convey your real problems, let alone join them. They come and go and rob you off your everything without you noticing what you lost.

Why can't this A-hole drive through to the nearest helipad? I checked on Google maps and Guntur currently has helipad in place. Why waste so much public money? But then why call out this, when we have a 3000 cr statue made for birds to shit on. well well well....so begins the reign of another crooked politician Why does he need a helipad , just go the airport save 1.9cr wtf wait he also probably wants to go 1st class ...

2. On page 123 of the report it says ""by 2020, 21 major cities, including Delhi, Bangalore, and Hyderabad, are expected to reach zero groundwater levels, affecting access for 100 million people.""
3. However, this is not the report's original finding. The citation says: ""Source: World Bank (Hindustan Times, The Hindu)"".
4.

5. The World Bank report from 2012 is not a report but an [article](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/03/06/india-groundwater-critical-diminishing).

6. Nowhere in that 2010 report it mentions about Indian cities running out of groundwater.
7. The blame goes to Hindustan Times for probably putting fake citation, NITI Aayog for probably hiring clueless interns to write reports and news outlets for blindly citing NITI Aayog reports without cross-checking.",NOTA-Voter,Politics," Thanks for clarifying.

TIL NITI cites newspaper regarding such critical claims. So NITI Aayog is another whatsapp group unkill? I was listening to a podcast where a water management expert was saying such panicky news was resulting in the major stakeholders of the city to push for and govt to come up with drastic centralised solutions like diverting far away rivers, instead of concentrating on simple and distributed solutions like water conservation, water recycling, and rain water harvesting.


Edit: This the [podcast](https://ivmpodcasts.com/harate-kannada-podcast-episode-list/2019/3/6/ep-13-water-and-bengaluru). It is in Kannada.

A different [article](https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/plan-to-supply-linganamakki-water-to-bluru-senseless-740996.html) in English says more or less the same. It has quotes from the IISC professor(not the same person as the water management expert from the podcast) who made the dead city by 2020 famous.

>According to T V Ramachandra of the Centre for Ecological Sciences of IISc, Bengaluru, annual rainfall of Bengaluru is 770 mm and rainwater yield is 14.80 tmc per year.

>The water availability in the city is 30.85 tmc per year, which includes treated domestic wastewater of 16 tmc. The domestic demand is 2.05 tmc per year. So,there is no shortage of water, he said. He said senseless large-scale projects (to transport water through pipes) have failed in the country. The government, which is in the clutches of contractors, consultants and corrupt engineers, is keen on implementing large-scale diversion projects. This gives scope to pilfer public money, he added. I had a chance to work with some journalists, I can say that hardly any journo do the amount of work you did while writing these articles. If you target a one reputed outlet in publishing a fake news, all of them just copy-paste it. 

Recently I read some NITI Aayog reports, writing style is so amateur. Even govt. dept. publish better reports than NITI. NITI Aayog was a mistake. 

They had one job and they‚Äôre proving themselves incapable to do it.

Thanks for the good work. Good work.

X number of cities running out of water in next few years sounds far stretched.

Something like X city may run out of minimum water requirements by 2021 or something similar sounds more legit.

But then, media won't get traffic they desire unless they don't post their articles with clickbait titles. Good work detective! Frankly, I don't mind. If it's going to push politicians to actually do some work related to water security, this is a justified evil. Being complacent is way too easy in India. Just like someone said other day
NITI Aayog just makes better PDFs. Really? Not even Bangalore? There were reports from IISc and the likes too.

Hinduphobic or not the series is a drag. BC kitna slow progression they have unnecessarily stretched so many scene to even when nothing is happening in it. I guess they chose ""make it slow for dramatic effect"" route.

I LOLed very hard when Dixit's wife gives her son the Bal Joshi YouTube videos which were exactly like the Bal Narendra comics. Man, did they rip off Homefront poster? Dystopian future where people speak Hindi !!

That is crazy :) Oh! I watched the first episode last night and I got through it just so that I can see how the episode ends. It is stupendously bad. Especially the direction. I felt the vision was lazy and unnecessarily obtuse. I love dystopian series and when I heard that they're mixing Right wing stupidity with Futuristic dystopia, I was all in. But the  thinly veiled hindutva bashing was extremely heavy handed and came of as just tiggers to the easily offended. And as a result the theme kept distracting me from the actual story. I couldn't relate to a single character and really couldn't care less no matter what happened to any of them.

I'm not sure if I'll watch the second episode but I felt like this was a missed opportunity to make something that could actually make you think about things. But instead of getting more people in, it felt like the series was designed to keep more people out. I watched the entire first season. I'll just get something out of the way first. The show is okay, not mind blowing to any degree. 

The setting was really on point though. The rules of this extreme society were directly based on superstitious and rituals Indians follow in their day to day life. Things like: Lower castes not allowed to enter upper caste regions, the obsession with purity, labeling anyone who criticizes the country as anti national, complete ban on meat, fish and egg and of course, marrying outside your caste/religion.

Most comments about the show being anti Hindu are just coming from people who are unable to accept the reality. And its just religious mentality. The belief that your own religion can never be wrong but everyone else definitely is. Let Streisand effect do its part. This is how strong the RW brigading is on Whatsapp/Twitter. 1 post from an influencer and 1000s are willing to obey. Exactly how it is depicted in the show!

Civil Society in India is a joke. Kaha milega itna content? If a terror accused can reach in Parliament, why would anyone suprise garlanding a political leader for beating up a public servant. Indian mind works on herd mentality or in subtle term : momentum. That is why mob culture is so prevalent. If we see others are doing a particular thing without facing any repercussion, most will follow to do the same.

Presently, BJP has infiltrated the minds of people through ingenious use of Social media mainly Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter in that order. They always hammer the fact through various fake news, misrepresentation that supreme leader working for people and the opposition is trying to prevent him from doing so. There is nothing to stop this. People are too lazy to use their rational thinking. Moreover, some people will happily believe what his cousin forwarded in the Whatsapp rather than what is published in The Hindu/NDTV. In this case also, Whatsapp message must have shown how this youngstar has fought with a corrupt official with his bat. 

Until a significant event happens that can shake up the status quo, people will only go along the route shown by BJP. Like what Anna Hazare did with UPA2 (influenced also by the Nirbhaya case which kind of shake the people), Opposition needs some big thing to play. 

But the key is not to attack the Govt. blindly. It is to state that people are suffering from Govt. corruption/inadequacies. People do not care if BJP is more rich than Congress. They only care what is happening with their life. Presently, Congress/Opposition is not in a position to establish that BJP is getting rich at the cost of people. Just saying Rafael is a big corruption or Chowkidar Chor hai will not do. I wouldn't be all that shocked if that official who was hit too garlanded him LOL. Servility is limitless in our society. Vow! Garland the criminals, rapists, mob lynchers, murderers!!

The fascism guffaws at its forward march!

State power (And also its managers, administrators, political managers, who are rewarded through promotions, money, posts, petrol pumps, etc; and a ""reactionary"" section of the mass) follows the diktats of fascism meekly and voluntarily.

"Mamata Refuses to Attend Modi's 'One Nation, One Election' Meeting, Says Issue Needs More Time.",127,c2avhc,https://www.news18.com/news/india/mamata-banerjee-refuses-to-attend-one-country-one-nation-meet-called-by-pm-modi-says-parties-need-more-time-2192013.html,124,1560937189.0,,thisappear,Politics," ""One nation, one election"" system has both merits and demerits:

Pros:

- Reduction of cost of conducting elections. The EC need much less resources if national, state level and local elections are held simultaneously.

- The political parties need to spend less money for campaigning. Campaigning for every two years is better than once in five years.

- Less disruption of government services, education and healthcare due to regular elections.

- Less violence and loss of life in states like WB or Kerala.

- The ruling parties could take long term approaches due to increased gap between elections.

Cons:

- Local issues could be overshadowed.

- Smaller and regional parties could become irrelevant.

- It would be easier to manipulate. Time? It simply shouldn't happen. 

What the hell? Apparently the opposition isn't opposing this strongly? [removed] One Nation. One Election. No democracy. Unless they amend constitution to a form of presidential government simultaneous elections will be non starter. Bring in Presidential form with term limits i am all for it. Even in US there are national elections every 2 years not counting special elections . What time is needed? it saved money and it saved people time and will increase participation, hence this  must be implemented asap. To all those saying BJP is doing this because they want to become the ""ultimate party"", BJP is not going to remain in power forever. They might lose in the next election. So whatever advantages this system provides will also apply to any party that comes to power in future. We keep saying Congress is irrelevant, but they are not gone, they are just on a low right now. They have every opportunity to bounce back if they find an able leader. If this ""one election"" thing gives an advantage to the national party, Congress can take equal advantage whenever they come to power next. So it can't just be that BJP wants to hoard power, there must be some other intentions as well. [removed] Cons for corrupt politicians for one India one election:

1. Less Blackmoney will be used in Election, Currently big parties need to use their blackmoney on every  election and sometimes EC caught them.

2. Lot of non-BJP/Congress people are coming to the power.

3. Heavy loss to dynasty of political people who is ruling on our country from 70+ years.

4. Their children's future in politics is not so safe. I think overtures by the Govt and majority party to participate is welcome. These small minded leaders should put aside their egos and work for the people. Mamta‚Äôs is so out of touch with her people and reality that it is not even funny.

Inb4 the ""there's no casteism in India"" or ""Britishers created caste system"" crowd chime in. Sounds like something Brahman Samaj of India would do Release?

Its already released! Brhamin samaj: this movie does not potraybus in positive light, ban the movie.
Also Brhamin samaj: we still practice untouchability as our forefathers did. Hit on target Just watched it, the movie is a must watch. Tells the cruel reality of how things are. No wonder some people want to stop the release of it. Some people can't face the reality... I saw the trailer for ""Article 15"". It looks very similar to an English movie ""Mississippi burning"".

 The plot sounds similar too. Article 15 is about castiesm in india and MB is about the racism in America. That alone isn't why it seems similar. Many scenes looked similar there are some characters that also feels like they were taken from MB. 

But this isn't to discredit Article 15 in any way. Even though both topics are same , it's both about bigotry and discrimination. 
The movie looks good and other than the surface similarities it could be very different. The trailer might be made like that so other fans can also see where the inspiration came from. Has anyone seen Article 15?

"Child marriage, sati were abolished, so why not triple talaq?",115,c3he7e,https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/child-marriage-sati-abolished-triple-talaq-1553940-2019-06-22,102,1561184547.0,,JamburaStudio,Politics," Now that a ""non-secular"" party has the absolute majority in LS can we get please get UCC ? How is this still a debate when the court has already said they won't recognize it and legally the couple will still be considered married? 

There are already laws against wife abandonment and not paying maintenance which is the right of every wife irrespective or religion. I don't know what the point of all this is supposed to be? You think the MPs that oppose the bill are in favor of triple talaq? The problems lie within the technicalities. 

For instance, the BJP seeks to criminalize triple talaq with a jail term of up to 3 years? What even is the point of asking the husband to stay with the wife and then jailing him? How is he supposed to provide for her. The govt won‚Äôt provide any economic/legal support to the women except for an allowance which is poorly defined. Is she supposed to live off her allowance for 3 years? And with her children, of whom she is granted custody? 

Second, the SC ruled that triple talaq is invalid but the bill they brought says the opposite, it says the marriage is no longer valid and hence the man is liable for jail term. This goes against the SC ruling. 

Third, marriage is a civil contract between two people and if triple talaq is invalid (as ruled by SC) then the man is essentially deserting his wife which again is a civil matter under all other religions. Ironically, modi is guilty of the same thing. Why punish Muslims for the same crime differently?

Fourth, the bill allows any of the close relatives of the wife to file a complaint without consent of the wife. This was basically done as a reaction to the so called love jihad. 


Muslim women have been treated unfairly for years, and Muslims (men) deserve the blame 100% but this bill is just another attempt by the BJP to further try to marginalize the minority community without addressing the real problems. They don‚Äôt give a flying fuck about Muslims and this is just an attempt to fuck the Muslims even more. These problems are off the top of my head, I‚Äôm sure someone who‚Äôs well versed with the legal system can paint a full picture of the problems with the Bill.

https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/nda-govt-tables-new-triple-talaq-bill-in-lok-sabha-amid-protest-by-opposition-1561127610417.html There is no need to ban triple talaq. The government should just not recognise the divorce unless it‚Äôs done through proper legal channels. Why was a Hindu code bill introduced instead of a Universal Civil code? 

Nehru's original ""secular""-sin Triple Talaq is something that Islam itself traditionally frowns upon. Scholars warn against it and it's generally strongly disliked. Its sole purpose was to serve as a remedy for the *really* troubled marriages and some historians believe that it was originally granted by the Prophet as a means for the 'women' who were married to the most despicable men so that they'd escape that relationship as soon as possible. But, as often tends to happen with most well-intentioned laws, people managed to find the loopholes and favored the 'letter' of the law over the 'spirit' of the law. And as such, most Muslims would be absolutely okay with the illegalization or nullification of triple talaq, but more on that towards the end.

Speaking of laws and women, Islam is the first religion in history to have given women 'rights': social rights, ownership rights, inheritance rights, marriage rights, the right to initiate divorce, the right to remarry, the right to be a witness and give testimony in matters requiring the same, the right to do business (the Prophet's first wife, Khadijah, was a wealthy merchant herself), the right to fight in battle and many many more. Fourteen HUNDRED years ago. 

But, over time, some Muslims twisted the teachings of Islam to suit their own purpose, misused and downright *violated* the very laws of Islam protecting the sanctity of women's rights.. And, over time, it also became okay for the rest of the world to somehow always find a way to judge the 'entirety' of the Muslim community and religion based on the examples set by these worst of Muslims, who are completely unrepresentative of both Islam and most Muslims. 

Anyway, before I digress, coming back to divorce.. So, more than 1400 years ago, Muslim women were granted the right to initiate divorce through the legal sharia process referred to as *'khula'*. (This when women around the world were either burned at the stake for wanting rights or had to promise to be married to the same man for seven lives or had to throw themselves into the pyre with him when he died.)

This is what the normal, the more 'preferred' mode of talaq (divorce) looks like: It's supposed to be done in three stages, over a period equaling roughly three months, and only after the grounds for it have been firmly established (infidelity, adultery, betrayal, loss of affection, etc). Even this 'normal' form of divorce is only meant to be the 'last resort' when nothing seems to have worked to save the marriage. The first month, provided the grounds for divorce are not major (infidelity and/or adultery) and if there is the slightest hope for reconciliation, both the spouses are encouraged to find common ground and rethink their stance, the second month, once again, is time for reflection and possible reconciliation, and only at the end of the third month, when *all* attempts at reconciliation have clearly failed, is the divorce deemed to be finalized and can the spouses part ways.

Anyway, THAT is the 'normal' approach of going about divorce in Islam. And surprise surprise, THAT is how most Muslims actually go about getting a divorce. Most Muslims, too, generally hate the idea of triple talaq. Remember, it's *supposed* to be an absolute last-resort measure, *if that*. Here's a report based on a survey which found that of all the divorce cases amongst Muslims, a mere '0.3' percent were identified as those performed through triple talaq. Less than 1 percent. 

https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/unimportance-of-triple-talaq-supreme-court-muslim-law-4678304/

Yes, 0.3 percent. THAT is how low the incidence of triple talaq really is. Let me just say it once again so it really sinks in. ZERO POINT THREE percent. 

But, how many of you knew that? Or rather, how many of you were led to believe that 'most' of the divorces among Muslims happen the triple talaq way? Or that it's so prevalent among Muslims that 'millions' of Muslim women are simply abandoned by their husbands within seconds? Or that it's because Islam itself encourages it? Or that it's because women simply have no rights in Islam to begin with? 

Many, if not everyone. 

That brings us now to the second, the hidden yet the more important part of this discussion: the 'politics, propaganda and Islamophobia' aspect of it. 

If you could time-travel to today's India from ten years before, odds are you'd find it barely recognizable. 2019 was supposed to be the year when we were just a year away from the watershed moment we dreamed of that would forever change our nation's destiny. We were going to be a developed, happy, prosperous nation, the vision of APJ Abdul Kalam come to life. 

But, it's safe to say that that dream is much farther from being a reality *today* than it was ten years ago. And however unrealistic or unattainable that dream may have been to begin with, I am sure nobody in their wildest dreams ever imagined an India where a 'terrorist' would be elected to the parliament and become a 'lawmaker' in 2019.

A deeply radicalized, bigoted and easily manipulated religious majority has set the country back by many many years, if not decades. Such is the level of toxic propaganda and such is the intolerance of the truth that nothing and absolutely nothing seems to have the potential to stem the flow of this madness anytime soon. 

And it is in this backdrop that it became possible for a man who abandoned his mother, abandoned his wife decades ago and presided over riots that saw hundreds of women get brutally killed and thousands get raped, to rise to be the 'messiah' for Muslim women and their rights and for everyone else to buy into this whole charade. 

And this allowed everyone to believe that the 'logical' solution to correct the injustice of triple talaq was to 'jail' the man for three years based on a report filed by almost anyone, keep the woman on a measly welfare fund for the same duration, keep her children far away from their father and, thus, eventually, to 'save' the marriage. 

If you still think that the triple talaq bill, in its present manifestation, is anything other than a deeply hateful, vengeful exercise of power through which to punish Muslims for, well, *being* Muslims, you clearly are on the wrong side of history. 


https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/triple-talaq-bill-a-cannonball-that-can-bring-down-an-entire-household-118010100141_1.html Because Muslims > ""People who are opposing the bill are not worried about the condition of those women who have been suffering due to the archaic rule. Do they know what happens to Muslim women who have been given talaq? I am a living example of how difficult life can be. There is no sustenance or shelter,"" she said adding that some people were more worried that if the law was passed men who practice Triple Talaq will be punished.

> Ishrat, who has now joined the BJP, says every MP should come forward to pass this Bill. ""This is not about politics, it is about women's respect, their rights. This is not about Muslim vote bank. Even dreaded Hindu traditions like Sati and child marriage has been abolished. They too were against women, so why not Triple Talaq,"" she added.

A victim of triple talaq actually asked the question. She joined BJP because of this bill. ""Liberals"" claim the bill is because BJP hates Muslims. So Ishrat Jehan, one of those who got triple talaq and filed the petition in SC, hates Muslims now? Whereas those speaking mouths who did jack shit till Ishrat Jehan and others filed the case and won somehow have more credibility?

Don‚Äôt think this is new, this is the exact pattern every lynching/attack on Muslims and Dalits has proceeded. 

Remember the gurgaon family that got beaten up? An FIR was filed on them. 

https://amp.scroll.in/article/918410/new-justice-of-new-india-the-mob-attack-on-gurugram-muslim-family-follows-a-sickening-pattern

From that article

> It is a sickeningly familiar pattern. In almost every case of hate crime and lynching the Karwan e Mohabbat has followed, the police have registered complaints against the victims, charging them with cow slaughter, animal cruelty, violence, even rash driving. The victims are often jailed. So, instead of fighting for justice against their attackers, they become preoccupied with marshalling their own defence. In time, the police or village elders broker an out-of-court ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù: the victim will claim not to recognise their attackers and in return the police will not pursue the criminal cases against them.

The family had to leave their house and move to a different village at the end. 

Pehlu Khan‚Äôs death was not the end of his family‚Äôs misery. It‚Äôs only the beginning. What I said in the other thread.

>Chutiyatic move by a moronic government. However much you suck up to Hindutva, the bhakts are never going to vote for you. They have a bhakter alternative.

>So grow a spine and uphold the values you claim to espouse idiots. Next, he will be arrested for making people lynch him. **Update 1**: ***This is poor reporting as Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot himself has clarified that Pehlu Khan has not been charge-sheeted.*** [‚ÄòPehlu Khan‚Äôs name not in charge sheet submitted by cops,‚Äô says Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/newsindia/pehlu-khans-name-not-in-charge-sheet-submitted-by-cops-says-rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot/ar-AADBLG1).

**Update 2**: The Rajasthan Congress CM also clarified that the police probe against the victim's family had been ordered by the former BJP government. [Alwar lynching: ‚ÄòProbe carried out by BJP govt,‚Äô says Gehlot](https://www.asianage.com/india/politics/290619/alwar-lynching-probe-carried-out-by-bjp-govt-says-gehlot.html).

> **The Chief Minister assured that the accused will not be spared**. *""Accused must be taught a lesson so that no one commits such crime in the future,""* Gehlot added.

--------

The issue is that these laws exists and if they exist then the police have no choice but to apply it, especially if it is brought to their attention or they are ordered to ""investigate"" under these law.

There is no ""soft / hard"" *hindutva* here. Remember that the accused have the political backing of the RSS / BJP. The supporters of the accused claim that the victim was transporting cattle and thus they were ""justified"" in attacking him to save ""gowmatha"". 

And it could be very well true that the victim was transporting cattle for slaughter. Obviously that does not justify the violent attacks against him. But if it is true, the police unfortunately have no choice but to file an FIR and investigate this matter too because of the laws:

> The chargesheet accuses Khan and his sons under sections 5, 8 and 9 of the Rajasthan Bovine Animal (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 1995 and Rules, 1995.

> ... *‚ÄúAfter complete investigation in the matter, offences under section 5, 8, 9 RBA Act has been proved against accused Irshad, Aarif and Pehlu Khan while offences under Section 6 RBA Act has been proved against accused Khan Mohammed,‚Äù* states the current chargesheet filed against FIR number 253/17 of Behror police station, Alwar.

> ... Section 5 of the Rajasthan Bovine Animal (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 1995 and Rules, 1995 pertains to prohibition of the export of bovine animals for the purpose of slaughter and regulation of temporary migration or export for other purposes.

> According to Section 6, the transporter is also an abettor and is liable for the same punishment as the person committing the offence. Section 8 is about the penalty for such offences while Section 9 mentions punishment for causing hurt to a bovine animal.

Also note that just because the police believes there is a case, doesn't mean the accused are guilty - a court determines that. Muslims should never place their faith in Congress. Congress has always betrayed Muslims. 

Ask those numerous innocent Muslim youth who were in jail for many many years in fake terrorism charges arrested during Congress governments. 

Read the report ""Torture"" - Indian  State‚Äôs  Instrument  of Control  in  Indian  administered Jammu  and Kashmir by Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons(APDP) And JammuKashmirCoalitionofCivilSociety(JKCCS) to know how the Kashmiris were tourtured in the most inhumane and unimaginable ways during the Congress governments.

There are many many many examples.. How is the cow which was involved in the incident ? Congress is truly a B - Team of RSS. They may not actively kill Muslims, but they will protect those who kill them. The ground reality in India is sickening. People who espouse secular values, and I am referring to the INC here, are as casteist and communal as the openly communal sangh based groups. Political parties are catering to the lowest common denominator of the society and encouraging behavior based on non-liberal, isolationist values. Unless we as Indians accept the reality of our wretched casteist existence change will not happen. All our so called education won't undo the harms which have led us to the current state. If we continue to do the same things which we have always done we shouldn't expect anything different to happen. This lynching squad should get most severe punishment under the law. But it doesn't free the victim from his crimes. /s Typical behavior of Congress and left parties. They used to  take votes from dalits and the stab dalits in the back.

Intentions matter, fuck the results. I just wanted to make a general comment here. Health insurance from a health care industry prescriptive does more harm than good in the long run. One of the main reasons US health care system is so messed up is due to private health insurance companies.

https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/survey-79-million-americans-have-problems-medical-bills-or-debt

*""As of 2007 41% of working-age Americans‚Äîor 72 million people‚Äîare struggling to pay their medical bills and have accumulated medical debt over time up from 34% in 2005""*

When you initially introduce health insurance to a general population that never had insurance before, it is beneficial for both the company because they have low pay outs (profit) and it is great for the person who bought the insurance because they have low premiums and they get good coverage when compared to the premiums they are paying.

Hospitals see's that they can charge insurance companies more than they would usually charge a normal individuals so they start preferring insurance patients. Hospitals also realize they can make a higher profit when they focus on reactive care than the pro active care they were initially doing. Everything/everyone in the industry starts following this tread.

Over a period of time, the insurance pool base (people) get older/sicker and insurance companies start increasing premiums. To make up for this insurance companies starts to add people which just makes the situation worse.

Luckily for India the Central Government has a strong hand in medical education so this allows for high volume of medical personnel to graduate every year where they received medical education that can be seen as ""affordable"" for the most part, especially from an international prescriptive.

The Indian government also runs hospitals which ensures prices are not gouged by the private hospitals.....

Private hospitals are more than welcome to compete with government hospitals (they employ doctors/nurses who come from government run med schools) **but there is no need for the Indian government to subside private hospitals in India thought ""insurance""**

Pushing Indian citizens to go to private hospitals by using government health insurance is like a guy dying of hunger being told by the government to go to a private restaurant and that the government will foot the bill because the government does not want to clean up the government run canteen ...lets see how well that will work out


Any country on the planet with a good health system has an active government run healthcare system/involvement

Within a government supported health system private hospitals are just icing on the cake at best

**I publicly challenge anyone that supports privatizing government hospitals/systems in India to show one country that has s a 100% private healthcare system that is functioning well...and when they cant produce this info they should be shot for trying to cripple our nations health care system**

BJP trolls are trying to push this healthcare voucher bullshit system, it is just a mask the hide the de-funding of government institutions under guise of better financial viability. BJP is pushing this privatization of government institutions to benefit their rich friends. People in India wont understand this until their water bill skyrockets and they get jailed up in private prisons for minor infractions and has to be bailed out using a private bail bonds system who charges cut throat interest rates as it is done in the US. 

Healthcare in the US is a prime example of how private healthcare has totally failed the population. This idea of ""subsides"" for treatment already exists in the US, its called Medicare/Medicaid. Both are filled with waste, corruption, and has helped cripple the healthcare system in the US.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_fraud

The current government is trying to sell of Air India...and private companies are waiting with open arms...because Air India can be made profitable if manged properly...not because they want to buy a government asset to help the government. 

**Only way to improve healthcare in India is to improve the existing frame work of government hospitals/clinical/medical colleges which has been built up over the last 70 years.....very few countries has such a well set up system the way India has....it just needs to be improved upon not solid of to the biggest buyer.**

On a final not I am not a communist...I have written extensively against communism in my last 3 years worth of posts...and yes we are seeing the ill effects of run away capitalism in the west; America is a prime example.

India should learn from other countries mistakes not replicate them to be seen as ""modern"" Reddit called this two years ago. There wasnt enough money in the scheme for patients. it was just a bonanza for hospitals and insurance companies. 

guess who started an insurance company and a couple of hospitals?

Further given the number of criteria to be eligible

Households having motorized 2/3/4 wheeler/fishing boat
Households having mechanized 3/4 wheeler agricultural equipment
Households having Kisan Credit Card with credit limit above Rs. 50,000
A member of the household is a government employee
Households with non-agricultural enterprises registered with the government
Any member of household earning more than Rs. 10,000 per month
Households paying income tax
Households paying professional tax
House with three or more rooms with pucca walls and roof
Owns a refrigerator
Owns a landline phone
Owns more than 2.5 acres of irrigated land with 1 irrigation equipment
Owns 5 acres or more of irrigated land for two or more crop season
Owning at least 7.5 acres of land or more with at least one irrigation equipment

only ghost patients will be eligible for this . From what I understand, apparently these govt. doctors get a commission for sending each patient to a private hospital. Once there the private hospital is given a free hand to rack up the bill as far as they can knowing well that the govt. will just reimburse them later on. 

What these idiots did was create ghost patients whose treatment happened only on paper. Had they just referred real patients, everything would've been legal and they still would've made a good sum of money. 

But my point was you can see the obvious fundamental loophole in this scheme. Basically this is an Insurance scheme to channel public money into private facilities. Public facilities are further weakened in a situation where private providers are already dominant. On the other hand, private providers are assured of a steady clientele. The dominance of the private sector is particularly worrying in a situation where neither quality of care nor its costs are regulated

When in reality it is the govt. Hospitals that need this money the most. Alas as public hospitals are starved of funds the private players are given more incentives to set up shop. Prosecute them mercilessly. Isn't it ironic how we were supporting doctors just last week for getting beaten up? Is it really a surprise that the poorest of the poor with no other recourse resort to acts of violence against the system? > Doctors loot funds meant for poor in Ayushman Bharat scheme with fake bills, bogus treatment; probe on

English + Mother Tongue + Aforeign language is my preference. I wish I had the option to learn Southern languages before moving South. I'd have preferred to have learned odia, or bengali rather than sanskrit too. Other than English nothing should be compulsory.  But then there's not going to be so many options besides hindi English and sanskrit are there. ofcourse the three language formula is a farce. A fraud and a way to impose hindi on non hindi speaking states. While Hindi speaking states have an option to choose their third language, others don't. They are literally forced to learn completely foreign language like hindi while hindi speaking people choose in most cases Urdu or Sanskrit as their third language which is very similar to their own language. Either hindi speaking states should be forced to learn one of the southern languages, bengali, odia or non hindi speaking states should be given the option to choose. Most ridiculous thing in this entire situation is hindi speaking people migrate in waves to southern states and then chid the southern people for not knowing hindi. Really? Do you go to Europe and America and expect them to know your language or you learn theirs? Better option would be to make all three language a choice and nothing mandatory. Outside India no one speaks Hindi....it can be only used in India.. forcing people to study Hindi is agents freedom to take decisions.... 22 Language should be available in all the states and students should have to choose which is better for their future.
I remembered this language forcing problem was also made by modi 1.0 gov.i think it's a type of propaganda that modi (mr. India/first invisible prime minister of india) do to divert from the real issue like joblessness economy etc and he win one way or another way. It's a fair argument, let's see where it goes. Hindi is pushed by BJP government because of the assumption that native Hindi speakers are too dumb, too stupid & too lazy to learn English or other Indian languages.

The fact that many native hindi speakers are illiterate kinda validates the argument. Alas, other Indians are being made to suffer because of this :-( The more I read articles like these the more I fucking hate Hindi.

All your Aadhar fears are coming true in Assam,98,cc5mmo,https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/aadhaar-fears-coming-true-in-assam_in_5d26956be4b0cfb59600624f,24,1562931304.0,,bhaagmodibhaag,Politics," For a second I wondered, What's Didi doing in Assam? This is the digital dictatorship. You dont need to march on the roads , just use police and agencies to do surveillance and monitoring and ensure total control From the article
>The biometric enrolment of those Assam residents who were not part of the draft NRC (announced on July 31 2018), and those whose citizenship had been contested, ‚Äúwill be distinctive and a separate ID will be generated‚Äù, the court said. When the final NRC was published, those included in the final list would be allotted Aadhaar numbers.



>Chima pointed out that creating an identifiable Aadhaar number is dangerous as the data can be easily used to target people, in the case of NRC, poor, dispossessed people from minority communities.

In a nutshell, this means the people whose citizenship is contested will have an Aadhar number that is not a random string - but starts with  indentifiable number(s).  This is where the problem lies - this number could be used to discriminate in the future. I don't understand how adding bio-identification any different from your name, address or any other detail. All the government has your passport, driver licence and voter ID. If they want they can find you easily just with these.

I think adding bio-identification will only improve the security of such cards its almost impossible to fake it.

I agree that all of the databases should be properly encrypted and police or govt. allowed access when only necessary. So Aadhar is being used to identify citizens from foreigners.

A clickbait site decided to paint it as a scare-mongering story about privacy.

Now, people who barely read the text of the article are all getting worked up ! I think this is the logical step to take in this case. Illegal immigrants are a problem in Assam and a big exercise of NRC is carried out and illegal immigrants are identified. Now what these immigrants could do is move to other states and settle there and avoid arrest/deportation. As BJP has promised nationwide NRC to find out such immigrants they would not want to keep identifying the same people again and again hence a database is required. The database has to have biometric data as it is relatively easy to clone another form of ID and create a fake one from it. 

I feel that this can be and will be used against citizens someday by someone. There is no doubt that a Cambridge Analytica type of thing can happen and will happen. 

Another argument that this and all the future governments will give is they need data to identify people who need or may need the help of government schemes which is valid to some extent but if you give someone a magic wand and expect them to do only good then you are a fool.

The only biometric database I feel should exist is a database of convicted and on trial criminals in major crimes like murder and rape.", i_heart_water planet_jupiter bhaagmodibhaag notmefr MrJekyll lynching_specialist

Villages have been killed during the Lalu raaj in Bihar. Even today, when Tejashwi addresses media, he uses the word ""tumlog"" for medis, like the media should accept him as the crown prince. The opposition must leave their comfort zone and fight for real problems. If you analyze the polling data, you would be surprised by how the well-established Caste equations of last 20 years just vanished in thin air, onto which the opposition in Bihar was relying on.

I know/believe that this breed of most of the opposition leaders have grown up entitled; hard-work and being humble is not their suite. India needs a new breed of opposition leader, the current cohort of Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh, Tejashwi are not going to make it. 

The big name websites are trying to sweep the elections in few words such as ""Envy and Hate"", ""Dark Soul"", ""Hindutva"", ""polarization"", ""anti-elitism"" and what not.  The victory of BJP is less about these negative connotations for half the voting junta, but more about the sheer amount of hard-work, enthusiasm and energy of ground-cadre. The voters, whose caste-affiliations stood steadfast till 2014-15 have suddenly annihilated that divide. You will find people enthusiastic for Modi everywhere, but most of the Congress supporters doesn't seem to believe in Congress. It was expected that after SP-BSP tie-up, BJP won't get more than 35 seats in UP, but that's not what happened, right?

BJP won UP in last vidhaan-sabha elections and they kept the lead in 2019, but Congress was wiped out of Gujarat, MP, and Rajasthan despite winning there just 6 months ago. Even RaGa had to chide Ashok Gehlot for his putra-moh. How is the lack of initiative and action on oppositions' account makes the voters ""dark-souled""?

I am sure that violent and extreme Hindutva has not won the country although it may seem so, but the hard-work and sheer modernization of election campaigning in India by BJP has won. Pragya Thakur is a terrorist and she doesn't deserve to sit in Parliament, but the electoral equation of one seat doesn't define the electoral equation of rest of the ~350 seats. 
 
The day opposition brings in a leader who created an energized ground-cadre, whose advisers know each vidhaan-sabha by emotion and by number, who has visited as many villages as humanely possible, the violent Hindutva will be thrown out the door by same people being accused of ""dark-soul"". Till the time we have this weak and uninspiring opposition, the election machinery of BJP will steer itself to victory whether they support violent Hindutva or not. 

Let me add, people wanted Kanhaiya Kumar to win? Why? Because he can talk on TV? If Kanhaiya wants to win, he needs to learn from Smriti Irani. For next 5 years, can Kanhaiya kumar shun the media spotlight, the high-profile speeches and work in Begusarai? Can he visit villages and sleep in dilapidated jhuggi-jhopadis, can he create a network of ground-cadre? Will he stand with people of Begusarai for their problems? Can he fight for the poor, who don't have easy access to clean water, and whom nobody gives any ounce of respect? If he is back to the same media drama and speeches, instead of working his ass off in Begusarai, he was not worthy of a win in 2019 and he will not win in 2024. 


I hope for a strong opposition and the current state of opposition is pathetic. The journalists should do better than to define almost half a billion voices by one word, they need to tell stories of men and women who are not seduced by violent Hindutva, but still voted for BJP en-masse.",batmansayshello,Politics," true,

On some show on NDTV they were showing that Amit Shah visited Bengal 70+ times in the last 5 years to rally the base/Workers...

He Visited All constituencies in India  at least twice..I am not sure rahul baba even visted Amethi, It is a badly run constituency...

Jagan walked thousands of Kilometers and visited all panchayats to win Andhra.

Learn something from chikara and Jagan..rahul baba should just go on a padyatra of India or something,  move from your seat, do something. There was nothing about the opposition that people were looking forward to.Rahul could not deliver 270+ seats.Everyone and their grandmother knew this.You would have ended up with a coalition government at best.I still have nightmares of Third front and it's regional satraps running the Govt as per what benefitted their state best Everyone here bitches about ""BJP IT Cell"" but at this point, if you don't have a competent IT Cell as a political party, you're not doing your job well. 

I was particularly disappointed at the people here lapping up the narrative that BJP won because they had better marketing and more money. As if raising money and getting your message heard are NOT a part of a political party's core job description! The opposition has been outclassed in strategy and BJP has made them look like analogue politicians in a digital world. 

INC was purely relying on their status of ""natural party"" to lead India where once in a while people vote for someone else but after a 5 year term INC is back. 

They had no strategy and were extremely relaxed just ""expecting"" to win because they're congress and a Gandhi was leading the party. 

BSP-SP were relying on caste politics which BJP absolutely crushed. We can talk about whatsapp university, media, electoral bonds, etc until the cows come home but the truth is the opposition was completely gassed and had no strategy.

The fact is BJP had an energised cadre to get the message out where as INC didn't. The leadership needs to change from the top down. Throw out the Gandhis. They might lose another election but it'll be good for the country in the long run.

BJP struggled against regional parties which tells you everything about this election. Regional parties had an ideology, a motivated cadre, and a proper leader. Opposition especially Congress needs an ideology first something which can provide an alternative to Bjp's hindutva but today the identity of Congress has been reduced to one family they need to expand their horizons. People here don't want to accept facts. The election wasn't fought and won on just 2 or 3 most discussed factors like TINA, national security and Hindutava, performance factor played a big role. BJP's welfare schemes for example played a very huge role. BJP found a way to deliver somehow and people rewarded. RaGa was willing to give bigger dole than BJP but people still voted for BJP. 

Opposition as well as people that want to support the opposition need to realize that elections aren't won on just few issues. This realization hit the media when the results started coming in. You can't win more than 60+ seats again in UP just on the back of Hindutava and nationalism, considering the demography there. Modi and the government had to have done something very right that they captured the popular imagination so well. You shouldn't brush off the win by calling everyone stupid. Hopefully the opposition and their supporters understand the actualities otherwise it's way too easy of a road for BJP going forward. BJP is far more professional, organized and strategically more powerful as its backed by RSS. They claim they are right wing, but most of their policies are very much left leaning e.g. toilet scheme, electricity scheme, Ujjwala scheme, PM Kisan, Ayushman Bharat, PM Awas Yojana, etc. All of these targeted for poor and worked very well on ground. And their entire team did excellent work on marketing it. Even demonetization & 15L/acct *jhumla* were also part of that game plan. All of this converted into votes! For avg voters' mind, all these schemes are coming from the *Center* and who is at the center?

BJP already preparing for 2024 and they could project AS for the PM's chair if they win in Bengal (2021) & Delhi (2020) and retain all other state election, particularly UP 2022. I don't think opposition has any unity or any alternative narrative. Congress, being a dead horse, will waste whole 2019 thinking whether to keep RG and then will retain him. Divya Spandana's AMA over here is enough to understand their incompetence. There is the TINA factor in LS elections. This time it turned presidential style, which was unexpected. BJP was trying for this for a long time and failed then.

There is the lazy, unimaginative opposition as you mentioned. They do not have the aggression required. Or even a clear vision or a convincing ability to execute anything.

There is the hard work factor. But then Gautam Gambhir won. And so did several others who did nothing. So it increases your chances, that's all.

There is a shift towards the Right way of thinking about the nation. Is it a permanent shift? Perhaps. Probably. Seduced by violence, no. Seduced by the potential for it and the threat posture it presents, of course. You may disagree. For example, stresses and tensions between communities lead to polarisation in most of the country now. (And then there is kerala where such tensions lead to more cohesion among those not seduced by it)

There is the massive financial advantage BJP enjoyed thanks to electoral bonds.

Media advantage - the top TV channels are all BJP mouthpieces, the liberal channels are at the bottom end.

Just putting it all out there. Yogendra Yadav had a good take on the election results (as usual). He refused to peg BJP‚Äôs victory to an acceptance of Hindutva, but rather to the absence of anyone worth paying attention to: ‚Äúif not Modi, then who?‚Äù If I find the link, I‚Äôll edit to add this.

Looking at the results, though, I think there were several people who voted tactically for the Congress. I think my dad did too. This was bad in Delhi, where Atishi Marlena (AAP) pulled in third despite her track record of doing brilliant work for education in Delhi.

Do I think Bhopal condones terrorism? No. I just think people really fucking hated the opposition. Seriously, what the hell does the average Indian have against air conditioning? Why is using AC considered entitled and derogatory? We are a fucking hot country. Anyone who can use AC should use it if they want to live and work without extra headache.

I am a student and thus I dont have much money. All I get is 3000 rupees as pocket money per month from my dad for all my college related expenses. I opened a zero Balance account in SBI in 2015. Two years back Modi govt and SBI decided u have to have minimum 3000 rupees average balance every month. Now this quite a large amount of money to maintain for an unemployed student like me. Even if you try to maintain 3000 rupees they keep on deducting this and that as ""charges"" And your balance would eventually become less than 3000 rupees and you would get penalised for having a balance less than 3000 rupees and downward spiral would begin. Even back in 2017 and 2018 when my family was going through financial crisis and my cousin would send money from usa to support my education, I would instantly  lose 100 rupees as soon as the money entered my account because SBI deducted ""charges"" Of around 10-30 rupees and that means I have to withdraw one 100 rupees note less. 100 rupees down the drain every single time money entered my account. That way atleast SBI ate more than 2000 rupees of mine in 2 years. Now, I stopped keeping any balance in SBI and have recently opened a DBS account like a week back. Problem is, a friend owed me some money and he sent it to me on google pay. SBI was my primarily linked account because I had some server problems while linking my DBS account. The amount was 250. He sent me they money at 11am yesterday on Google Pay. Now, the money didnt even get credited on my account till midnight yesterday.

EDIT : For people claiming these are just small fees and bank needs to do business. SBI collected 5000 crore rupees ONLY on Monthly Average Balance between 2017-2018

Though always zero savings give us a rupay card, which isn't supported at many places.

Digi bank , provides mastero/visa with zero savings. 

They rob, we can't do much about it. Are you sure that yours is a zero balance account? If it is then there's no way you will be charged for Minimum Average Balance (MAB).

Trust me on this. Go to your branch, have your regular account closed and if you want a SBI account then open the zero balance aka Tiny account from customer service point near the branch. If you don't want to keep an account then good riddance for you.

You as a customer need to understand the product you have been handed over. Take a minute of your time and see what product type your saving account is and type that in google you will get all the info you want from the official website. If you have further query you can PM me. I had posted about this when this was implemented. A lot of students in primary school lost their money. A lot of farmers lost their money. I lost 300 when I had only 1000 in my account during a crucial time.

  


SBI earned about 200-300 crores from this. And then they suddenly changed the penalty for minimum account balance in like six months. Earlier it was about 100. Now it's less.

  


Feels almost exactly like a scam. Implement this kind of stupid rules when in need and revoke it when it deems fit. > I would instantly lose 100 rupees as soon as the money entered my account because SBI deducted ""charges""


 I think you need to check T&C these are wire transfer charges assuming your cousin is sending USD no bank converts currency for free If you wish to avoid the Minimum Monthly Balance charges, please inquire about the Basic Saving Bank Deposit Account (BSBDA). You might need to close your current account and open a BSBDA with your branch. It doesn't have any minimum monthly balance requirement. 

[SBI LINK FOR THE BSBDA](https://www.sbi.co.in/portal/web/personal-banking/basic-savings-bank-account)

Hope this helps. Open an 811 account with kotak Open an account with Indian Bank. Their services are top notch and they only have 500 as minimum balance. Heck their debit card works online internationally without any hassles. 3,000 MAB is not applicable on Student Account (as long as you are student). Did you provide your student i-card to open the account? 

&#x200B;

Instead of rant on reddit, I hope that you post this to banking ombudsman after filing complaint with SBI (get complaint number or zerox of complaint letter) as well. They still have a zero balance account with what seems like no fees : https://www.sbi.co.in/portal/web/personal-banking/basic-savings-bank-account

Switch to that. There was a time when SBI earned more from penalties on MAB than recovery from NPAs. I maintain 3500 rupees and switched to DBS bank for all my day to day activities.

The packet had ""electronics"" written in the memo and was properly sealed . But when she opened it it was not the product ordered.

She filed a complaint and for a refund to Amazon on the very day and here is the exact reply they gave after almost a week:

""I apologize for the unpleasant experience you've had in this regard. On checking, the issue was escalated by the concerned team as per the investigation results, correct product address. Hence, we'll not be able to provide refund/replacement for this order. was delivered in intact condition at your We appreciate your patience and understanding in this regard.

Nothing more can be done and it is probably a complete loss of the 5k rupees but I am making this post mainly to bring it to the notice of the people that stuff like this happens and to probably record a video while unboxing packages delivered from e shopping websites.

I recently ordered 20 packets of Indomie noodles from a seller which was not Amazon fullfilled, fortunately I got what I ordered, though it took 9 days to arrive I've had a few issues of wrong product deliveries to me from Amazon. They've gladly taken it back every time. Once they gave me a big tub of aloe vera gel instead of shampoo. Delivered the shampoo the next day but never picked up the aloe vera gel.

Once they sent me a guitar case instead of the slippers I ordered. Which is strange because I had been thinking of buying a new case for my guitar (never searched for it on Amazon though). I kept the case and never told Amazon because slippers were 300 bucks but case was 1800 lol This is why you should always pay using a Credit Card, since you can always perform a chargeback.

Only difference being he got a 11000 rupee printer instead of the 2000 rupee thing he ordered. Amazon is refusing to take back the item. Send an email to Jeff Bezos at jeff@amazon.com and somebody from their escalation team will respond. Also, make sure you tweet this post to their handle. 

Customer support and social media escalation teams are  different at Amazon. No matter how many times you talk to customer support, they'll parrot the same response. The escalation team can probably help with your case. I wouldn't really blame amazon here completely. 

First of all, you should have bought from a reputed seller, not from someone who has 43% negative feedback as someone else reported in this post. 

Even if you had to buy, you and everyone else should record a video while unboxing just for the sake of the proof. 

You do have to understand how amazon works. A ton of people must try to raise a false complain of receiving false/empty box so it must not be possible for them to refund in each case unless you provide them with some proof.

Big Pharma's greed has destroyed many many lives. People like Dr. Yusuf Hamied are a rarity and a blessing for the poor and developing countries. We're also lucky that Indian patent lows were reasonable and past 
Indian governments did not bow to the money and power of Big pharma, long may this tradition continue! For those interested, do watch the documentary - *Fire in the Blood*. 

It talks about how pharma lobbies deprived the third world countries the medication for profiteering, against the cost of millions of lives.

It has interviews from Yusuf Hamied, UN health experts, activists and other industry figureheads, and covers the topic from a global perspective. Its really a must watch.

Its available on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/in/title/70268209) and also a pirated version is there on Youtube.


From the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_in_the_Blood_(2013_film\)):

> Fire in the Blood is a 2013 documentary film by Dylan Mohan Gray depicting the intentional obstruction of access to low-cost antiretroviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS to people in Africa and other parts the global south, driven by multinational pharmaceutical companies holding patent monopolies and various Western governments (above all those of the United States, European Union and Switzerland) consistently doing these companies' bidding. The film details how the battle against this genocidal blockade, estimated to have resulted in no less than ten- to twelve million completely unnecessary deaths, was fought and (at least temporarily) won. 

> Fire in the Blood features contributions from former US President Bill Clinton, intellectual property activist James Love, global health reporter Donald McNeil, Jr. of The New York Times, HIV/AIDS treatment activist Zackie Achmat, pioneering generic drugmaker Yusuf Hamied, former Pfizer executive-turned-whistleblower Peter Rost, Ugandan AIDS physician Peter Mugyenyi, and Nobel Prize-laureates Desmond Tutu and Joseph Stiglitz.

> In November 2013, Fire in the Blood set a new all-time record for the longest theatrical run by any non-fiction feature film in Indian history (five weeks). It was also the first Indian non-fiction feature to be theatrically released in either the US or the UK.

Losing money in the share market is on me but indirectly it was because of the whole ILFS fiasco.*

I'll try to summarize this whole situation in short and simple before it gets too boring and how it affects all of us directly or indirectly. I will not even try to be technically correct because then I'll never finish typing this but I'll try explaining the important stuff in layman's terms.

**What is IL&FS and why have I never heard of it before this whole thing?**

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Leasing_%26_Financial_Services) \-*""Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS) is an Indian infrastructure development and finance company.*

*It operates through more than 250 subsidiaries including IL & FS Investment managers, IL & FS financial services and IL & FS Transportation networks India Limited (ITNL). Its projects include some of the largest infrastructure projects in India including India's longest tunnel, Chenani-Nashri Tunnel, which was opened for traffic in April 2017.""*

The reason you never heard about them before is because financing and participating in infrastructure projects all over the country is generally boring stuff and doesn't make the news. It's not like trying to reach Mars or launching the next big consumer tech product.

**Major Shareholders** \- Approx % (source: [Shareholder report 2018](https://www.ilfsindia.com/media/2383/ilfs-shareholding-pattern-as-on-march-31-2018.pdf))

1. LIC - 25%
2. Orix Corporation (Japan) - 24%
3. ILFS Employees Welfare Trust - 12%
4. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority - 13%
5. HDFC - 9%
6. Central Bank Of India - 8%
7. State Bank of India  - 6%

As you can see, big chunk of it is owned by LIC, employee trust and Indian Public and Private banks. Not to forget these are direct shareholders who will see fall in wealth because of lost value of ILFS and it's subsidiaries. Lenders to ILFS will lose a lot of money too.

&#x200B;

**Major Lenders -**

[(source)](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/banks-have-20000-cr-exposure-to-ilfs/article26282929.ece)

Multiple Public and Private sector banks are exposed to ILFS and are at risk of not recovering thousands of crores they've lended. These include Bank Of baroda, State Bank of India, Bank Of India from public sector and Yes Bank, Kotak Mahindra, Axis Bank, HDFC and IndusInd from Private sector.

&#x200B;

**Liquidity crunch** \-

Liquidity crunch basically refers to inability to pay debt and debt interest because of lack of Cash and cash equivalents. ILFS group had overall Rs. 91,000 Crore+ of Debt in its books. But to service it, it does not have the liquidity. This it is not that ILFS is saying it has lost all money. They would lend the money for infra project to others which they would receive later on along with interest and some profit depending on the project as shown in the books but in reality these were close to turning bad debts which couldn't be recovered.  ILFS said they've got assets and receivables to cover the debt and debt interest but they are unable to realize them and make the payments. They defaulted on the payments multiples times.

Like you've given your friend a 20k loan which he used to buy an antique item which 'might' be worth 20k or more and he should be able to sell it to pay the loan back on the due date but he's got no cash at that time to pay the dues and he's finding it difficult to sell the antique item. He's kinda not broke but he's not able to make the payment. Not the best analogy but I think it does convey the point. It is a lot more complicated than above because of inter-company loans, defaults, asset-mismatch and cross-shareholding.

&#x200B;

**Scam** \-

There isn't an exact amount for scam (or at least I couldn't find it with decent source and explanation) like you see flying in Nirav Modi or Mallya case. But in a forensic report by Court appointed Grant Thornton India (one of the big accounting services and consulting firms ranking after the BIG4), they've concluded saying the the Committee Of Directors made up of Co-founders, Managing directors, Chairman and other directors were aware and participant of mismanagement, misappropriations of company funds and fraud. It should be in thousands of crores of misappropriated funds though. ([source](https://www.moneylife.in/article/why-the-delay-in-action-when-gt-report-pins-responsibility-on-cabal-of-four-at-ilfs/56535.html))

So company borrowed money from the banks and other lenders and used it for purposes other than stated when borrowing, not following the industry and govt. rules for the benefit of company directors and third parties. Then in the end they were like "" sorry we can't pay back the debt haha its fucked up"".

**Incompetence of Public institutions** \-

SFIO ( The Serious Fraud Investigation Office ) has openly called out RBI for not taking action against ILFS on time.

[From Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/sfio-says-rbi-couldve-acted-faster-on-ilfs/articleshow/69626233.cms) \-*‚ÄúAction  at the right time may have prevented ballooning of the matter,‚Äù the  SFIO said in its chargesheet on the IL&FS matter. ‚ÄúIt is observed  that RBI had repeatedly pointed out noncompliance with the group  exposure norms and wrong calculations of net owned funds (NOFs) in its  inspection reports for the year 2015 onwards.‚ÄùNo penalties were imposed during the period and subsidiary IFIN was  allowed to continue operations without any corrective measures, it said.  ‚ÄúIt was only in November 2017  (that) the classification of group companies in order to arrive at NOF  and credit to risk assets ratio (CRAR) as per RBI Act was strongly  conveyed to IFIN,‚Äù said the chargesheet, seen by ET.*

*‚ÄúRBI  should conduct an internal investigation as to the reason for the delay  and take appropriate action and also take suitable policy measures to  prevent such fraudulent action,‚Äù it said.*

LMAO so RBI could've taken all this seriously, performed their duties and maybe the situation wouldn't have been so bad. There is no sense of accountability and clear display of incompetence but an internal investigation should suffice I guess.

**Statutory Auditors** \-

First let's get a little background on auditing, auditing firms and their work.

Auditing services is dominated by the **Big 4 - EY, Deloitte, PWC and KPMG** around the globe and in India. These MNC companies offers everything from Auditing to consulting and advisory services for all industries, functions and sectors. These are huge companies with thousands of employees in 100s of countries. After the big4, comes Grant Thornton and BDO. They are big but not anywhere near the size and power of the BIG4. The BIG4 is like a oligopoly. Name any top Indian/MNC company and  high chance one of these 4 will be their auditors.

Deloitte and its member firms were the auditors of ILFS group company along with EY. Auditor is appointed by the shareholders and report to the shareholders. An auditors job in simple terms is to give their opinion on whether the financials statements made by the management show a true and fair view of the company. So when a company reports it had 20,000 thousand crores of revenue but 5,000 crores of net loss, it is the auditor's job to verify and give their opinion whether these figures given by the management are true or not. FYI, ILFS had 200+ subsidiaries and different subsidiaries can have different auditors. These are generally smaller but reputed Indian CA firms.

Now, the amount of work done by the auditors to give their opinion, the scope of audit, audit remunerations, cross-selling services etc can be topic of debates for some other time. But here it seems like Deloitte team had a good idea that ILFS was not operating like it should, the financial statements did not show the true position of the company, that they had serious corporate governance issues and they still provided a clean audit report for multiple years. This makes the Deloitte team a culprit in this mess. Also, just to add auditors are generally not changed by companies so frauds can do undetected for years. Deloitte had been auditing ILFS for around 10 years. EY was bought in as co-auditors only a year ago iirc. It was the auditor's job to report that cashflow issues were gonna pop up sooner than later but they failed at reporting this.

&#x200B;

**A Joke that caught my eye** \- **'Evergreening of Loans'**

[(source)](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/il-fs-case-deloitte-turned-a-blind-eye-to-ifin-s-evergreening-of-loans-for-10-years-finds-probe-1559968561218.html)

One of the ways the ILFS management cooked its books with Deloitte is referred as 'Evergreening of Loans'. It sounds so stupid but turns out it was very effective lol.

Basically when ILFS financed a project by lending, they would have to show it in the books as amount receivable at a later date (asset). They would continue to lend money for projects where they knew they'll never recover the money (for personal benefits maybe) and when the time of recovering money came and the other party couldn't pay back the amount, ILFS would have one of their own subsidiary companies fund the defaulting party who would then in return pay the original ILFS lender company. This way they never had to show these loans as NPA (non performing assets) in the books which would've had a negative effect on its profits and led to shareholders question the management policy of lending money to defaulting companies. Deloitte engagement team knew about this according to the emails in the linked source above but failed to act.

Simple yet effective trick.

&#x200B;

**How all of this affects you** \-

It all leads to loss of investor's and taxpayers money. It was the taxpayers money that the government uses to fund government banks which gives loans to shitty companies who never pay it back and the banks record it as NPA.  If you directly held shares in any of the public/private sector banks, they would've reported a loss on these lendings to ILFS leading to drop in their profits and their share prices. If you held shares in ILFS group companies directly, you were fucked.

If you invested in Mutual funds who bought the bonds and securities of ILFS which they defaulted on, you've lost money. If your mutual held stakes in ILFS or any of the banks which lended money to ILFS, you've lost money. Check your mutual funds to see their exposure to IFLS group companies.

If you invested in other NBFC companies like I did in DHFL, they've been under lot of pressure and scrutiny. Raising new money has become more difficult to service their debts and I feel DHFL is going to die a slow death like Jet airways. I hope it doesn't.

Thousands of people will lose their jobs in projects funded by ILFS, in ILFS group companies and in companies directly affected by ILFS crisis (banks, lenders etc).

If only the company management had done their job ethically or had the auditors pointed this all out on time or had the authorities been a little more vigilant, maybe all of this would've ended in a different way.

\--------------------------------------------

I tried to cover as much as I could as fast as I could. I'm sure I'm not 100% correct with everything here but I just wanted to put this out. Grammar maaf kardena pls.

EDIT - Thank you for the Gold and Silver guys :)",hfsyou,Business/Finance," Sharing this podcast on IL&FS scam: http://www.seenunseen.in/episodes/2018/10/22/episode-91-ilampfs-and-the-indian-financial-system I too thought the same. I don't think many people apart from Investors/Builders/Lenders fraternity even know about the extent of ILFS crisis and how it has affected them. DHFL too is in mess.

Construction industry is in real criris in India right now. Projects worth 4.51 lakh crores are in delay (in 7 major cities only) due to lack of funding, demand slowdown and weak economic sentiment.
 https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/5-6-lakh-housing-units-worth-rs-4-51-lakh-crore-facing-delays-in-7-major-cities-report-1497492-2019-04-09 The print media is covering this, newspapers like the Hindu, IE, Mint, Businessline, Business Standard etc covered the crisis. Its just that the TV Media is so useless in India that they dont focus on anything that is remotely boring or wont give TRP's, partly because their margins are so thin that they dont even bother with basic journalism ethics or editorial practices. They have few people on ground and their numbers are reducing day by day. So they only focus on headline grabbing news and if the content is less, they resort to cooking shit up like conspiracy theories etc. But i agree its a massive problem that should be on the frontline of every media outlet. I think the reason no one's talking about it is because there is no will to solve the problems and it isn't just one government to blame, it's all of them. The system's been corrupt for so long it's slowly started to break. THANK YOU FOR THIS POST.There were a few posts earlier on the IL&FS scam but no one seemed interested.Hopefully this post becomes an educational mega thread with details on the dirt Privatisation of gains and socialising the losses.

Until and unless the big wig executives are put into jails immediately , this trend of misappropriation of funds by banks and companies will continue. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. SR Batliboi (EY) has been banned from auditing banks for a year by the RBI. I don't think even a small part of the population understands the technicalities behind this elaborate scam, let alone knowing what auditing and Big4 firms are. Hence, no mainstream media reports on it. Thanks for posting this. I posted the livemint article few days back, but got no response. 

I'd point a few things, as someone who's worked in this industry.

>Like you've given your friend a 20k loan which he used to buy an antique item which 'might' be....

The terminology is a bit off. It wasn't a gamble as implied the value of an antique item. A better way to understand would be to say you lent 20k to your friend for his future transactions. He however, ended up utilising to repay his old debts/skimming off and now can't service your debt since he didn't even start the transaction. 

ILFS indeed has the projects that can keep it going. The problem is funding to keep the projects going which would let them realise the proceeds from such contracts, since they are based on phases of work done. Almost all of the ILFS's work has been halted which makes the situation worse.

>There isn't an exact amount for scam (or at least I couldn't find it with decent source and explanation

There isnt. Since every account would need to be examined for the possible exposure, not even sure how anyone can figure out the amount.

>LMAO so RBI could've taken all this seriously, performed their duties and maybe the situation wouldn't have been so bad. There is no sense of accountability and clear display of incompetence but an internal investigation should suffice I guess.

RBIs primary sources of information is the reports furnished by auditors and the details provided by the respective bank/nbfc. Since the auditors are reputed, there wasn't much of a reason to worry too much about security basis their clean reports. The information provided by ILFS in this case couldn't be trusted, however, there was no way of knowing it. 

Not saying RBI doesn't share blame, but these scams are extremely hard to detect as these are done on individual accounts basis. The system is prepared for the norm, not the exception. Same was the situation with PNB/Gitanjali case. Nobody knew that level of exploitation was ever possible.

>It was the auditor's job to report that cashflow issues were gonna pop up sooner than later but they failed at reporting this.

Since you mention you are new to this field, you'll soon learn about materiality. The article lists out cases which were in Deloitte's mail. However, they form an extremely insignificant part of the bigger picture when seen individually. Having been an engagement member at an NBFC, there's plenty of shit going around, but these are not that matter, as long as they are extremely insignificant. It would be unfair to say that the auditors were complicit with the fraud, since there is no proof yet other a single file in over 6 months of investigation. Also, the group's structure is way too complex to be absolutely certain about nature of every intra-group transaction.

Again, not defending there practices, just stating why the process is so slow and we don't hear about it everyday, everytime, despite its impacts.

As an end note, do make a mention about their new board who tried to immediately navigate out of the mess, which led to huge decrease in media coverage.

We also have brewing pot in DHFL :( These auditing firms are a scam. They are so useless and out of touch with reality of running business that I cannot even say. We had to declare one of a big account as fraud during forensic audit because he ""diverted"" a few lac from his CC account to other stuff. His turnover was 6000 crore.

>* **Two**, due to the liquidity stress faced by developers, the company claims it has been **unable to realise cheques relating to ‚Çπ16,487 crore worth of wholesale loans**. This raises questions about whether the write-off of ‚Çπ3,190 crore taken by the company this quarter covers its entire stock of doubtful loans.

The spectacular fall of the man who founded Saravana Bhavan
By AFP | Updated: Jul 04, 2019, 10.35 AM IST
3-4 minutes

P Rajagopal's story has it all: rags to riches, the visionary creator of a trailblazing Indian restaurant chain -- and having a romantic rival murdered after some fateful cosmic advice.

On Sunday, the founder of Saravana Bhavan, the eatery found in India and beyond -- from Leicester Square to Lexington Avenue via Singapore, Sydney and Stockholm -- is due to begin a life sentence.

Rajagopal, 71, always dressed in white with a strip of sandalwood paste on his forehead, is the pious son of a low-caste onion trader from a village in Tamil Nadu.

In 1981, having opened a grocer's shop in Chennai -- then known as Madras -- he took the brave step of opening his first restaurant at a time when eating out was unusual for most Indians.

The winning formula was, and remains, that the southern Indian vegetarian delights on offer -- dosa pancakes, deep-fried vadas and idli rice cakes -- taste homemade, and are affordable.

""If a lower middle class family wanted an outing, a good treat, a place to celebrate something, Saravana Bhavan was the choice,"" GC Shekhar, a journalist in Chennai, told AFP.

""This man sort of democratised restaurants.""

The concept spread beyond India, with around 80 outlets abroad today catering mostly to the homesick Indian diaspora in the United States, the Gulf, Europe and Australia.

He also treats his staff generously, giving even the lowest-ranking employees benefits like health insurance. In return, they adoringly call him ""annachi"" (""elder brother"").

Alongside Hindu gods, the restaurants invariably have two pictures of him on the wall: one with his sons, who now run the business -- and one with his trusted spiritual guru.

But his beliefs, by no means unusual in India, proved to be his undoing.

In the early 2000s, Rajagopal reportedly took an astrologer's advice to make a fateful decision -- to take as his third wife the daughter of an employee he had his eye on.

""He was obsessed with her,"" D Suresh Kumar, another local journalist, told AFP.

The young woman in question was already married and rejected his advances, but Rajagopal is not a man used to taking no for an answer.

Threats, beatings and exorcisms directed at the woman, her husband and her family over months all failed, and in 2001 -- after one failed attempt -- the husband was murdered on Rajagopal's orders.

In 2004, he was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years. On appeal, he was convicted of murder and the sentence increased to life, a decision then upheld by the Supreme Court in March.

He is meant to surrender by July 7 and spend the rest of his life behind bars.

""Rajagopal is an example of how you can really come up in the society through hard work and thinking out of the box,"" said Shekhar.

""What led to his downfall was his weakness for women and his belief that he was so powerful that he could get somebody murdered and get away with it."" If only he had entered politics this would all have been swept under the rug. Oooo I got money , since I have so much money I am invincible , nobody can fucking touch me now hahahaha.
I am sure I can murder a guy here and there and then marry his wife , what could possibly go wrooooong! Lmaao

What a sick mentality > We eat outside and exclaim 'ah good homely food'. If so why eat outside. 

This comment cracked me up real good my god I remember reading somewhere that he rubbed off the earlier CM of TN in a wrong way, which hastened his arrest and judicial proceedings. Not sure if the source was accurate. Would anyone know more details on this? Monster It took just 15 years *after* conviction for him to finally land in jail?!?? Wow.

Boeing's 737 Max Software Outsourced to $9-an-Hour Engineers,44,c6uptn,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-28/boeing-s-737-max-software-outsourced-to-9-an-hour-engineers,24,1561812989.0,,asseesh,Business/Finance," Such a shitty article. It is quite clear they want to fob off responsibility and are now blaming outsourced developers. I'm pretty sure they have none of the critical work. Unethical to use this as a headline when all the Boeing insider claimed was that it was somewhat inefficient without being specific as to what the HCL employees were working on. This is such a BS article intended to shift blame. The issue was a design flaw not an implementation flaw. HCL and other contractors develop to design which is provided by Boeing. Furthermore I'm sure Boeing has their own internal testing to ensure the built product follows their specs, if they don't that's a whole another issue. Either way it was a design flaw not an implementation flaw. > Boeing said the company did not rely on engineers from HCL and Cyient for the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System

Why is this hidden deep inside?

It's still on the hardware guys to rely on a single redundant angle of attack sensor that can fail. Airbus has redundant sensors but does not rely on them to not drop from the sky. Ok, to get started this article sucks, none of the 9$ engineers are assigned project which are of this importance, they are only assigned data related things which are sort of low level jobs.



All the 9$ engineers have a 100$ direct Superior and a 250$ manager, the 100$ one is supposed to monitor every thing assigned, some upto when they pee and which color they pee
The 250$ manager is supposed to make sure everything is fine on a higher level and who is supposed to make sure all the 100$ engineers works well.


This article literally blames the 9$ engineers not the 1000$/hr highest level management who NEVER outsource critical tasks like this, not the 500$/hr middle and upper level management which NEVER suggests to outsource tasks like this, infact they rarely allow remote work for these kind of tasks. The 250$ guys who are supposed to make sure that what delivered is accurately tested and completed upto certain standards before delivery. Not the 100$ supervisor guys who are supposed to do code review and literally point not if there is an extra blank line in the code. But they literally go for the 9$ wage guy.


Once again NO 9$ GUY DOES THIS SORT OF CRITICAL WORK, EVEN IF THEY DO THEY HAVE SUPERIORS PAID 100$ TO CHECK EVERY WORD IN THE CODE. Clickbait bullshit. Indian engineers didn't even work in the boeing software. Way to put the blame on us for a broken QC system. And clearly everyone up to the CEO knew how the software was flawed and if they gave it a green light, how can you possibly blame the developer working for peanuts. - Hire $9/hour contract workers

- Pocket high margins

- Shift blame

- more profit ? That's a whole load of words used to state, quite simply, that Boeing had outsourced some software development to HCL, and that the development process was, at times, inefficient. Maybe Bloomberg should outsource some of their writing to Shashi Tharoor as a word-cutting measure. Concise results are guaranteed. $9 = Rs. 620/hr

1 day = Rs. 4960

1 month = Rs. 99,200

Developers making as low as $9/hour, Bhai is Boeing India hiring? Pretty sure Boeing just does accept components which doesn‚Äôt  meet their Quality requirements.

Boeing is not the only Aerospace company outsourcing to India. HCL is a large tech firm, no way they‚Äôll ever bill their hours that low. Stop spreading nonsense > Increasingly, the iconic American planemaker and its subcontractors have relied on temporary workers making as little as $9 an hour to develop and test software, often from countries lacking a deep background in aerospace -- notably India.


> In offices across from Seattle‚Äôs Boeing Field, recent college graduates employed by the Indian software developer¬†HCL Technologies Ltd.¬†occupied several rows of desks, said Mark Rabin, a former Boeing software engineer who worked in a flight-test group that supported the Max.

> The coders from HCL were typically designing to specifications set by Boeing. Still, ‚Äúit was controversial because it was far less efficient than Boeing engineers just writing the code,‚Äù Rabin said. Frequently, he recalled, ‚Äúit took many rounds going back and forth because the code was not done correctly.‚Äù", krakends prawad aitchnyu jagananna235 platinumgus18 harddisc kadala-putt papa-kehte-the igameon theself asseesh

**IAS officer spiked Karnataka minister's Rs 600 crore IMA bailout plan**

>  Amid swirling allegations that Mohammed Mansoor Khan could not have fled to Dubai without the aid of authorities, it has emerged that a senior Karnataka minister aggressively lobbied for a Rs 600-crore bailout of the IMA founder-owner, only to be shot down by an IAS officer in the government.

> He had earlier this year approached a bank for a huge loan. As the loan application followed the revenue department's public notice on the fraudulent practices of Khan's company, the bank realised that the firm was under the RBI scanner and insisted on a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the state government. 

> Khan, using high-level contacts, almost succeeded in getting the certificate. But an IAS officer refused to sign the papers. The minister, it is learned, exerted pressure on the official of the rank of principal secretary to issue the NOC though he knew the background of the IMA Group and Khan's financial status.

>  A source said, ""Efforts were made from all quarters to make the company appear legitimate and they wanted the government to endorse the company. But the senior IAS officer did not relent.""

Mysureans Invest Rs. 24 Cr. In IMA Jewels

Mysureans have invested a whopping 24 crore (initial estimate only) in Bengaluru-based blade company ‚ÄòI Monetary Advisory (IMA)‚Äô. This has come to light after the Police scanned over 700 complaints filed by cheated investors in Mysuru and calculated the amount mentioned in the complaints.

Yesterday, a special counter was set up at Jabbar Function Hall at Udayagiri close to Udayagiri Police Station to receive the complaints and the complaints are growing by the hour.

Today, the counter was closed due to an event at the Hall. It is estimated that more than 1,500 people from Mysuru and surrounding areas have invested in the fraudulent company.

Udayagiri Police Inspector Umesh said that all the complaints received will be compiled and collated carefully and later on will be forwarded to the SIT in Bengaluru, which is probing the scam.

Also, 199 per day seems low. They claim to have 1500 drivers on board and aim for 4000. Some quick math,

1500 x 4975 (199*25 assuming this is most popular) = ~75 lakhs

4000 x 4975 = ~2 crores

10000 x 4975 = ~5 crores

Doesn't seem bad at first glance and all of this is before taxes. A fixed turnover per month with money coming in upfront is a wet dream for service businesses. But the amount is quite low for an organization of this scale. Assuming a 20 person team plus overheads and infrastructure costs, they will be in losses.

Tl;dr - The 199 is probably introductory price and will increase.

edit - day not month Lora cabs??? How is that sustainable? 

No Surge I can get behind but how does no commission works? Who is maintaining the servers, systems and infrastructure?

Edit. Ok so I read the article - 

> the app-based ride service will not charge any commission from the drivers and they will have to pay just a daily subscription charge whereas commuters will not encounter any surge price.

This is worse than commission. Fixed charges instead of flexible charges are not driver friendly at all.

Just another gimmick. Chennai needs this ASAP. To quote Admiral Ackbar: ""It's.. a.. TRAP!""

We have seen too many of these startups now and their game is quite clear. Use VC money and start with super-low introductory prices at a loss to company to capture a good customer base. When enough customers have joined your service and are no longer using the competition, jack up the price tenfold and add items like ""road tax, service charge, chai/sutta charge, driver's laundry charge"" which makes a Rs. 50/- trip into Rs. 500/-. Bankrupt your drivers and drain your customers' bank accounts, and surprisingly the company will still be in losses. Then get taken over by the only company that's somehow turning a profit, and become the company you wanted to destroy. Cheers.", ForgetPants Holypatchouli asseesh xxwranglerxx the_storm_rider

Quite a lot of apps that help to do this. I use Monefy on Android. Used to use spreadsheets before that. This helps you to know your trend of spending, and when in need, help to plan cuts.

- If you know your major future expenses well ahead, like say a premium, or a specific purchase that requires relatively bigger outlay, start saving for it. You might think credit cards may be more handy. But unless you develop financial discipline, credit cards just amplify your spending habits.

- Since you're just beginning to live apart, you'll still be figuring out your expenses for a couple of months. So don't stress of you're unable to save any. However, you can begin by setting modest savings goals. I began by setting aside atleast 5-10% initially. Look to maintain long term savings for investments and tax planning, and short term savings for emergency/liquidity use /r/FIREIndia may appeal to you. Hey congratulations dude!

Employment at 21! Whoa! Firstly congratulations on the job

take some time to figure out how much is your monthly expenditure, staying alone will add to expenses so dont try and do the saving bit the first 2-3 months, just make sure you settle in correctly.

Post that start tracking your expenses you need to do this for another 2-3 months to have a pattern, once you do that try and cut out what you dont need or you feel you are spending too much on.

If you figure out a number ( minimum you need plus some for expenses ) start an RD with the bank ( you are taxed on the interest earned ) this will ensure you have a saving per month from your salary.

If you get disciplined enough, you should get a credit card with a limit no more than what you can pay in a month, you can game the system if you can pay off what you spend everymonth and get some benefits with the points you earn. 

Start small, save what you can. At 3.5 you can make a few small investments so that you dont pay income tax, please check this out and make sure you dont pay taxes.

These are on the top of my head, will add if i remember anything more.

All the best Congrats for job.

First step : learn compounding before MF ,Stocks Usually, you should save atleast 20% of what you earn. So acc to your 25,000 pm salary, you should save atleast 5,000. You can distribute as below -

2,500 in Large cap MF eg. Mirae Asset India Opportunities
2,500 in Debt funds eg. Reliance or SBI Magnum gilt fund

You can keep rest of amount in any overnight fund eg. HDFC overnight fund instead of in Savings account.", warpedking unicornh_1 DrAwesome04 rmenn throwawaydilliwala poco_gamer

Please suggest what's the legal way to do that. It's a digital product.,MrGogi61,Business/Finance," Depends on your contract. For some companies, the contract essentially says they're hiring your skills exclusively. So you can't use them commercially anywhere else. Another question would be: Is it related to your existing job? For example, you can't make a ticket website startup while you're working at BookMyShow. In fact some companies won't allow you to work on things that they plan to make in the future. So if BMS is planning to build a Food delivery service, your startup can't be a food delivery service. Also sometimes you're not allowed to use company equipment for your personal projects. Needless to say, you can't work on your startup during company hours.

Edit: Forgot to say IANAL How about asking an actual lawyer? Jesus. If you're serious at all, let your lawyer go through your contracts. A lot of times the contract will say anything you work on while contracted to them is their property. Their may also be provisions in the contract that say you can't work in the related industry for a given time period or never at all even. GET A LAWYER. [deleted] When you say we, who is we? 

I am assuming friends, in that case, just start working on it in your spare time without worrying about all the company registration details.

Once your MVP is ready and you have few paying customers then think about quitting your job and registering your own company. That part is easy, getting the first actual paying customer is hard. Check the contract you have signed.

My contract with Infosys stated that any code I write while working with them belongs to Infosys. Non competes are un-enforcable in India.

This happens now and again for various reasons - over production, export bans (Russia and Iran can't import our tea at the moment I think, and they are usually big drinkers of black tea), poor quality of the teas or cartelization.

Most likely they will now try to sell the teas at the Cochin Auction, or try to negotiate a better price out of the auction.

Then you can have a interest free credit period of upto 50 days (depends on card). Check with the customer care and please pay off the amount as soon as possible within that time period. Pay in full. Borrow from some friend. Pay the bill the full. Do not and I cannot emphasize this enough, do not pay minimum balance if you can avoid it. Banks charge around 30-40% yearly interest on these amounts and your credit score might get affected. This would hamper your chances if you wish to take a loan in the future. It's simple Math - pay as much money as you can into the credit card....

Before you spend, before you invest, before you save, first get rid of that 42% per annum debt on credit cards If this is the first time, then it makes sense to borrow and pay in full. No point paying partially when your CIBIL is going to take a bad hit.

In fact, it's even okay if you're paying 3-4% interest to whomever you are borrowing from No issue in ocassionally not payng off credit card in full. However, if you can borrow from someone  at an interest rate less than what the credit card will charge, borrow and pay in full. Don't borrow from a loan shark however - usually rates will be much higher or you will have fees to pay that will make the borrowing expensive. In that case just pay whatever you can pay on the card. Also known as the Credit Card Trap. Borrow or beg if you must, but pay it in full. Minimum Payment Due is one of the most misunderstood concepts.

'*Verghese Kurien once met Sonia Gandhi. And then the Italian bar dancer Sonia told him to make milk using 'Italian' technology.

This daivik tatva, the scriptures say, helps Hindus become more manly and more resistant to foreign invaders. And that's why Sonia Gandhi came up with the evil plan of taking away from our precious gau mata milk the most special ingredient, so that Hindus would lose their bravery and courage and Sonia would establish a caliphate in the Bharatvarsham.

SBI and its Yono App,1675,b8vagb,https://i.redd.it/zdklspxqe0q21.jpg,141,1554308759.0,,barmytitty,Business/Finance," Dude that font though Our resident SBI cum banking liaison officer should answer this Lite is a rebranded SBI anywhere app, probably with some changes. The ux is same, ui is same but colours are different. Yono Lite is actually the SBI anywhere app. I haven't used Yono but SBI anywhere was a full featured app, nothing lite about it. You could most things that you could through the Online SBI site, and with a better user experience. YONO SBI doesn't work on custom ROM. Mainly because of the voice assistant feature in the Yono Lite app I guess.  Lite is bandwidth saving version. Makes sense it has bundled extra stuff beforehand. There is possibility that the lite app will be more efficient at handling login and data. Lite app does not necessarily mean  taking less space in your inbuilt/sd card memory. It most probably means it will take up less space in RAM of your mobile. Secondly OP you have used wrong meme. The meme police is looking for you. It's pronounced 'Oh-no' That font....... Hurts my eyes  Lite app always doesn't mean that they take up less space in your storage memory, albeit there are lite versions of many apps which follow this suite, but the fundamental idea behind lite version of the apps to cater for users on slow networks or poor connectivity and low-end smartphones, which often lack the memory or battery life to load flashier, more sophisticated apps. they often lack data intensive features.", shut_up_chigo 7xbvt OpinionatedUserName seppukuAsPerKeikaku yourrable ppatra Prata2pcs sargasticgujju tekina7 nexistcsgo Outside_Statistician

I hate indian government and its TAX system,464,c75z4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c75z4z/i_hate_indian_government_and_its_tax_system/,312,1561878710.0,"last year in October, I had a great idea to sell my own educational courses online so I can earn some money with college.

As i researched online I found out that I need a payment gateway and I need to obtain GST number, even before I started earning. 

People on the internet were asking 1000 just to register you on gst portal( it should be east like signing up on some website )

so I decided to watch some YouTube video and applied for it and go my GST number as well ( yay )

but later I got busy in college and couldn't work on the website, and I forgot about the whole GST thing.


yesterday I received a letter at my home that I haven't filed my GST return and there will be punishment and charges and I need to do pay the fee within 3 days, I was like but I didn't even started my business and haven't made any profit so what type of fee am i liable to pay?

So appertly you are required to file GST return every month ( some user thought when they opted for quarter return - they were liable to file every 3 month ) 
and the worst about monthly return is that I need to pay late fee for every single one.
Now I'm looking at total of 17000 late fee, for just an idea to test, and I'm feeling like a loser and stupid.
just if I have read about it more.


 I found many small business people online, some needed the gst number for some reason and now they were too looking at this big numbers of late fee.

The thing is I understand I was supposed to file return every month, but I got the letter yesterday after 8 months,  they could have sent an email or a sms? why wait 8 months.

the funny thing is I'm not the only one, people don't even know they supposed to file every month even if you are not making any sell. most of people don't understand who these things works so other people so called professional charge them, tax supposed to be simple, simple enough so general public can understand it. 

The way I see it, it's just a way to feed government. once the government got the taste of money the appetite only grew. ( yes I steal it from some book )


TLDR : registered for GST for a payment gateway registration, forgot about it, haven't file return, now looking at 17K late fee, blaming the govt for sending letter after 8 months but not even a email/sms.",shu95,Policy/Economy," So what you are saying is that you did not read the GST Act carefully or consult a CA before registering for it

The same provision also applies for Income Tax, even if you don't earn Income you are required to file Nil Return once registered

There's a simple procedure online for cancellation of GST Registration, you should have done that the day you decided to drop your business decision

And FYI you need to register for GST only if your Value of Service exceeds Rs 20 lakhs
So why would you Register for GST despite not crossing that threshold?!

Sorry, you are at fault Ignorance of the law is not a valid defence for not paying taxes that are due. If you're going to get a GST registration, atleast read about the basics of return filing ffs. Think of it as renting a house. Just because you don‚Äôt live there, does not mean you are not liable to pay rent. Never mind, it be a good learning experience for you. I wish I was as entrepreneurial as you in college! Best of luck! u/shu95 comes across as the kind of person that goes to a vegan dinner and is annoyed they didn't serve chicken. There is no requirement to register for GST if your turnover is less than 20lakhs. However, once you are registered, you have to ensure various compliances. Op this is your mistake. You should have read the whole thing before signing up. If I sell paid apps on Google Play store, do I also need to register and pay GST? My income through this source is < 20L per annum Welcome to the world of business, if you don't know what you're doing you're going to pay the price. This is in fact why most prefer to work for a salary, the worst that can happen is you get fired.

*ignorantia juris non excusat* - ignorance of the law is no excuse.

This is a line that is taught in any business school as among the first things to know about any legal system. 

There are bad laws in every country, and I don't know a single country where doing your taxes is easy, especially for businesses. Corporate Tax Accountants earn as much as lawyers and doctors because it's a mess of rules anywhere you go.

As someone said, try to plead your case before a competent officer, it's likely you'll be excused. Hi OP, I guess you messed up big time man.

I understand like me, you also don't come from a business family, so we basically lack the guidance needed for running one. 

But this is how business is, it's uncertain.

Please don't let a single incident like this be the reason to be afraid of doing business in future.

One of the things I have learnt in last 2 years is that, in business you should not always do all the work(GST registration in your case) on your own, even if you think you can do it, always outsource it to some fella who offers it as a service, that way you are helping another business and at the same time building your network.

Network is really important, I get over 60-70% business through reference. Almost 6 months ago, you posted saying you do a job in a different state. So college student or job, which is it? > As i researched online I found out that I need a payment gateway and I need to obtain GST number

Anything missing?

um.....

Yeah scrub suit, jot that down too. Wtf? Can they make a case against the institute? Dude...there is a second half of that statement  which states something about affecting the patient. And ain't that the prime duty if any medical practitioner, that the ones they treat never have to come back to hospital again (hopefully)? Of course leaving aside the cases where the patient dies.... This entire thread makes me sad and it's a good thing doctors are leaving this country. 

This country does NOT deserve such high educated class people. Bunk classes till they forget about the undertaking. If you do dharna at all in future you can ask them for proof that you agreed. You docs should learn about ESMA and your institute is teaching you the same in declaration this is legal , also happens in engg clgs The hippocratic oath also asks doctors to take care of their own self being. 

If our safety cannot be ensured in our workplace we have every right to protest. 

Pls note that almost no protest so far has involved the emergency services and has been restricted to the opd

People have taken hard working residents for granted without giving us the most basic needs. You will not get your care if you dont ensure our safety  

And there's nothing in law which differentiates doctors from other specialities apart from esma (which doesn't apply to opd).. so if lawyers bankers labour workers can strike so can we.. OP don't bother posting here. Far too many people here have no empathy for doctors. You'd expect reddit to be a more reasonable place, but the other day, I saw a four hour old comment calling for violence on doctors that make innocent mistakes and instead of being heavily downvoted like any post criticizing any favoured politician, that post was upvoted. 16 up votes.

This subreddit is more or less just as degenerate as the rest of India, which believes that only doctors ought to do their duties and shut up if they're ill treated. Since when did creating ruckus when you are employed become a fundamental right?? Don't see anything wrong with this. Your residency is not a regular college where you have to sit in classes in which if you are striking, no one is getting physically put in danger.

A doctor's primary responsibility should be towards the health of their patients. A patient may enter a critical state while you are out protesting.

Can the government do something about private companies making their employees work for 9-6:30 instead of the usual 9-5 working?,118,ceagx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ceagx9/can_the_government_do_something_about_private/,101,1563384085.0,"Most of the people working in cities like Bangalore,Mumbai have to spend further 2 hours everyday just for travelling.

Also 99.99% of employees in a company will be shit scared that they will be fired if they don't work or ask questions. We have ample of people waiting to just get a job. Then they won't mind if company exploits their soul. Such people will usually replace you if you refuse to work from 9 to 6.30. Companies are reducing workforce and local businesses are dying. Both things are very concerning. I'd ghanta fark ni pdta timing ka, just complete your day worth of work and leave. If you're doing that no one would care if you're doing 10-5. But if still you're told to complete your time, you're are just not at the right place. Or you're easily replaceable. sir, even in PSU there is no such thing as 9 to 5. So sorry to bust your hope.

Work closes at 5 PM but never in past 2 years since i have joined the office. not even one day i left at 5PM. you finish your work and go. 

The status of the government office itself is like this. you are asking the same government to do something about Private offices

Ha Ha Ha Na man govs are stupid they will make some law which will force everyone to follow 9 to 5 , I don't even wake up at 9  , I reach office at 12 can the people maybe organize and rebel out of self care instead of  continuing to be slaves? You can say goodbye to worker protection and rights now. There is increasing clamor for removing labour laws and rights because of perceived notion that it is holding economy and growth back. 

The upcoming simplification of labor laws will further enable employers to exploit because we have oversupply of labor and employees.

##Summary

This policy is easily the biggest change to the education system since the old policy came in. It is in many ways, entirely unrecognisable, while in many other ways, simply formalising what was informally already done.

The first and biggest change, is that primary education, from ages 3-6, is now a formal part of school education, and public school must offer this. The second change, what goes hand in hand, is the abolishing of the 10+2 system. In many ways, the 10+2 system completely ignored the way a student's mind developed, and thus made for a poor learning system. The new system is 5+3+3+4. These stages are as follows:

- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.

- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.

- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.

- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.

The new Foundational stage, is supposedly meant to be ""age fluid"". Your age does not matter, as long as you are within the age group 3-8. The Policy recommends that during the foundation stage there should be no textbook based education, and instead play based and activity based education. It also emphasises on introducing a variety of new ""stimuli"" to force children's brains to develop in a holistic manner. These stimuli include : music (classical or modern, both singing and listening), art (regional, national, sketching, etc.), literature (folk tales, literature from the region, and national quality authors, both modern and classical). This is a massive departure from the present system, and the new emphasis on arts, is excellent. To add to this, a new bilingual policy is introduced. Students who learn languages are shown to have much better cognitive abilities than those don't so the new system makes all students learn 2 languages right from the start. One of these has to be the mother tongue, in order to preserve it. The other language may vary by region and requirements. The three language policy remains, and will be better enforced. The final changes to the primary education, is the integration of ""anganwadis"" into schools, and shifting them from primarily health workers, to full scale trained teachers, satisfying the needs of the students. The NEP requires the full development of people-skills, through a variety of things like weekly assemblies and daily show-and-tells. This improves the speaking ability, something that IMO Indian students have historically been terrible at. New extras include group reading of stories, learning morality and ethics (along with a proper framework), puzzle solving of various types, etc. to make sure a child has a significantly better development. Students who fall behind are not left out, instead the teachers are required to identify and help them, as studies suggest that students who fall back early almost never recover.

The next ""Preparatory stage"" lays emphasis on shifting from a more informal style in the Foundation stage, to a more formal textbook oriented education, in the Middle stage. It is a bridge stage. Please not that the policy emphasises that any and all technical education *must* take place in the native language (mother tongue) first. This is because students who learn in their mother tongue have a noticeable advantage over those who learn in say English. The policy also has a very good write-up on why the emphasis on English has hurt India a lot. The preparatory stage also keeps this focus on arts, and expects students to fully develop other skills beyond the ""textbook education"". The policy also demands the abolishing of the so called ""co-curricular activities"" instead integrating them into the core curriculum. This makes things like PE, yoga, art, music, a core part of the education. It also requires that every student specialise in at least one of these subjects. Another new concept here is the selection of the best students to help the worst students. The best students are selected by the teacher, and then become part of a sort of ""national training system"".

The third stage is the ""Middle Stage"". By this time, the student's mind would have developed enough. It is now time to start the fully formal education. Subjects start splitting from generic versions into more detailed subjects (like science -> physics + chemistry + biology). Students at this point will slowly start to also learn technical subjects in English. The idea is that students will be able to think in their mother tongue (which has a lot of advantages), while being able to understand and present ideas in English.

The fourth, and final stage is the ""High Stage"". At this point, students have developed a lot. Their mind now starts thinking in ""the bigger picture"" mode, and they can start planning for the rest of their life. In order to support this, students are now allowed to freely select courses and specialise. They are still required to understand and complete art courses, as this is paramount to their abilities, regardless of the final courses they choose.

Some important courses that come over the 12 years include : course on ethics and morality, Indian languages and their history and regional literature.

The next major changes come to the school management system. Schools can now form ""complexes"". A complex is comprised of nearby schools, such that each complex as a whole offers all of the above stages. Complexes are then given funds and other resources, like teachers. These resources may then be split up among the schools as necessary. This is important, because some types of teachers are relatively rare, and thus it provides optimal utilisation of resources. Sometimes other resources like libraries may also be shared. The exact details of what is shared will vary depending of the schools and their locality (population density, and ""backwardness"" of the population).

Schools also get a new level of autonomy, that was previously missing. Teachers are allowed to be the final deciders on the courses, and how they will be taught.

In order to improve attendance, the schools will do a number of things. Depending on the area, buses may be provided. Roads will be redone, so that transport is easier. Older students will be provided with free bicycles. The mid day meals will also be extended to offer basic breakfast to students. Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools.

To reduce inequality is a primary goal of the new policy. In order to do this, each school complex will have committee overseeing the demographics, and why students aren't attending. Specific groups called out include Muslims (for unwillingness to attend), and women in general. The policy requires that people of all castes and religions be integrated into the schools. The teachers are also required to emphasise on equality, by preventing acts that discriminate (e.g. not allowing SC/STs to sit with ""upper caste students"", etc.). The schools are required to join with the community in eradicating inequality. They are required to talk with parents and try and change their behaviour. This could be the groundwork to eliminating the reservation system. The policy sets the target of 2030, by which the majority of the students will be ""equalised"", not by pulling down the richer and higher caste, but by pulling up the poorer and downtrodden. Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones. A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from Under Represented Groups.

The next set of changes are aimed at teachers. The primary aims are to improve teacher pay, and status in society. It recognises that teachers are already heavily burdened with a lot of work, so no government work may be offloaded onto teachers. They are also educated better, and stricter standards are set. Teachers are required to ""re-educate"" themselves by joining workshops, and the vertical mobility of teacher is to be improved. Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy.
Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers. Substandard stand-alone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible. New teachers will have to register with an authority, and then will be quickly shifted into a school complex, for integration with the schools as necessary.

The next major changes comes to the testing system. The new system will be run by the National Testing Agency (which was newly set up in 2017 for entrance exams). They will be conducting the tests, and the new tests will be more like aptitude tests.  They will de-emphasise rote learning, instead encouraging an understanding of the subject. The policy claims that by 2020, all schools will have internet connected computers. It thus pushes for some degree of digitisation, by allowing for continuous evaluation through computers. Board exams in 10th and 12th are no longer. Instead we have exams in 3rd, 5th and 8th, called Census exams. The idea is to reduce the importance of Board exams. Teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes.

This policy also paves the way for better recognition of ""top talent"" students. For e.g. if a student is really good in Math, then they will be attending special summer schools to improve their performance. As already mentioned, top students are also required to tutor the students who are have a hard time coping. There is also a new emphasis on Olympiads. This should improve India's ranks in international competitions.

The RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. The RTE act itself will have to be reviewed, as the policy notes.

As for private institutions, there has been some misinformation. Private institutions will have to undergo some changes to have a similar system, so that they too can reach out to all students. The main changes are how fees is regulated. Fees needs to be rationalised, and can't be arbitrarily high. Once set, fee increments must go inline with inflation and reasonable increases, as opposed to random increases. Schools are also now required by law to be non-profit, and must be verified regularly by submitting all of their financial details. Private schools are also prohibited from having the word ""public"" in their name. So be prepared to see a lot of name changes.

Schools will now also be accredited and regulated in a slightly more free manner. However, they are required to release all details to the public. A framework and guidelines for ensuring school safety and security of children will be developed, and will be made a part of the eligibility conditions for a school education institution for recognition and registration. Every principal and teacher will be made aware of the provisions of the relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, etc. relating to child rights, and what constitutes their violation, by including a module in the teachers‚Äô/principals‚Äô education/training programmes and refresher courses. Self-learning online programmes on child rights will be developed for the benefit of students, teachers, and parents. Credible mechanisms for students to report breaches of their rights, and for appropriate actions to be taken against perpetrators, will be developed and implemented, in collaboration with local police. The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme will be integrated into the curriculum of schools in a phased manner. (please note that Adolescent Education Programme is not sex education).

Also, in addition to all this, alternative forms of schools like gurukulas, patashalas, and madrassas will be encouraged, as long as they follow a modernised syllabus and are fully transparent.

The first changes will be implemented by 2020, with most major changes being in place by 2022. The first benefits will be seen by 2025, and by 2030, we should have fully transitioned, with all benefits in place.

##Comparison With the Current System:

The existing system failed primarily in 2 ways: Languages were poorly integrated, and many schools did not even offer three languages, as the policy notes. Hindi speaking states and TN were the primary offenders. Now all students are required to learn languages as per the Three Language Formula. The other way the old system failed was in testing. NCF (2005) laid heavy focus on eliminating rote learning, and in introducing a system where discovery based education was encouraged. The 10th grade NCERT textbook for science is a testament to that. Yet the system failed, because tests only cared about how well a student could mug up and vomit arbitrary facts. The new policy does try to fix this, but how much will improve remains to be seen.

The other more minor ways in which it failed was the integration of ""extra curricular"" subjects. Many schools actually refused to teach these subjects, considering them a time waste. The new system makes them a core part of the education system, so there should be an improvement.

Please discuss, and if you have any doubts, feel free to ask.

##TL;DR:

1. Learning to learn

2. Mother tongue as primary language of learning

3. Focus on trilingual policy, with English no longer as primary language

4. Equality of all students

5. Arts, Sports, Music, literature, etc. are all now of primary importance, and each student has to specialise in one of these, in addition to courses of their choice

6. Digital Education

7. Freedom of choice in higher stage of education

8. Board exams removed in favour of more frequent ""census exams""

9. Testing now to focus on aptitude and understanding, with more frequent tests, a la CCE under CBSE

10. 10+2 eliminated in favour of 5+3+3+4, with full focus on primary (3-8 years) of education",gryphus-scarface,Policy/Economy," I envy the new generation. I'm feeling sooo jealous right now. This writeup is simply superb.

It the posts like this makes me visit R/india. Trust me - none of the media outlets I follow have even given me a hint of these changes. All I hear from them is Hindi Imposition. 

Thanks and Kudos to OP!! Hey OP! You're doing great work bro. Thanks for the tremendously helpful post. 

I'm curious if there are any reforms around higher education as well. Will look up the draft. Wish I could give you gold. I love your detailing both this post and the replies Awesome!! The policy is really disruptive. It completely overhauls the current Indian education system. It touches each and every aspect of child education be it technical, cultural, moral etc. If implemented properly, it would really go a long in ensuring holistic development of children.

One thing I specifically like about the draft is that they are treating educationn as a continuum, not in segments (like primary, secondary etc) like it is right now. Hey OP could you create a PDF of this and the credit so we can then distribute this too those who are not on Reddit. This is great work and I think it needs recognition. Aaah man...this is the revamp our Education System has needed for ages. I hope we are able to see the benefits soon if this system is implemented across the country. 

Am so jealous and at the same time happy for the future generations of India who won't have to mug up textbooks.

Hope we are able to find well qualified teachers who will be the backbone for such a system. The highlights from the document (page 1 to 198):

##Primary Education:

###Understanding:
- Primary education (between 3-6 years of age) is critical for student development. 85% of student development happens in this age, as concluded from studies conducted by NCERT (sample size = 30,000 kids) (referred to as ECCE : Early Childhood Care and Education)

- Students who fall behind early tend to remain so for the rest of their life. Thus ECCE is probably the most important education provided

- ECCE includes health and nutrition of mother and child, along with various emotional and cognitive stimuli, like talking, music, games, etc.

- Crucial self-help skills must be learnt, including most good habits

- Children under the age of 8 do not follow the linear education as prescribed in the current curriculum

- Supervised play based education is proposed.

- Proposal to make everything in education from ages 3-8 one pedagogical unit, called ""Foundational Stage""

- The [Anganwadis system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anganwadi) (under Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)) when well funded has been successful

- Anganwadis don't provide the required education that ECCE demands

- Private preschools largely act as literal pre-schools, simply adding more education

- Private preschools have high Pupil Teacher ratio (PTR) and the teachers generally lack the skills necessary fro quality ECCE education. Don't help in health aspects.

- Majority of Indian students lack ECCE, as verified through studies by Ambedkar University, Delhi.

- Thus art, music, literature, etc. all of which have been historically part of Indian ECCE must and will be added

- Recommendation : include ECCE in RTE

###Corrective actions:

- NCERT scope expansion to include ECCE

- New framework will include details on making cheap toys for quality stimulation of infants (0-3 years age). For 3-8 year old children will have flexible play, activity, discovery based learning, teaching numbers, alphabets, basic communication, etc. Engagement with music, art, literature from India's vast history, including emphasis on regional variety.

- Strengthen Anganwadi education system. At least one Anganwadi worker with full training in ECCE per Anganwadi.

- Co-locate Anganwadis with schools

- Build stand alone preschools in areas where Anganwadis and schools exist

- Since ECCE is equalising, districts with socio-economic disadvantages will get special attention

- No separation on age basis in ECCE. Students from age 3-8 only.

- All of this will shift to under the MHRD or be under MCWD

- New committees in each state including : Cognitive scientists, early childhood education experts, artists, and architects, to design spaces for ECCE education

- Physical infra will be safe and clean, along with access to all basic amenities

- State govt. responsible for making quality educators. Current educators will get 6 month training course

- Everyone need to understand importance of ECCE


##Foundational Literacy and Numeracy:

- Objective : By 2025, every student in Grade 5 and beyond has achieved foundational literacy and numeracy.

###Issue at hand:

- Numerous studies show that students who fall behind here are unable to catch up for years, show flat learning curves

- Large number of students who fall behind in school fall behind in the first weeks of grade 1

- Schooling in the early years also lays too little curricular emphasis on foundational literacy and numeracy and, in general, on the reading, writing, and speaking of languages and on mathematical ideas and thinking.

- Few teachers have the opportunity to be trained adequately for this

- Teacher deployment is an issue

- Nutrition is critical issue

- Impossible for teachers to fix situation. Needs full effort from teachers, parents, schools, policy makers, etc.

- Teachers will be pushed into ""backward areas"" ASAP

- Nutrition and health (including mental and physical) will be addressed

- Urgent national mission

- Expansion of midday meal programme: Both a nutritious breakfast (e.g. even just some milk and a banana) and a midday meal will be served to pre-primary and primary school students. 

###Corrective actions:

- Dedicated reading hours in math and literature for grades 1-3

- Dedicated language and mathematics week

- Regular language and math ""melas""

- Weekly math and language oriented assemblies

- Weekly activities in libraries, like story telling, theatre, group reading, etc.

- Explore connections between real and class math

- Workbooks on language and mathematics

- National Teacher‚Äôs Portal (DIKSHA) will have a special section of high quality resources on foundational literacy and numeracy. Sources from across the country

- National Tutors Programme (NTP) where the best performers in each school will be drawn in for up to five hours a week as tutors during the school for fellow (generally younger) students who need help.

- Remedial Instructional Aides Programme (RIAP) as a temporary 10-year project to draw instructors - especially women - from local communities to formally help students who have fallen behind and bring them back into the fold.

- Instructional Aides to be 12th graduates, or highest available from the region, and will be from local communities. ""Backward community"" IAs encouraged.

- Encouragement of large-scale community and volunteer involvement: ex-teachers, ex-service men, etc.

- Adaptive assessment scheme will be developed

- computer based adaptive assessment first in secondary education, then by 2023, for the rest

- Extra aides to teachers via smartphones, apps and other technology

- Grade 1 students get 3 month long ""school prep module"" to make them ready for school

- Increase parental participation as home environment is important for proper education

- Ensuring proper teacher deployment and teacher conditions, and a Pupil Teacher Ratio under 30 : 1 at every school

- Libraries across the country will increase and expand

- Social workers and counsellors to be hired to work in schools

##Reintegrating Dropouts and Ensuring Universal Access to Education:

- Objective: Achieve access and participation in free and compulsory quality school education for all children in the age group of 3-18 years by 2030.

- according to U-DISE data, the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in 2016-17 for Grades 1-5 was at 95.1%

- access to secondary schools and upper secondary schools remains a very serious issue.

- Socio-cultural and economic issues also play a significant role in dropout rates

- There also remain serious issues of **inadequate infrastructure and lack of safety.**

- students **do not find school interesting or useful.**

- Increasing the intake capacity of existing schools in areas where many students are out of school;

- Building new educational facilities in under-served or un-served locations;

- Consolidating existing stand-alone primary, upper primary, secondary, and higher secondary schools into composite schools

- Better transport facilities, like proper roads, and bicycles for older students, school buses, organised walking groups, paid walking escorts, etc.

- Free room and board facilities in the form of hostels will be built - matching the standard of Navodaya Vidyalayas, for schools with large number of students from far away areas

- Safety is core concern, especially for under-represented groups. Zero-tolerance policy towards breaches of child rights will be adopted to ensure physical and emotional safety of children.

- Transparent system to track attendance, and immediately enquire if students are absent

- Dropouts aged 15 and above, who have fallen too far behind or are nearly illiterate, will be given the alternative option to attend adult literacy programmes 

- To make it easier for both governments as well as non- governmental philanthropic organisations to build schools, to encourage local variations on account of culture, geography, and demographics, and to allow alternative models of education such as gurukulas, paathshaalas, madrasas, and home schooling, the RTE Act requirements for schools will be made substantially less restrictive.

- Extension of RTE to students in age group 14-18 (so students from ages 3-18 are covered in RTE) I'm heavily impressed by the draft if one doesn't talk of the language issue. Now let's hope that the implementation doesn't get fucked over.

Coming to the language policy, if the centre has so much problem with English, they should promote the 23 scheduled languages instead of only Hindi. The problems of giving English too much prominence will still stay, only Hindi replaces English. Rather, more focus should be given on bilingual education in English and the native language. In that way, no Indian community gets an unfair advantage/disadvantage because they happen to speak Hindi natively.  And if the government is so keen to promote Hindi, make it an elective in the 3rd language slot for people who don't speak Hindi natively. An overwhelming majority will end up picking Hindi anyway, because speaking Hindi has its advantages in India. Its imposition doesn't. Bilingual education will also ensure a smoother transition to higher education where the courses are usually taught in English only (for pragmatic reasons). ##Teachers

- Objective: Ensure that all students at all levels of school education are taught by passionate, motivated, highly qualified, professionally trained, and well equipped teachers.

**self note** page 113-117 detail the need and requirements of teachers, along with existing issues they face. Gives very important perspective.

- The harmful practice of excessive teacher transfers will be halted with immediate effect

- suitable NTA test scores in the corresponding subjects will also be taken into account for recruitment.

- a classroom demonstration or interview will become an integral part of teacher hiring

- teachers will often be hired to a school complex (conglomerate of nearby local schools) to ensure there are suffiient teachers for all subjects

- schools and/or school complexes will be permitted and, indeed, supported with suitable resources to hire local eminent persons or experts as ‚Äúspecialised instructors‚Äù in various subjects

- A comprehensive teacher requirement planning exercise will be conducted across India and in each State

- The primary goal of overhauling the service environments and cultures of schools will be to maximise the abilities of teachers to do their jobs effectively

- Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools

- The creation of the school complex as the smallest viable unit of governance will help create vibrant communities of teachers

- teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes

- teachers will not be allowed any longer to conduct government work that is not directly related to teaching (except for rare events that do not interfere with their class work) so as to avoid excess load

- the role expectations of principals and teachers will explicitly include developing a caring and inclusive culture at their schools, for more effective learning for all, and for the benefit of all in their communities.

- teachers will be given more autonomy in choosing finer aspects of curriculum and pedagogy

- Teachers must be given constant opportunities for self-improvement and to learn the latest innovations and advances in their profession.

- Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers.

- Leaders such as school principals and school complex leaders will be have similar modular leadership / management workshops and online development opportunities

- Career management of teachers is an important area of reform to restore the prestige of the teaching profession

- A robust merit-based promotion and salary structure will be developed. A system of multiple parameters for proper assessment of performance will be developed for the same. Vertical mobility of teachers based on merit will also be paramount.

- Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy

**self note** to see the detailed changes tp teacher educational qualifications, see pages 120-121

- Substandard standalone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible

###Effective teacher recruitment and deployment

- Merit-based scholarships to encourage outstanding students to enter the teaching profession

- The recruitment process for teachers will be rigorous and transparent, designed to find the best teachers, instill confidence in them, and be a representation of the high regard and respect in which they and their profession are held by society.

- The practice of assigning teachers to individual schools based on overall student-teacher ratios will be replaced by a much more careful assignment system based on the educational needs of the children.

-  In hiring school teachers, at all stages but particularly at the Foundational, Elementary, and Middle stages, strong preference will be given to local teachers and to teachers fluent in the local language, so that teachers may communicate easily with students, and with their parents and community members

- Teachers will be recruited to the district, as is done now in many States, and then deployed to the school complex, and then, as per school needs, to individual schools.

- Suitable incentives will be developed for excellent teachers to desire teaching jobs in schools in rural, tribal, and remote areas, where they are especially needed.

- Stopping the practice of para-teachers

- Induction of freshly trained teachers into schools. They will register with an authority, and then be inducted and integrated into the school complex.

###School environment and culture that is conducive to quality education

- All schools will be provided with adequate physical infrastructure, facilities, and learning resources, either individually or within their school complex.

- Schools will attempt to develop and demonstrate a caring, collaborative, and inclusive school culture

- There must be no interruption to school schedules so that teachers can use their work time to concentrate solely on and excel at their chosen professions.

- Remedial programmes will be established at all levels to help teachers in ensuring that all students are achieving their potential.

- Rejuvenating academic support institutions (SCERT, BITE, DIET, BRC, CRC, CTE, IASE)

- Teachers will be able to connect to the local community, to encourage self-governance

- Developing high-quality material for teachers and teacher educators in Indian languages, including tribal languages, will be accorded priority in order to ensure quality learning in the local language and thereby the inclusion of all students

###Continuous professional development

- Flexible and modular approach to continuous professional development for teachers

- Revamping continuous professional development

- Self-directed personal development of teachers

- Online resources for continuous professional development

- In-school teacher development processes

- Recognising outstanding teachers

###Career management

- Tenure track system

- Parity in service conditions across all stages of school education

- Professional progression via promotions and salary increases

- Clearly laid out professional standards for teachers will inform career progression of teachers. A common guiding set of National Professional Standards for Teachers (NPST) will be developed by 2022, coordinated by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) and NCERT

- Periodic (annual or higher frequency) performance appraisal of teachers

- Professional progression via vertical mobility

###Approach to teacher education

- Moving teacher education into the university system; the four-year integrated B.Ed. programme

- The two-year B.Ed. programme for lateral entry into teaching

- Specialised instructors for specialised subjects

- Closing down substandard standalone teacher education institutions

- Pedagogical aspects of the four-year integrated B.Ed. programme

- There is an urgent need for additional special educators for certain areas of school education

##Equitable and Inclusive Education

- Objective: Achieve an inclusive and equitable education system so that all children have equal opportunity to learn and thrive, and so that participation and learning outcomes are equalised across all genders and social categories by 2030.

*self note** read pages 138-139 to get historical context on inequalities, along with detailed studies by various institutions

###Upliftment of underrepresented groups in education

- Emphasis on the Policy actions for students from underrepresented groups

- Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones.

- Inclusive education in teacher preparation

- Alternate pathways for recruitment of teachers from URG

- PTR in schools with a high proportion of learners from URGs should not be more than 25:1.

- Establishing mechanisms to address discrimination, harassment and intimidation

- Eliminating exclusionary practices

- Sensitising learners

- Inclusive curriculum

- Up to date information for each student will be maintained in the National Repository of Educational Data (NRED). While some education indicators will be common to all URGs, specific indicators may be tracked for particular groups

- A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from URG

- Alternative means of support besides scholarships

- District-wise financial assistance

- Adequate financial and other resources for institutions

- Funding will be made available for independent research on inclusive education

- Coordinated and integrated policy implementation to support under-represented groups Nice summary; ambitious plan, Happy for the country.

Before levying taxes to promote electric vehicles, the government should have first promoted the ecosystem, allow private players to come in, give them tax subsidy (new business so even at lower tax, the government would still get additional revenue). All they're doing is punishing the common people to promote electric vehicles which the common people won't be able to afford/maintain for atleast half a decade.

Its already happening in HYD. We are paying 6K for 24K liter water tanker every two days. Chalo that settles it - another reason to not bring a child into this world. Government really need to learn from UAE and gulf region they don't have water sources still they manage to harvest fresh water and use desalination for fulfilling water demand. Costal cities like Chennai Mumbai and other ones can implement the desalination Water scarcity in Chennai & Bangalore is already insane. A water tanker for a 10 house building costs ~5K now. Bengaluru has lot of lakes. On my way to commute I used to see a lake. It was surrounded with garbage and filth, I saw some kind of construction, over the course of 6 months it was cleared up and it vanished. There is another lake a few minutes stroll from my office, it is large and surrounded with plastic and filth and people just throw garbage in it. It is dark greenish colour.  I do not know how it does not come to their mind, may be if they do not pollute it and not\* use it as sewer dump, they could drink its water and not die, may be go on boat rides at evening. There is also a lake near my PG. It is also surrounded by plastic and filth and weeds. It will probably cleared in a few years and they will build a mall there. These people  simply can not think what consequences their actions would have on their future. Most people would attack IRL if you said this but they do deserve to die from thirst. They do not deserve any solution. They brought it upon themselves. It is the Darwin award most Indian cities deserve to win. Scary. People are already so full of rage and anger against each other. Such scarcity can be totally disturbing for the society. India desperately needs to transform it's tier 2 cities into tier 1 cities. Our metro cities are collapsing under stress.

And can someone explain how is this a crime? Oh good lord this needs to stop like 20 years ago. Chennai is fucked up like this. A few years ago I went with my wife for work in Chennai. And since we both look somewhat young, when we checked into the hotel, they asked us for our marriage certificate. At first I thought this was a joke. But they were dead serious. This was like at 3 in the morning. I mean who the fuck carries their marriage certificate with them everywhere?

They just wouldn‚Äôt relent. Finally we had to show our wedding photos from our Facebook for them to allow us. I mean seriously Chennai.

Could a Union of countries in the Indian subcontinent have been a solution for all the cross border problems we have had since?,37,cbvqo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cbvqo1/could_a_union_of_countries_in_the_indian/,57,1562880790.0,"So hear me out on this, now there has been a long history of violence spanning the whole sub continent that includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan. This has subsequently resulted in terrorism and insurgency in majority of these countries. 

Wouldn't a solution similar to the EU work for the countries in the subcontinent with all the countries in the sub continent developing quickly, a common currency that can be used in all of these countries (since many if them hold very similar value), a free border for trade and travel that will finish off border disputes, this will reduce tensions between countries aswell.

This would reduce violence and would also keep chinese influence off of the countries in the subcontinent. Make the subcontinent ""union"" collectively much more economically and militarily stronger. Learning from the EU by not making the mistakes they did like no election of EU representatives in the EU parliament etc. Shouldn't the countries in the subcontinent look for a solution like this rather than tokenism of SAARC.",rohanpaul,Policy/Economy," We dont know if it would have woked. Post the devastation caused by WW II , Europe was determined to make it work anyhow. They kind of worked under a principle of ""if goods dont cross the border then armies will"". And all the larger countries  decided never to let it repeat. We never faced that kind of devastation. All the wars we faced have been relatively tame. Hell India and pakistan lost more soldiers in WW II than in all of the wars since combined. So we dont have that kind of political will to avoid war.

There was a proposal that could have achieved what you suggested. The wavell plan of 1945.While Muslim league was amenable to it Congress was not. It had some really regressive proposals it had some plans for a loose confederations with right to secede. First get our own States to like each other and work with each other [deleted] The problem has a geographical aspect as well. None of these countries except us have a common border. it is just a fantasy and will continue to be so . look at saarc, even that did not work out, let alone forming something like eurozone The subcontinent is one geographical entity separate from Persia in the west (Hindu Kush), Indochina (SE Asia) (Patkai, Purvanchal) in the east and China (Himalayas, Karakoram) in the north. We have a distinct identity different from these other regions. The current borders between India/Pakistan and India/Bangladesh are bullshit and are drawn arbitrarily, most of which does not lie separated by a huge geographical barrier (mountain range, lake, wide river etc.). It is only natural that the subcontinent develops strong internal alliances, free trade and open borders towards the prosperity of 'our' people. Points that ensure it will be realistically impossible for something like EU to happen here:

0. Religion: We guys are mostly Hindu, club tiny Nepal and Sri Lanka with us. We are surrounded by Islamic fundamentalists on one side who are heavily invested in destroying us people. The other side's fundamentalists are kept in check by a pseudo dictator. Merging us all will give us a large fundamentalists population which will be absolutely disastrous for average Hindu.

1. We are overwhelmingly big compared to everyone else. Literally, in terms of numbers etc we just will dominate them ALL too much.

2. Pakistani Army: They spend one of the highest GDP % in world on defence. Pak Army and to a large extent culture is heavily based on showing superiority over us 'the kafirs'. They consider themselves genetically superior, NOT S Asian, their military derives inspiration from Arabs, they reject ALL of their actual past.

3. Poverty: Charity starts at a rich man's house. We are individually way way too poor to be able to be benevolent to each other.

4. Presence of sovereignty: Europe is American playground except France. WW2 ensured they would be shit poor like us if USA didn't make them subservient under it. American military is pretty much present in some way in ALL NATO countries, very strongly in EU countries to the point it eclipses host countries. S Asian countries are largely independent with the exception of Pak. There is no overarching force that keeps us all in line.


Secondly the 'benefits' you outlined are wrong.

1. We will NOT benefit at ALL from Pak. In a EU type union we will be required to financially help them, hell no. I would rebel outright against my govt if it actively finances people who are literally hell bent on killing me.

2. Common currency: Again have you seen Pak? They have no reserves, having a single currency will again put burden on us to hedge their market risks.

What we can actually do is what Modi govt did at inauguration, focus on BIMSTEC. We can definitely work with Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Bangladesh. And then improve trade with ASEAN. 

Pak should be continued to be isolated, eventually we need to give up the Indus treaty and divert water in the interlinked river system Futher straining their resources. China will be tired of exploiting them at some time and then further isolation of them will be more possible to weaken them more. Final goal would be building an international sentiment like US did for Iraq that they are unstable country and hence Nukes should be neutralised. A large and controversial part of the EU is that the individual countries have surrendered their sovereignities. This has come about due to the guarantee given by the US via NATO about how they'll ensure their safety. As long as safety of this bloc (both against each other and also against outside threats like China or even the US) isn't assured no country is going to surrender it's sovereignty. Now the only countries capable of this are USA and maybe China a few decades from now. I doubt India will be willing to let China take over control of some facets of our sovereignty and if we don't allow them to do that and reduce our own military capabilities then countries like Pakistan wouldn't feel confident enough to trust in this bloc. The thing about EU is that those people had same religion and ethnicity. All were white while we are not. India is trying to form a union of all south asian countries except for Pakistan cuz pakistan is up to no good and will never benefit us or anyone I think BIMSTEC is the right way of going about it. India is the hegemon of South Asia and this is India's Bretton Woods system with surplus recycling mechanism built in. If we can keep up our growth rate, it will rub off on these countries as well and build a virtuous cycle of supply and demand. In may one day morph into a political union as as well. I'm not of the opinion that the EU has been a success for similar reasons that would be magnified in the subcontinent. First, a union is only as strong as its weakest member, which in this case would prob be Bangladesh, maybe Nepal. If there's any financial mismanagement, wealthier countries have to bail them out (similar to what we see with Germany/Greece). 

&#x200B;

Secondly, it strips individual citizens of sovereignty and more decision-making occurs at the bureaucratic level by unelected officials. For example, let's say Bangladesh can't pay off their loans--normally, Bangladesh could do several things to fix this issue, such as printing more money. Or they could default. Not great options, but ones they could make autonomously. As part of a union, they can no longer do that. So, they appeal to India for a bailout. India says, ""fine, but we want to privatize your water supply in return for a bailout and our companies will be the ones to run them."" You know who gets screwed? Local village Bangladeshis. You know what they can do about it? Absolutely nothing. 

&#x200B;

Third: Richer countries are unduly impacted, too. They're watching their resources go to corrupt bureaucracies run by their neighbors. For ex: let's say Nepal has a power crisis that, if not solved, renders their economy insolvent because nothing works. Bhutan, then, either watches its economy falter because investors no longer want to pour money into the subcontinent's common currency (like the euro equivalent). In order to save its own rear, it has to allocate some of its hydroelectric power to its neighbor even though it relies on generating great money from that power to India. Bhutanese citizens lose because Nepal can't get its shit together. 

&#x200B;

Last: such a union would make the ""haves"" and ""have not"" countries starker in its divide. A union allows for greater movement of citizens and greatly relaxes immigration standards, so, a Bangladeshi doctor is able to take the first flight out and go work in India. A Pakistani scientist decides to go live in the mountains of Bhutan instead. The result is a brain drain from the poor countries over to the richer countries. Some of the best, most lucrative citizens go improve places other than their own. We see this playing out between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. 

&#x200B;

So yeah. Common economic and especially currency unions are a disaster so if any (let alone multiple) countries have weak economies with terrible corruption. I don't know if there's a single country in the subcontinent that would be a good candidate for a broader union.", odiab backagainonreddit None SocioliberalBuddha costaccounting DeadRootsStirring faora22 AncientTravel KaptaanImmi braindead_in ChopinNocturne

The GDP growth rate isn't a worrying figure. A 6.8% 5 year low is hardly a bad thing. Modi was aiming to contain fiscal deficit at 3.x % so there was no room for economic stimulus (given their freebies). The budget that will be released by the new govt is going to be extremely important which is going to determine what kind of stimulus is now possible. 

What is worrying is the unemployment rate. This is going to be one of the toughest challenges for Modi and 6.1% is an extremely bad number.

I can write an entire book why it should be low. It's not the tax rates that bother me the most, it's where that money eventually ends up. It is like the chicken or egg argument. Which came first , people paying high taxes in developed countries and allowed them to develop a high quality infrastructure which persuaded taxpayers to continue to pay, or developed countries having a high quality infrastructure originally which made taxpayers pay on their own?

At a certain point, some generation has to suffer for the country to grow. India has way lower income tax rates than the countries it is trying to become more like.

>All the concessions given to corporates have only helped boost their profit margins rather than employment or capacities.

yeah, a cursory look at result of any of such companies will prove that it is not true. Where are my profits?

Unfortunately they are given because all other countries are giving them too. Its a cut throat market. India can take that away but then they are going to edged out by Chinese and other SE asian competition and we'll not even have whatever piddly industry we have.

Article complains about not increasing allocation to existing welfare schemes but doesn't look at the new schemes are added

I think the government spending could be rationalized better but a ill researched article by an author who already had an opinion before even starting to write this article helps nobody's cause. No, no corruption was involved. If course if would have been corrupt if upa did it. But this is new india. From what the article mentions, this budget's tax incentives were ‚Çπ1.09 lakh crore to the corporate.

Additionally, what the article doesn't mention is that ‚Çπ0.97 lakh crore were also given as incentives to individuals.

The majority of tax incentives for individuals were under Section 80C (‚Çπ0.75 lakh crore) while for that of corporates were under section 32 of IT Act which pertains to accelerated depreciation (‚Çπ0.68 lakh crore).

Moreover, the article implicitly mentions that these tax incentives to Corporates should be used to fund developmental schemes. Should individuals tax benefits under 80C be also scrapped to provide tax benefits then? I don't like tax concessions. It is arbitrary. It has the potential for massive corruption. No matter what tax rate you have large corporations with their resource and connection will be better than small companies at finding such loopholes. It is much better to rather have a low tax rate and offer no concessions. That should help small businesses much more. With this money, they could have saved so many farmers, built so many schools and hospitals, given millions free medicine, water, saved millions of children suffering from malnutrition. Shame on us.

The problem here is not actual or under reporting, but inablity of the system to investigate these cases and deliver justice in a timely manner.

Hoping for pending child rape cases to bundle up in lakhs and eventually someday and somehow we start building capacities to action on them, is a desensitized solution.

At the end, these are children who're sexually abused and they will suffer from the trauma for rest of their lives.

I doubt any Indian Govt. has studied the behaviours of these criminal minds and the impact it has on its victims. Most of our solution and energy is directed towards punishments, rather than thinking also about institutional rehab of the victims.

I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to.

Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",MelodicBerries,Policy/Economy," Based on your summary, (and good of you to make the effort!) the economic survey is goobleydook.

What on earth are they looking to buy?

Windows + Office .edu licenses are cheap as chips. Also Kerala‚Äôs school system will have to pay for the IT overhead & salaries of maintaining their customised Linux, security updates, etc.

This is not to say Linux has no place in schools or organisations. But as the Munich move to Linux (also a custom build) and the subsequent griping about LibreOffice and the move back to Windows shows, organisations have to be realistic in setting expectations in what they can achieve with custom OS deployments ‚Äî in terms of both features and cost. Especially now that it‚Äôs really cheap and easy to deploy Chromebooks and Windows licensing costs for education are quite reasonable (I understand connectivity issues may preclude Chromebooks for Kerala schools). It must be happened in every places of Academia.

&#x200B;

Also, it'll also reduce the piracy of Windows hugely used everywhere.

Windows just give friendly interface but any GNU/Linux OS gives you more freedom of customization.

&#x200B;

I see Windows as OS filled with Bloatware! I am all for FOSS but this sounds fishy as hell.

> From the next academic year, we‚Äôd ply more than 2,00,000 computers in schools and each of these will be powered by the latest version of the Linux-based Free Operating System

> ‚ÄúIf we had gone for applications of proprietary nature, each computer would have incurred at least Rs 1.5 lakh in licence fees,‚Äù

Even if Windows costs 15,000 Rs (which it doesn't), (3000 * 10000000) / 15000 = 2000000, 20 lakh licenses can be purchased with 3000 crores.

Also, Windows education edition is almost free for educational organizations. Let KPMG raid Nehru place lol Nice!

If you are interested in startups check out ycombinator startup school on YT First episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czqfRQ2TdLE The startup show should have started with in-depth coverage of **Startup India scheme** with authorities from the same. *'X startup received Y funding or Z revenue*' is useless information.

&#x200B;

Startup India program deserves credit where its due, it has grown from '*Where is Startup India*' to '*Apply here to get recognised as Startup*'.

&#x200B;

There are still various lingering questions on program eligibility and selection criteria, especially w.r.t to DIPP/DPIIT  certification. This certification is necessary to prove that the startup is  'an innovative' startup to avail certain benefits especially tax break, which can be huge for self funded startups.

&#x200B;

But there is no public information on what is considered innovative by DIPP. What distinction it makes between product/service startups. How  does the selection criteria differ between hardware/software startups etc.

&#x200B;

Then there should be discussions on the policy itself, only when there is an absolute un-biased, factual discourse, a policy in a democratic country can be improved. e.g. Software services export has long enjoyed zero rated tax (GST), what should be equivalent for HW startups now that there are several IoT startups.

&#x200B;

If these resonate with you, please do write to DD  [https://doordarshan.gov.in/feedback](https://doordarshan.gov.in/feedback). Instead of this, govt should make registering company and managing taxes easier for startups.

And yeah, in case they haven't noticed : NONE OF THE YOUTH WATCHES TV ANYMORE. LET ALONE DD. What the fuck is TV show  gonna do to boost startups?? 
Same happened with KisanTV.  They do run informative shows regarding agriculture but India is vast land. Terrain, weather everything changes every few KM's and generalised information that they give on this programs is of no use. Rather they should have ran local awareness program with local agriculture specialist who actually knows and understands the situation in the area. I thought this was gonna be Indian shark tank but doesn't look like it.

Wouldn't a shark tank'esque show have made much more sense instead of a Mann ki baat'esque show? I used to think that startup India is a joke just to take votes.

But so many of them have mediocre careers, not a whole lot of ambition, and no inheritance.

You work long hours in a job you probably hate, then spend hours in commute stuck in traffic and poor infra, eat, sleep and repeat this for 6 days.

Obviously, some people dig their way out of the rut and do something better but not everyone can. Where is the money?

Sab paisa Nehru le gaya!! The biggest problem India has is that they took the wrong things from the wrong parts of the world. Instead of taking the education system of Europe they took the one from US which puts more and more people in debt and gives very little back. Atleast the standard of education in US is good for most institutes, in India the standard is shitty, and yes, the IITs are just as shitty as the rest compared to international standards.

On the other hand they took the work culture of Europe into the govt offices. People have fixed work life and do not work a minute past the time line. Why is BSNL going down? When I was growing up BSNL employees did absolutely nothing, for weeks there would be no internet or telephone connection. This did not happen in the US, atleast not during the time when they were growing like India is now. Capitalism in US was fuelled by tremendous work rate among people back then. The socialism in Europe was helped by the fact the Europeans went all over the world and looted everyone equally.

India needs to change the grassroots, improve the quality of education, follow Europe and make education free, establish a link between education and industry where students are exposed to industry standard early.

*The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) will not allow new conventional disciplines with low employment potential from the academic year 2020-21 and will permit only emerging fields such as Artificial Intelligence and Block chain, Lok Sabha was informed on Monday*

I found this absolutely stupid and against common sense to enforce a policy like this. One needs to investigate the reason for low employment in core engineering sectors such as Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering and so on before dismissing them as 'low employment potential' and jumping on the AI bandwagon. The disciplines supposedly termed as low employment are essential to the development of the countries infrastructure. Bulk of the engineers working in many of the Government PSUs, Government Engineering Research Laboratories such as DRDO and BARC, Indian Engineering Services, and even combat engineers in the army belong to these disciplines! India has never even reached the pinnacle of research in these fields to just dismiss them as not worthy of being pursued any longer. These basic engineering disciplines have always formed the cornerstone of what is considered the very mantle and basis of all engineering. Instead, the AICTE should focus on revamping the curriculum to make it more interdisciplinary and relevant to current fields. 

In my opinion by intentionally creating a surplus of engineers trained in a particular field because of an ongoing trend is only going to be detrimental in the future. I am thankful that the government actually recognises the need to advance education in these fields, but they have clearly been remiss in doing their homework on how development in education should take place. 
 There is an urgent  need to instill the importance of an interdisciplinary education and highlight the benefit of picking up transferable skills to make student across all forms of engineering more employable. We are to be blamed in the first place to have created an atmosphere where the most gratifying reward is, not academic achievement, but a fat bank balance.",A27_97,Policy/Economy," I agree with your view point. But also let me add something. The dismal employment scenario in our country though majorly due to bad education and economic policy is not the only reason. Working in the education sector i find that even potential job seekers are to be blamed for the rising unemployment. They are not updated with the market requirements and their expectations have no relation to their skills. > new conventional

Also, three language formula has been already going on since 1968 so there is nothing new in the new policy I would say that three language formula is good.....Because You have to learn your mother tongue, English is necessary and any other language that reduces such chaos.....

1) I went to my uncle for some work...my aunt said that she wouldn't enroll her son to north Indian college because North Indians are violent.(All this because of political propaganda)

2)I was talking with a guy who told me that they judge people by their name-plate of bike. If your name-plate of bike has MH-12(pune rto initial) you are good biker, but MH-14(Pimpari Chinchwad) are bad bikers. Every man who broke the traffic rule were all from non-pune registration.

"What is Vietnam, Thailandand other South East countries, Bangladesh etc doing better that makes manufacturing companies set up their factories there instead of india?",49,c9di31,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9di31/what_is_vietnam_thailandand_other_south_east/,26,1562343804.0,"Can anyone in any  manufacturing industry or sector explain what is Vietnam, bangladesh, Thailand etc are doing better in terms of law that many manufacturing companies are setting up their factories there instead of india?

Pakistan lost almost 20% of its textile industry to bangladesh in past few years while  India dosen't seem to have benefitted from it.

Similarly, american trade war with China is forcing many companies to shift part of their industries to Thailand, Vietnam etc while none of them seem to be planning anything in India?

What is the issue? What are we doing wrong?

Each department has a checklist of ridiculous regulations and bureaucratic egos to get through. It gets further complicated if one department needs a NOC (no-objection certificate) from another department.

Now when you start putting in money, it is obviously not all equity, you take on debt and debt starts running the moment you get sanctioned and you end up having to pay bribes to speed things through because otherwise your interest costs go up.

If you somehow manage to do all this and get clearances, you now have to brave through irregular power, an unskilled workforce and bad infrastructure.

Now if you manage to do even this but somehow get into a dispute with a client or a customer or a supplier, the Court system will ensure it takes 10+ years to resolve which may mean the money is stuck, forever.

AND on top of all this, you may get visits from: provident fund department, fire department, water pollution board, the electrical department, the income tax department, the GST department, labour inspector, ESIC (labour insurance) department and numerous other domain-related entities like FSSAI for food or Legal Metrology department for packaging.

Now if you end up earning anything, you get taxed more than other countries.

We only have one thing going for us - the huge amount of people who can buy things. That's it. There is no magic sauce in India. It's a shithole to work in and soon the world will figure India did not really live up to the promise because half of their people are chutiyas. Vietnam already had a pretty decent manufacturing base as Samsung and other South Korean companies had huge factories there. South Korea is the biggest FDI nation for Vietnam. So when China became less favorable it made natural sense for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and Taiwanese companies to move to Vietnam. This was going to happen even without tariffs as labor has become more and more expensive in China. 

India has screwed itself by not making it easier to do business though I understand that it has made improvements in recent years. And it's anti-China attitude doesn't help. Instead of tying to emulate what China did decades ago people act like it's the enemy.

Another huge problem in India is that power is devolved between the center and the states so it creates more bureaucracy. In a one party system like Vietnam that isn't the case and the government has been able to develop industrial parks that have proper infrastructure such as electricity, water, internet, etc.  You also don't have to worry about a change of government like in India where one party promises you something and then it is gone at the next election. Vietnam also benefits from its geography, it has thousands of miles of coastline and some large ports. It is closer by cargo ship to major markets in East Asia, SE Asia, and North America than India. Expat here - Indian bureaucracy is a nightmare Labor laws. Indian labor laws are the only laws in the world in the world which dis-incentivises more employment. Just see that under our labor laws,companies can‚Äôt fire workers if there are more than 100 workers in a factory. This makes the factories to keep the employment at the range of less than 100 so that they don‚Äôt have to comply with labor laws and hence factories don‚Äôt grow and nor does employment. And big manufacturing units don‚Äôt need these problems. The biggest difference between India and Bangladesh('s economy) is/are  their respective labour law(s) 


The excerpt I've given below is taken from this article (link) but I've read simlar things in almost every article about this topic 


https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/why-is-bangladesh-booming/amp/#page-content

""All labor markets need regulation. But, in India, the 1947 Industrial Disputes Act imposes heavy restrictions on firms‚Äô ability to contract workers and expand their labor force, ultimately doing more harm than good.

 The law was enacted a few months before the August 1947 independence of India and Pakistan from British imperial rule, meaning that both new countries inherited it.

 But Pakistan‚Äôs military regime, impatient with trade unions from the region that would become Bangladesh, repealed it in 1958.

Thus, having been born without the law, Bangladesh offered a better environment for manufacturing firms to achieve economies of scale and create a large number of jobs."" Pretty much what the others said. Only rising domestic demand will compel companies to set up factories in India. Check ease of doing business report.

Country ratings from page 73 onwards. There is too much regulation and it is scattered across several different pieces of legislation. Getting approvals and permits is also a massive nightmare.

Unions are extremely political.

People resort to violence for things they disagree with.

Government flip-flops on policies faster than actual flip-flops switch between 0 and 1.

Bureaucrats feel entitled to bribes to approve things.

High tech manufacturing also requires clean air and water. India is an awful place for these. Our labour laws are one of the worst in the entire world. But even keeping that aside, our labour is costly. They may take low wages but their productivity is too low compared to all those countries you mentioned. This is because of decades of under investment in health and education. When your workers are frequently falling sick or not even able to read a manual for a machine and follow instructions. Why would you set up business here? Also infrastructure is quite bad. The behaviour of the bureaucracy is horrible. They behave as if *they* are a doing a favour to the businesses where they should be begging them for investment. Basically our entire state apparatus top to bottom isn't trained or interested in investment and jobs. No surprise there, they are the legacies of British colonialism. It would be a surprise if they worked to our benefit. I agree with much of the comments here regarding Indian bureaucracy. Living outside India myself, I see many non-Indians dread dealing with any government agency in India. In spite of all the improvements, even getting a visa and travelling to India in more difficult than to many SE Asian countries. 
India has to make it easy (I dare say pleasant) for outsiders to deal with the agencies and travel to. If outsiders have a negative impression from initial interactions, they are unlikely to think of manufacturing in India.

Modi govt plans to bring 75% of all Indians under Ayushman Bharat,141,bw6anb,https://theprint.in/india/governance/modi-govt-plans-to-bring-75-of-all-indians-under-ayushman-bharat/244718/,139,1559562778.0,,JamburaStudio,Policy/Economy," Here's the unpopular opinion on this sub...say what you want about modi politics but the guy is doing right thing when it comes to handling policy..

The probelm with government policy is that there are thousands of them which makes a mess so bad that even upsc topper can't fully understand it..

The top priority should not be to create new schemes but making existing one's more efficient and effective and simple.

Combining all healthcare schemes into one is definitely a good move and it can be the first step towards universal health care in next decade or something. The biggest out of pocket expenditure for the poor is the outpatient services which is not covered by this or any other insurance scheme. What I fear is that they will further reduce funding into public health infrastructure which is already overburdened while putting money into this insurance scheme which is just going into the hands of the corporates. 

A great primary health infrastructure is the most important step in health care than providing access to tertiary level care. Yeah, remember all the big bang smart city reforms that were going to change India's 2nd tier cities in 5 years? Lets not count our chickens before they hatch. > The Modi government also plans to merge all existing state and central government-run health insurance schemes under the Ayushman Bharat umbrella.

> ‚ÄúThe central government-run schemes such as Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Employees‚Äô State Insurance (ESI), Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) and the railways health scheme are likely to be merged under the Ayushman Bharat by the end of this year,‚Äù a senior official from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare told ThePrint.

> ‚ÄúThe merger of the existing schemes into Ayushman Bharat would result in covering more than 75 per cent of India‚Äôs population under health insurance.‚Äù

> In fact, the central government has already received proposals from several states to integrate their schemes. ‚ÄúMost of the states are ready for the integration, while talks are on with the remaining few. For instance, Tamil Nadu has merged central and state schemes. Maharashtra‚Äôs Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana is likely to be merged soon with the scheme,‚Äù said another official from the health ministry, without elaborating on the details.

> Integration could help states and the Centre to run the scheme better. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of confusion between the rates under the different schemes. Moreover, it becomes very complex for hospitals to accept and execute multiple schemes,‚Äù the second official added. I saw a very interesting thing one guy said in the CPR discussion on how India voted.

""Our understanding of Hindutva is probably narrow minded. The hindutva is of Savarkar, Golwalkar AND Deen Dayalu Upadhyay where Hindutva is also a Welfare state"" 

Thoughts?

EDIT: People are misunderstanding my comment. This not an endorsement of Hindutva. One guy merely pointed out that welfare state is also a component of Hindutva and perhaps everyone missed that component (Gas, Toilet, and now this) in [this](https://youtu.be/jRkI6CDQvwc?t=217) discussion. Hmmm...is this mandatory Aadhar by the back door ? Ayushman scheme is simply corruption with multiple steps :

It only covers people who are admitted in the hospital.

any bill outside of the hospital is not counted for.

It has open a market for fraud private hospitals, a.) they either charge a lot of money for simple medical conditions in the form of Tests and other things. b.) or they file for (modicare) insurance claim without even having a patient on first place.

With government being hell bent on destroying any kind of transparency in the country, our country is not suitable for any such schemes where the money is going through some private middleman (specially big businessman).

I would prefer schemes where the poor directly benefits : LPG, Medicins, Scholarship (the No.1 thing india needs), clothes/uniform etc.

from my experience... it is really hard to avail these government schemes unless you know your rights and you know how to fight for them. most people do not have the means to do so as they have to earn a living. of course, i could have seen the exceptional cases and things are working out well for the masses. that only can explain the huge mandate modi ji got last month üôè Funded by the remaining 25% First make it efficient for the existing lot, then expand.

India is leading a global charge to make corporate giants pay fair tax,308,by3g3z,https://qz.com/india/1637109/india-is-leading-a-global-charge-to-make-corporate-giants-pay-fair-tax/,66,1559992762.0,,garbagevaluearray,Policy/Economy," This is called base erosion and profit shifting. Basically these MNCs provide services in various countries without having any physical presence there. Think Google. Indians use Google searches and Google makes tonnes of money off of us. However, it's not liable to tax in India. Our tax laws are woefully inadequate for the digital age. This is what countries are trying to fix right now So do they not have to pay taxes on income earned in the sales they book in India? India tried to tax Vodafone when Pranav da was FM. But  unfortunately the govt lost the case in the supreme court.logically the govt was right.after that retrospective amendment was made in parliament to tax Vodafone was met with stiff opposition by the foreign companies and the other political parties.

Now if India wants to make corporate giants pay fair tax then either the corporate giants will charge for their services which are hiherto free or they'll reduce their investment and infrastructure support and concentrate on countries with a friendlier environment.

OECD has been pushing to reduce BEPS for the longest time but it has to be implemented by all countries simultaneously otherwise if India does it in isolation we'll face problems of higher charges and lesser investment as mentioned earlier Would ambani will be in that list? As if there is any use in paying taxes in this country. I pay 30% income tax, property tax, road tax and gst on everything. And what do I get in return?

Water shortage since summer started, dangerous  pothole filled roads, dust and garbage everywhere,  electricity  cut for 4 or more hours. Living in bangalore has become a nightmare. Hope it works out the global streamlined way. Unilaterally, India passing laws could potentially be regressive for India as the article points out.

Maybe this smoke and mirror, to make India more relevant globally. Which is also acceptable. India!!!! ??? Hainnnn... acha acha acha acha >India

K. I think this is not the right time to tax them. We still need the infrastructure done rapidly. Once, the customer base is there and it becomes part of daily needs, we can think of taxing the corporations. 

Example : If we don't have 5G or e-vehicles. These companies should not pay excess taxes. We should encourage worldwide players to set up a base here and provide the service/infra. Once, it reaches maturity and becomes an indispensable part of our lives, we should get on the corporate giant's ass to get paid for our customer base. Else, no one will invest or will invest at a glacial pace. India should make it easier for foreign investors to invest their money in Indian markets instead of pushing them away. Foreign investors not only include big corporations but small and medium scale business should also be able to invest and contribute to Indian customers and Indian development. By taxing more and tons of regulations India is pushing small and medium businesses away and big corporations that can survive the wave can easily divert burden of cost to customers who are mostly the middle class and lower class.", Crocbro_8DN th3_pund1t Spideyocd rig_vedic_sage abhi8207 ragical wireditfellow amoghers thelielmao Ra_19

Desh aagey badh Raha hai. Isn't this 'crony capitalism' as per the definition that gets thrown around these days? Wait, PMDs will be zooming around in Delhi? I totally agree that this is a positive move and totally believe that our cities should get rid of the poisonous fumes but I have a problem. My problem is related to this hyper-capitalism culture that we have developed where the core issue is not discussed and solved and instead, superficial issues are solved. My main concern is fossil fuel burnt to generate the energy through which these EVs will be charged. Yes, adopting positive technology is a great step to eradicate fossil fuels but the fossil fuel will be still used by the powerplants to generate the amount of energy to run the EVs and our environment will still be getting polluted, not on the same level but it will be getting polluted.  


Secondly, Shouldn't the government be more interested in adopting renewable energy instead of adopting a new variation of the same system? Going by the recent trend, we are not actually promoting renewable energy with because of the very low tariffs demands in the wind energy sector by MNRE and there are so also many similar problems that governments have tried to not a find a solution to.

Basically, we should think more about the carbon footprint left by these EVs than getting hyped by the new policies bought by the government to crook the people of the country.

"Excuse me, what the fuck!",218,bvujou,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bvujou/excuse_me_what_the_fuck/,125,1559485190.0,"There have been reports (which I'll be linking at the end of this post) of AAP considering traveling for women by buses and metro to be completely free of cost. With a few months to go for assembly elections, this move by AAP seems more of desperate measure to rope in all the women voters.

Considering 25% percent of the riders to be women, the finances absolutely do not work out. There are already glaring issues regarding the safety of women and providing freebies is definitely not the way to go about it.

I have attached the annual report of DMRC which clearly shows that it is eventually finding its way to profitability. Making metro commute free for women will be a hugely regressive step in the existing scheme of things.

This proposal will not only fuck the DMRC finances but also the increase in footfall will be catastrophic for the management and also for the fellow commuters who are *paying* for the metro rides. I am an average randian and it took me a few minutes to predict the possibility of this glaring repercussion. Imagine the issues that will be discovered if this step is analyzed thoroughly.

Edit: This post did not age well :)",theindianbuoy,Policy/Economy," Things politicians do for winning elections. I wanna smoke what these guys are smoking They should rather decrease the current fare and increase their last mile connectivity to metro stations, as this will be more profitable and increase the number of passengers DMRC is jointly owned by Delhi and the Central government, so I believe AK can't take this decision unilaterally. Also, I think that they will probably launch some sort of cards for women and then Delhi Government will reimburse DMRC for total usage of those cards, there is no way DMRC is going to bear the cost.

Delhi Metro fares may have risen in the past few years but it still remains a relatively cheap and comfortable mode of transport, I don't know any other transport service that is safe, air conditioned, beats traffic and pollution, readily available and can take me to 5 different cities for 60 rupees max. So it's in best interest of citizens (both men and women) that this service is not fucked up to win elections.

Edit: [This one year old article](https://www.businesstoday.in/buzztop/delhi-metro-sees-increase-in-daily-footfall-in-february-from-the-lows-of-oct-2017/story/272767.html) states that around 27 lakh people use metro on daily basis, let's say about 30 lakh use in June 2019 and out of which 20% are women. So that's 6 lakh women travelling in metro on daily basis, and let's assume that the percentage of women travelers increase to 10 lakh after fare waiver. Assuming that on an average a woman was spending 80 rupees per day on metro travel, that would amount to 2920 crore rupees annually, that's about 5% of their [annual budget](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/delhi-budget-2019-aap-government-presents-rs-60000-cr-budget-with-focus-on-education-and-health/article26373700.ece). I am a woman and I think this is totally a nonsensical step. I can afford to pay and I should pay. May be give special cards or discounted rates for the poor. (Delhi metro rates are getting expensive for daily commute if you aren't in a white collar job). A subsidized service for the poor is understandable. (Also it takes off some pressure off the roads and pollution, so it can be rationalised). But blanket freebies for all women just doesn't make any sense. Oh BKL tax dena band kar dunga main bata rha hu. So much for gender equality. -_- Wait why will DMRC listen to them on this if they didn't listen to them on the fare hike issue? I don't want free travel. I want safe travel. Just saying. I pay extra these days and go by cab rather than bus or local trains. Make it safer for me to go by trains. Hook up CCTV in every Compartment and platform. 

Have women officers in every station or at least a police cell. So many local stations don't have any officers in the booth! When we come and complain to you (meaning officers) that we got groped, be understanding, don't say ""this is what happens if you go out dressed like that at 8 pm."" 

When we walk on the platforms, don't stare at us and make us uncomfortable. When we really need you, we won't approach because we're scared you'll be worse than the perverts on the train. DONT LET MEN BOARD LADIES ONLY COMPARTMENT! 

I've seen this happen way too much. These men board from one side, grab some womans butt, get off on the other side and run! There should be fines imposed and threat of arrest to men who get into ladies compartments. On a slow day, in an almost empty ladies car, I saw a man get on, sit diagonally opposite to me and stare at me the entire time touching his crotch area from outside his pants. I got off the train at the immediate next stop, but if this happens in broad daylight, I can't imagine the women who travel alone at night. 

I'm willing to pay a lot more than just 5 rs. For the local trains, if you'll make it safer. Nobody cares if you travel for free, if you don't even reach your destination in one piece.


Edit: the hive mind here is out of control!! You guys don't agree with me, that's fine. Don't PM me threats and disgusting shit okay? I'm not going to delete my account because some of you butthurt little boys want me to. And I'm definitely not deleting this comment. I hope you guys see this edit and send some more threats to me. I'd love to post it on r/creepypms. Time to buy a burka when travelling in Delhi. Relax, Delhi Government does not have the authority to regulate Metro fares since it's a joint project between Delhi and Central government. I really really doubt the Central government will allow a move like this (and justifiably so) because:

1. Our fiscal deficit while not wildly out of control, does not allow us to dish out freebies.
2. The target audience (only women living in Delhi NCR) is simply not big enough to convince the center to give out a dole like this.
3. One way for this step to happen would be if Delhi Govt were to reimburse the government for the loss of revenue. If you look at last year's [annual report](http://www.delhimetrorail.com/OtherDocuments/DMRC-English-AR-Year-2017-18.pdf). Delhi Metro made about Rs. 2,600 cr from ticket sales. If we assume that roughly 1/3rd of the riders are ladies (and I'm sure it'll be more than this, 1 coach on every train is exclusively reserved for them and they have good numbers in the non reserved coaches as well!) then it means AK's govt will need to provide Rs. 800 cr every year (and growing) to fund this initiative. While the Delhi budget might have that money to spare - a good question would also be if this is the best possible utilization of such a serious amount of money?
4. While the jury will be out on this one, I strongly think that this would be the death knell of Delhi metro. Again, referring to the annual report, last year Delhi Metro made a loss of Rs. 144 cr (not surprising, its not a for profit organization and given the level of service it provides, the fares are still pretty cheap). Now imagine the organization losing a good chunk of revenue while liabilities like salaries, cost of power, security, debt servicing etc remain as is or keep growing. Do we really need another white elephant which survives only on taxpayers money?

&#x200B;

It's early days for NDA-2 (or will it be NDA-3? ;) but one of the things we have heard about is that the government wants to divest away from PSUs and either reform or shut down unprofitable PSUs. In such a scenario why would the government willingly push a public enterprise towards financial mismanagement?

While I may not agree with some of the welfare schemes like farm loan waivers, I can still buy them since they impact a huge chunk of the population and by providing money directly in the hands of farmers allow consumption to pick up. I'm not sure what sort of economic boost will we get out of a move like this. Before people bring up security, as a regular user of Delhi Metro I would like to point out that the service is fairly secure even today. There are armed CISF checkpoints and men rarely if ever enter the reserved ladies compartment. In general I've seen that while people grumble, they easily give up reserved seats for ladies when asked to do so.

While this step is still under consideration, it comes across as a purely political move rather than one having any social or economic value.

Even science. I'll tell you why. Because out languages refused to evolve when there was a possibility of that happening. Language needs to keep up with new inventions to be relevant. A language needs to accept words, ideas etc from others to stay current. We're a couple of centuries behind, and making worthiest shit up rather than accepting common words.

Source: did my schooling in marathi. Science was a nightmare full of a alien made up words that no one understood: karba dvi pranil is carbon dioxide, amla is acid, and so on (I've either repressed or forgotten other made up shit, but it was way worse). Impossible to access scientifuc literature and understand what they are talking about even if i learned english in school, because I didn't know what english words the made up bullshit corresponded to.

If I have to learn made up words in a dead language (sanskrit) that no one else in the outside world understands, and I find hard to understand, since I'm not a native speaker of the dead language, why should I bother learning those words rather than words that everyone else understands? 

We should teach everyone our native languages in school, we should give people an option of finishing schooling in native languages (at the cost of struggling during higher education or jobs), but we shouldn't kid ourselves by claiming that reinventing the wheel is a good use of our time and resources. 

Learning english, and keeping stem education in english has a massive advantage of facilitating mobility within the country as well as outside.


Having said that, fuck ""english medium"" schools where teachers either can't speak english or choose not to, ""because students don't understand"". Fuckers, do your job, and teach them english. What's with the attitude against people learning English?? Explain this to me, downvote whatever. I want reasoning for why the article in the print has that bit about English, it reeks of jealousy in my opinion. Mostly makes sense except for the hate for English and right wing trigger words / bogeyman of elites . Could someone ELI5 the difference between the two? So, Indian parents have four years to stress their children out as opposed to current only two years. With such a massive overhaul, i wish they had proposed some sort of sex education in the draft.

The influence of RSS on the MHRD might be troublesome in the future. This policy looks pretty great on paper. If they actually manage to translate this into reality, our education system might finally be able to not drive students into despair. A very simple question to all commentators here because reddit is clearly not a representative of India and I'm curious what type of people are commenting here when in India only 15% speak English. 

(1) What type of school did you go to? Govt/Convent/Private?

(2) What was your socio-economic class? 

(3) What was the medium of instruction? The last 4 years will be like semi -colleges . More freedom from schoollife but less freedom than college one. Similar to what we see in anime. > In addition to Sanskrit, the teaching of other classical languages and literature of India, including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Pali, Persian, and Prakrit has also been recommended for ensuring that these languages and literature stay alive and vibrant, especially in states where they may be best taught and nurtured.

That's about 7.2 crores - (USD/INR)/10 in assets

The HNW population is about 280,000

India's population is 1.3 billion (133.92 crores). So this is **about 0.02% of India's population**

A lot of these people just have a large-ish house by Indian city standards and a mid segment car. They're typically the sort of people that buy the latest apple products and have an ultra HD netflix subscription and Bose speakers (or at least this is the demographic that these companies see as their consumers), and probably don't travel in business class. They're India's landed gentry class of a sort, albeit slightly on the richer side. You will probably spot them in [D segment cars](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/sedans/181385-d-segment-sedan-battle-elantra-vs-corolla-altis-vs-octavia-vs-jetta-vs-cruze-12.html), and maybe some of them would own entry level luxury cars (think cars under 50L). Higher end cars are taxed heavily in India, so this lowers the buying capacity. [Up to 43% GST tax for hybrid cars like the Camry](https://www.livemint.com/Industry/Smmgim8pKAARdtXRcB8HfP/GST-derails-hybrid-car-sales-in-India.html) which is in no way a super luxury car.

That's 2,15,97,00,000 INR (216 crores). Which is **0.000330742% of the population. That's 1.6% of the HNW category. Which is 1.6% of the 0.02% of India's population.**

This is when you get into the supercar, business/first class air travel category of people. The Ambanis, Adanis, Vijay Mallyas and other business tycoons. They're the people who regularly buy luxury brands, live in modern villas; their own gated complexes and have a legion of servants. If you see a Porsche on the road, you probably spotted one of them in India. And yes, you can see them in most metros. They splurge on Swiss holidays with designer fashion or eating in Michelin starred restaurants. India's government has eased on foreign holiday spending partly to keep this category of people happy.

To put things in context India's consumer class from the perspective of medium-high end multinational brands is barely 1% of the population:

Remember - H&M isn't really a luxury brand by international standards.

>more than 99% of the Indian population are in the same league as Americans that count as below the poverty line 

People will say, 'but this ignores purchasing power' - it does; but for international brands there is a base cost, and they aren't going to do business in India at a loss. There is a cost for importing goods to India which frequently offsets the much lower labor costs. India still has a very protectionist economy, and it has historically discouraged the emergence or proliferation of a consumer class (it's an 'evil west' thing, lol).

Whenever some nationalist nitwit starts bragging about India's ""great"" middle class one should point them to this inconvenient truths.

Another interesting exercise is to see where the HNWs and ultra-HNWs are in India:

>The report also identifies Kochi as one the leading emerging cities in terms of private wealth creation.  Chandigarh, Surat, Ahmedabad, Visakhapatnam, Goa, Jaipur and Vadodara are the other cities in the list of emerging wealth hubs in India.

There's no easy answer to this kind of shocking inequality, but maybe someday there will be a need to have special tax slabs for these demographics. Many western countries do. Inheritance taxes and estate taxes are very controversial and seen as disincentivizing wealth creation, which is partially true. The stock market used to be tax free in India and the govt recently made a change to make a lot of share market trading taxable - this is definitely intended to target the super-rich, and probably a good move. India's govt is still deeply socialist (things didn't really change at all between the UPA and NDA along these lines):

This means that this bullet train will require approximately 0.00274% of mangroves or in other words, if India were to use 1% of it mangroves, India could construct 370 such bullet trains in coastal regions.


http://frienvis.nic.in/Database/Mangrove-Cover-in-India_2444.aspx

Added to this, the Environmental impact assessment report suggests that 

> Five times  the number of  mangroves destroyed/cut during  the construction process shall be replanted.

Environmental Impact assessment for bullet train maybe downloaded from here-

So much more wildland is cut down every single day for road expansion and infrastructure.

There are plenty of actual points against this bullet train lunacy you don't this kind of weak arguments as possible disadvantages. We should have a ecological benefit analysis, if these high speed trains get passengers from airplanes that will be a tremendous benefit as airplanes are one of the most polluting and least energy efficient way to transport people. 

Blind mangrove counting is stupid. You can grow plants on pretty much every piece of land in a fertile country like India that means any land use is wrong and first we should chop down recreational uses of land like restaurants etc and club them all together to create mini forest in trees to save the environment. They won't be able to grow that much green even if they planted mangroves on 26hectors. Full grown tree takes years to grow, I have read comments that they should plan \*5 trees but that would just end up on paper, Growth of those trees will take ages and that too if they are actually planted and taken care of. I just wish they use some form of techniques or machines like Tree relocation machines to save as much as they can. Growth and development should not come at the cost of the nature. No doubt the population in India is growing and already a lot of the greens have been destroyed but at least if a person can't actually be a value individually such public infrastructure projects need to be careful with the path they choose for the development.

Traffic police turns up and fines the unlucky car driver. >*The law states violations including not giving way to emergency services such as ambulance will attract a fine of Rs 10,000 while aggregators violating terms will have to pay a fine of Rs 5,000.*

This is a welcome move. Must be followed everywhere and it could save many lives.

> *The Bill also includes several other amendments like fine for drinking and driving has been increased from Rs 2,000 to Rs 10,000, speeding fine has been increased from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000. Similarly, fine for not wearing a seat belt has been increased from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000.* 

The increase in fine for drinking and driving should have some practical changes and improvements. Overall, it is uplifting if it put into force as soon as possible with more care. Wo sab to theek hai but road pe traffic police bhi to chaie na... If no one gives way to ambulance then are they going to hunt each one down and fine them? I appreciate this fact, but in most of the country including the so-called ""big cities"", you have potholed roads the width of a f\*king needle on which about 20,000 vehicles are trying to travel all at once. If an ambulance comes on this road, where will the vehicles go? Jump in the air? First make the roads navigable, have emergency lanes or at least make well defined lanes so that lane switching is possible.

Also, about the other things like drinking and driving, seat belt etc., there is no way to enforce this. Most of the violators are cabs and autos, and if you try to get this money from them there will be large scale protests after which the law will need to be amended. Who's going to implement? Joke. I feel like each new law should be announced with some sort of an implementation strategy. The 10,000 fine is welcome but I'm unsure as to how it will be practically implemented.

Water scarcity -> Population

Pollution -> Population

Low QoL -> Population

Traffic -> Population

I know the population growth has come down by a lot in the last 2 decades, but we still need to think about family planning even in remote parts of India, not just Bangalore and Mumbai. I think some of this fear mongering about apocalypses and such is to distract ordinary people away from the real causes for this, which is simply political and personal apathy to tackle rainwater harvesting on a national scale. 

Once the monsoons come, everyone forgets about this and votes for their politicians according to other preferences. 90% of the people who post on FB about saving water will not look into greywater recycling or rainwater harvesting for their building.

Until we start voting for people who actually have robust infrastructure building plans, this is never going to get fixed. If we can't look past the heavy rainfall and remember the water shortages of only 3 months ago, we aren't going to make any progress in solving this until there's a freak monsoon which fails 100%, which would be terrifying. >The sugar mills have a vice-like grip on procurement prices, and connected to them is a host of shady co-operative banks. They combine to ensure policies that are inimical to a water-sustainable future.           




For fucking sugar. Let the politicians keep collecting money. One day a mob pissed off due to water shortage will teach them money is worth nothing if there is nothing to spend it on I can personally attest to water scarcity issue in India, around a week ago I (and everyone in my locality) started getting water at very low pressure. Turns out the the ground water level has fallen so low that there simply isn't enough water present underground. (The locality gets its water from bore well). And this is at a place where there was never any water shortage issue. So, after the droughts in central India even the rest of the country is slowly heading towards the point of severe water shortage. I remember reading an article that said that Punjab's underground water will run out after 20 or so years. (Agriculture there is heavily dependent upon tube wells). A country cannot sustain an economy without food.

We need to realize that water scarcity isn't something we will face in future, we are facing it right now. Why is Nehru not making dams

Why are Karnataka‚Äôs schoolchildren unhappy with the mid-day meal? Iskcon‚Äôs Akshaya Patra Foundation refuses to add onion or garlic to the meals it provides even though the children crave the familiar taste,176,bvizyl,https://www.thehindu.com/society/why-are-karnatakas-schoolchildren-unhappy-with-the-mid-day-meal/article27378176.ece,127,1559409835.0,,madamplease,Policy/Economy," Its a catch 22 situation. 

While other vendors are giving below par quality (sometimes harmful) meals to children - these people are giving good quality (because of their beliefs) but not including onions and garlic. 

Can we not have some ethical agencies which does both?

> When asked if the government was being partial to APF, Umashankar denied it. ‚ÄúWho is going to serve such a huge number of children if we cancel this contract?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are logistical issues; overnight, we cannot build kitchens and hire cooks. The administration cannot function on the basis of philosophical arguments. I‚Äôve told these activists directly ‚Äî they have their heads in the clouds. I live on earth.‚Äù

If you ignore his tone here - he has a valid point. The only reason APF keeps getting contract is because they are performing well and meeting the scale. > In February 2019, NIN gave its formal nod to APF‚Äôs menu and said: ‚ÄúThe nutritive values of menus with ingredients used in the mentioned amounts certainly meet and often exceed the prescribed energy (Kcal) and protein requirements prescribed by MHRD (Ministry of Human Resource Development) for the MDM.‚Äù

Seems like right nutritional value is met... If kids prefer meat, they could skip this meal as they do, according to the article My wedding was in a ISKCON TEMPLE.yes. ironic that I'm an athiest. But I take don't know why they don't like onion and garlic

Also their food was really good. Didn't realise that it was without onion & garlic It is what it is... APF is giving high quality food at reasonable cost with some restrictions. Onion and garlic are great but flavor can be achieved without them and iskcon Cooks do that. Seems like much Ado about nothing

I'm willing to bet that if there was another org that was serving food with meat and eggs and all that, there would have been voices saying that there's no options for vegetarians

It is difficult to reach a large scale when you try to accommodate everyone's preferences Atleast it is better quality than what they would be getting out of government run kitchens.

Is the government even prepared to provide food to so many childrens while maintaining the same standards.The answer is NO. Time for a Tadka service. An NGO that just provides onion and garlic tadka to this food and we are set. Let Iskon give their food (as they are cheap & efficient) - because that is all the state can afford.

People who are complaining can just deliver supplements to the form of beef, onion, pork etc. I have couple of questions 


Does the food have all the nutritional value recommended? 

Does the food taste good??

Is it hygienic and of good quality?

Is this the cheapest bid?

If answers to all of the above questions are yes , then I dont see any problem My question is off topic, but what happened to the people who served poisonous mid-day meal in bihar some time back? Jees what a bunch of ungrateful kids. They get really good food, fresh and nutritious food. But do these kids want to spoil  themselves. Today its onion tomorrow they may say add maggie and burgers. What's the problem with onion and garlic? Anybody can explain? It's not like they are feeding meat to vegetarians. Onion and garlic have lots of  benefits. Why would one single out two vegetables out of children's diet citing stupid reasons. Which idiot approved of this. About time children's diet at government schools should be written by dieticians and nutrition experts and not some idiot in a company who doesn't know shit about nutrition.", ravindra_jadeja gigibuffoon VikasNotFound gigibuffoon amntrashu budbuk MrJekyll chaprasibabu freestyle50m xpsdeset rockersmp3

No offence but I dont think it makes any impact. When I see [change.org](https://change.org), I SMH. God knows how many petitions are up there with over exceeding votes but with 0 actions taken Lol....change.org.....so naive. Wishful thinking. 

Our government refuses to accept climate change. They just denied a report saying India‚Äôs cities were one of the hottest in the world.

Change.org survives in India only to satisfy the guilt of people who want to do something but won‚Äôt. Modi: Climate change nahi huwa he, hum change ho gaye he. I wish climate change would have been mentioned in religious texts. Only then people would get it. Given the size of population, you might wanna  increase the target of petitions to 75 million for some significant person to notice.

On other note, people who are whining about the petition, sign the damn thing. People sign petition over fucking TV shows all the time. Okay, say govt declares it then what? Have the intelligent people behind this petition what to do next? No govt will want to intentionally trash their country's environment. 

Modern life in some capacity will damage environment, they aren't any 2 ways about that. What we can do is 

1. Reduce the impact we have

2. Take steps to actively fix things

We have signed the Paris deal, we are going all on solar and nuclear power since 2014. But the fact is, we will need to build coal plants also. We are an energy poor nation to begin with add to the mix our ever increasing population unless the average Indian is ready to accept the current/lower level of lifestyle we need to keep moving forward. 

Now, to do further stuff under purview of point 1 we need to do things like electric cars, better quality of power plants, more expensive vechicle ( BS 6 norms ). This all requires money, which requires development.

Further looking you need money for point 2, China again is an excellent example for us to look at. They are planting trees like crazy, they are literally in the process of the best afforestation of desert to have ever happened. They have the economics to do that.

We also need to address the white elephant in the room, our population. Even average people can see plainly it's unsustainable. We have been doing education/healthcare for a long time now yet out TFR is way way high than it should be. Again, I highly doubt govt will have any problems in bringing population control laws, it's up to people if we would accept it.

And contrary to what lots of people here think, BJP doesn't deny climate change. What they rightfully deny is ANY interference by hypocrite govts of western world who should be hanging their heads in shame for bringing most of the current state of the earth and then have the audacity to blame us. You all supporting them should also introspect what matters more, superficial validation by theives and deceits or your countrymen. Many problems in India are man mad.

The Madras HC allows our intervention in the Aadhaar and Social Medial linking petition.,144,c63u62,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c63u62/the_madras_hc_allows_our_intervention_in_the/,16,1561659774.0,"

### Highlights

* **Background:** Two writ petitions were filed in the Madras High Court in July 2018 praying for the interlinking of Aadhaar with social media for identity authentication purposes. We were deeply concerned with this development and decided to intervene.
* **Intervention time:** Given the relevance of these cases, IFF goes to Court for the 6th time, continuing its fight for the right to privacy of the citizens of ¬†India, amongst various other concerns. Our stand in court is to protect user privacy, prevent surveillance but also to address the harms and regulatory issues such as end-to-end encryption which are of concern to the Hon'ble Court. Rest assured, all our submissions are to advance digital rights and the constitutional values!

### / Why we decided to intervene.

Information is necessary for a well functioning society. However, it also carries power and creates social structures. For instance social media while making sure all of us remain connected is no longer merely a way to stay in touch. It has become a way of life and permits a wider functionality. This also carries risks and harms. Many social media platforms today are rife with abuse, misinformation and illegal content. It is undermining the demos of Indian democracy. A solution which has been posed in the Madras High Court is linking the real world identities (government ID's such as Aadhaar) with social media accounts.

Concerned by these developments, in early June, 2019, we filed two interventions in *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India & Ors* (W.P. No. 20774/2018) and *Janani Krishnamurthy v. Union of India* (W.P. No. 20214/2018). This is in our continuing work in approaching and assisting courts all over India in matters related to technology and fundamental rights. In the hearing today, our intervention application was accepted by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras. We thank our counsels Arun Karthik Mohan and Suhrith Parthasarathy for their representation.

### // Why linking Aadhaar to social media is terrible.

Aadhaar being linked with our social media accounts? Here's why we think this would result in a terrible outcome.

* **Increased power of social media companies over users:** It would undermine the right to privacy in several ways. At present we can only visualise a few, and as we very well know with technology based policy interventions, the outcomes are often much worse and the threats only multiple when user rights are not considered at the outset. For instance, it would allow social media companies to gather deeper, more granular information about their users. A government ID, especially one such as Aadhaar which has a common identifier would permit them to link the personal data on the social media platform more easily. This would result in more pervasive dossiers of social media users available to the highest bidder who can serve us then with ads across platforms. Not to mention it would also increase the harms to speech by chilling dissenting voices.
* **Troubling legality:** This also becomes troubling neatly on the legality of the proposal. As per us, the private use of Aadhaar remains problematic as indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. This becomes incredibly dangerous when it is mandatorily linked to our social media accounts. All this is happening while we are still governed by deficient safeguards, that were devised for telephone tapping applied to digital surveillance by the government. In a related matter to reform the safeguards for government surveillance (which is at present occurring without any judicial oversight) we have made a constitutional challenge through a petition in the Supreme Court of India by filing *Internet Freedom Foundation v. Union of India* (W.P. (C). No. 44/2019) \[Soon coming up for hearing on July 2, 2019\].
* **Increased risk to minors and women:** Linking real world identities may counter intuitively also contribute to the spreading of misinformation, abuse and threats which not only result in a direct attack against our democracy but also allows for individualised harms which more often come through to women and children. Women (other persons as well, especially individuals from vulnerable groups) in India quite often have adopted pseudonyms on social media to avoid censure from family, acquaintances or wider social judgement. Linking their Aadhaar to their social media accounts would tremendously increase informational risks even rising to the level of threats to their physical security.

### /// A short statement on today's developments

IFF's executive director, Apar Gupta stated that, ""*We are grateful to the Hon'ble Madras High Court for permitting us to make submissions given the vexed issues of Aadhaar and social media linking. This was possible due to the submissions of our counsel Suhrith Parthasarthy who is advising and representing us in this case. He also indicated the larger issues before the court on which we plan to engage in future hearings. Given the pervasive use of social media in our lives and the existing tools to harvest and utilise data for marketing purposes, not to mention, individualised advertisements, the entire gathering of personal data itself has been a constant cause for concern in the law few years. Adding Aadhaar to this cocktail for the purpose of verification of identity would arguably create further harm. This case also concerns issues of online abuse, misinformation which can contribute to challenges to social order and when law enforcement is deficient, even violence. Hence, the Hon'ble Court has also in recent hearings been considering issues of intermediary liability and end-to-end encryption. On all these issues, IFF's staff will work with care to ensure submissions are made to safeguard and protect the digital rights of every social media user in India.*""

In continuance with IFF's mission -- we will keep approaching courts in a systematic and planned manner to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights of every India.

Transparency is a hallmark in all of IFF's work. Hence, as with all our filed case pleadings even a copy of the intervention application is made public and is available in the link below. The next date for hearing in this case is July 26, 2019.

Adani train, Birla train [deleted] Narrator : This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Considering that by not running it themselves they'll hand over a contract etc. 

Will the trains be that of the Indian Railways? 

What's the private in the process? Who would control the ticket prices? In my opinion, private players won't operate at the same ticket levels. Either the ticket prices would go up or the service level would come down further. Aren't Railways already privatized? Catering contracts, Sanitation contracts, luggage handling contracts - about 50% of work in Railways is already vendor and contractor management. 

Most people commenting don't seem to have read that IRCTC is the ""private"" operator. 

The trains are still going to belong to Indian Railways, the drivers and mechanics too, but ticketing and servicing end-to-end will be done by IRCTC. We're heading in the direction of shitty private British rail with their bad service and horrible trains. 

If they want to Privatise, they can do it the Italian way with Italo competing with Trenitalia. Ahh finally. Indian Railways is the epitome of inefficiency and needs to be binned for a much more efficient and better quality of services. 

I think there was also a plan to break the railways into eight divisions but the ego of the politicians did not let that happen. Hopefully Piyush Goyal allows this to happen and see what can happen if an organisation is run by professionals and not some babus. I don't understand why are people against this move. IR has been making losses for decades. Isn't it a waste of taxpayer money? Privatization will bring competition in the industry which will provide good services at the lowest possible prices, just like Telecom and Airline industries. Private players know how to run a business. They wouldn't have to worry about paying high salaries and pensions and keeping unwanted employees. They won't carry ticketless passengers, thus saving money on fuel and maximizing per train revenue. They will run trains on schedule, without delays, thereby increasing turnover per train. In short, their operation cost will be far lower than that of IR, resulting in operating profits potentially at even low ticket prices.

Simply compare it to the Airline industry, specifically Indigo vs Air India. Indigo keeps its ticket prices at very competitive levels, most times it's lower than Air India. Even then it generates more operating profits than Air India.", genesispar None wamov oi_piglet dontdousemyfire None indiaisthebestalways vikas_g computerbaba7

A few more terms under these myopic politicians, aided by the largely ignorant population, and we will become a failed Hindu state. 

If that does not happen, and the economy somehow improves, we will see a greater wealth inequality. Though we might have better GDP, per capita income etc on paper, in actuality, all that money will be accrued by the already rich class. General working conditions will worsen, social security measures will decline. And the common man will find it even harder to make ends meet. Almost 50% of our population is in agriculture, and contributes just around 20% of the GDP. 

Previously we had schemes like MGNREGA for rural poor, now the MP government has come out with scheme for giving money to urban unemployed youth. Why? Because there aren't any jobs being created. 

But all this doesn't matter.. because we are high on religious dogma. Been to Banaras....this makes sense as social courtesy but a law is a bit much ! Kal Pura desh. The correct decision would've been to disallow meat/liquor inside the temple premises (obvio), and disallow selling of meat/liquor around a certain radius. If they wanna eat meat stuff around the public areas near the temples, that's their choice,. Which should be allowed IMO. Liquor? Nope, keep that away. It's not about Pavitrata or anything, it's to stop irresponsible behaviour after overconsumption of said drinks. What do you peeps say? Too less/Too much? Banning meat anywhere reeks of Brahminism. I can kind of understand the alcohol ban around these sites, but meat? Seriously? The fuck is wrong with having a burger or a seekh kebab near a temple? Bakri hum ayege

They make use of whatever fleet exists. They don't make cars. The car companies should produce more electric cars at better prices and then due to the lower operating costs of those electric vehicles, I would imagine the market mechanism would lead to a higher percentage of electric vehicles in their fleet. Kindly do this for 100% of diesel autos in tier 2 cities. Hey India, can you also charge zero import duty on electric cars? Would be hard for someone who already has a car to switch to an electric one. Could be inforced to people who are entering this market but then I am not sure what the supply is for the said electric cars is...

NITI Aayog Proposes To Convert Two-Wheelers Below 150 cc To Electric By 2025,96,c3m8qb,https://auto.ndtv.com/news/niti-aayog-asks-2-3-wheeler-makers-to-present-ev-conversion-plan-in-2-weeks-2057273,31,1561213273.0,,Raymon_Morgan,Policy/Economy," Please BAN those shitty govt buses which emit black smoke

Same for transport trucks etc Why would people buy them when we don't have the infrastructure to charge all those vehicles. 

Let's say they encouraged people to simply charge their giant batteries directly from the  home socket, can our decades old power grid, which was never designed for this, even handle all that load of so many people charging their vehicles at night all at once. 

I think the toughest part of this problem is not introducing or selling EV's it's building or replacing the infrastructure, which will take a lot of time and money to do. To go fully EV we need to massively improve nationwide electric distribution systems. Yet to see anything from NITI ayog that makes me believe their lofty promises. Half of the schemes they make are outright scammy and promote oligopoly. 

Those who don't know, please look into the targets of FAME I AND FAME II schemes. In fame I they said 100% EV by 2025 or 2030 and now have rationalized it to 30 35% EV by 2030 that too with a term ""at best"", meaning such a target probably won't be reached üòÇüòÇ

Now don't start jumping on the numbers, I roughly remember them, not exact ones. Can someone do the calculation for how much it costs per km for petrol v diesel v electricity? I think it might actually cost more to operate an electric vehicle in India So Activa is going electric! Also some said they can make Mumbai as Shanghai These low cc bikes are primarily used in the towns and villages. 

Importing EVs costs nothing and can be done at anytime. But how do I rely on an EV bike which takes hours to charge in a country where electricity infrastructure is in shambles. EV which depends on supplies of extremely polluting rare earth mines are not the future. HYDROGEN. All these proposals yet nothing concrete in the way of subsidies and infrastructure

Look at China. They had the same environmental problems as us but they aggressively backed electric nearly a decade back and have transformed their automotive sector I heard somewhere that electric vehicles are not environmental friendly.

I was looking to buy a laptop a few years ago and it hurt to pay as much as I did because you can get ones that are so much better for as much as I paid in other countries. 

But there's nothing we can really do about it. Oh well. Wait for 2-3 months, google comes to their senses when only a couple of devices get sold in that much time. Good luck trying to win customers at 39k when the more powerful OnePlus 7 is launching soon. Sure the Pixel has a superior camera but we will see how much improved the OnePlus 7's camera is. Weird considering that the S10+ is for $1k in US (no tax included) and is for Rs. 73,900 in India which is basically $1k but includes all tax so is cheaper in comparison. Why would Google choose to have it more expensive here is confusing. Cries in Rupees.

Side note: Fuck not having a headphone jack on the premium version tho Import duties. Just doesn‚Äôt make sense for a lot of products. For example, GPUs cost so much in India. Sure try to incentivize production in India but pretty sure TSMC won‚Äôt open a fab in India anytime soon. Indian tech prices are usually high.

Don't even go into graphics cards and CPU and other PC part prices because the difference is ridiculous.

I can build a PC in the US for less than half the price of what I'll need to build it in India. I was shocked to see the price of the 2080Ti. The Zotac AMP! edition is about $1700 üòÇ

Funny thing is most tech is supplied from China and other oriental countries. So it's nothing like US is manufacturing it in-house. The source for both is the same

update: also, we are much closer to these supplier nations. The logistics should be relatively cheaper for India And even after all this, they are tagging it with a ""budget smartphone"". They need to understand the Indian crowd for the very least, people will definitely go with oneplus at this price segment, or any other 1 year old phone like the S9. I don't see any point in paying so much price and I consider LG V30 to be a better option at almost half of its price, even though it's 1.5 years old because it checks all the boxes. $399 in US is before tax though. I had got a new Pixel 2XL during the Flipkart sale for like 31K. The camera is insane However everything else is just mediocre. The 3A is a value purchase for between 22 - 25K.

"Venom, venom, venom. BSNL engaging in code injections.",740,bpp5bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpp5bc/venom_venom_venom_bsnl_engaging_in_code_injections/,102,1558114856.0,"https://i.redd.it/pasrqtt6sqy21.png

## Highlights

* **Background:** IFF has received an increasing number of reports through its online reporting tool, of various net neutrality violations. A particularly interesting response also informed us of browser injections by BSNL.
* **Need for security:** BSNL's disregard to the security of their networks is alarming given the sensitivity of the nature of information transmitted in these fields. We ask BSNL to take necessary recourse in addressing the issue.

## Background

In [**our previous posts**](https://internetfreedom.in/what-a-week-updates-from-savetheinternet-on-website-blocking/), we introduced our online reporting tool to keep a record of Net Neutrality violations around India. One of the responses that stood out informed us of browser injections by BSNL permitting advertisements, on non-HTTPS sites. We decided to look into the issue further, which led to the discovery of numerous public complaints on social networking platforms and discussion forums of similar injections.

## Venomous code injections

Techniques such as code injections are generally used to gain unauthorised access to systems, compromise the integrity and safety of sensitive data or deny access amongst other significantly detrimental consequences. After learning of its prevalence within the BSNL services, it led to concern not only the security of the information involved but especially the illegality of their actions, so we put it to the test against various frameworks in existence.

* **The Information Technology Act, 2000**Section 43 of the Act provides various protections to information that is within a computer resource, in order to maintain its integrity and security from unauthorised attacks. Hacking of a computer system deceptively, in such a manner, would even render one punishable by fine or imprisonment under Section 66 of the Act.Not only is injecting code done without the knowledge of the individual, its purpose is to undermine the vulnerabilities of the code to fulfil its own agenda.
* **Cellular Media Telephone Services Agreement**As far as we could find, BSNL is governed by the provisions of Cellular Media Telephone Services agreement which specifies in clause 44.4 that the Licensee (BSNL) is to ‚Äò*ensure protection of privacy of communication and ensure that unauthorized interception of messages does not take place.*‚ÄôPermitting such insertion of code definitely permits unauthorised interception of the original code which in all likelihood puts in jeopardy the security and protection of the privacy of the transmission. This is in clear breach of its own license conditions.

The Department of Telecommunications also circulated a notice providing for minimum requirements of security to be met by Licensee, in line with the DoT‚Äôs licensing conditions in May 2011. It specifically expects measures to be in place against intrusion of malware, protection of information in networks and its facilities, basic updated security measures in compliance with statutory, regulatory, licensing or contractual obligations. BSNL appears to be clearly failing to meet these requirements.

So we decided to write to BSNL stating exactly this; explaining how it is in contravention with a multitude of provisions ([**Read it here**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q7aFOmqCOzvRaoifMheTOE16AdRTmI-b)). In addition to this, we have also attached to this representation, a compilation of various reports of such code injections. Such thorough documentation has only been possible to the proactive users of India Broadband Forum, Twitter and Reddit (you guys have led us to some pretty intense discussion forums).

We provide BSNL with some necessary next steps, provided below, ¬†in not only addressing the issue but to provide some accountability for their lack of redressal over user complaints.

* **Investigate**: Formulate a working group to coordinate the legal and technological departments and then conduct an official audit, specifically investigating each reported incident and identify the reasons for its occurrence in different geographies.
* **Disclose:** Public disclosure of the findings of the audit and take the proportionate corrective measures.
* **Fix:** Take immediate actions in the interim as well as standing instructions which may be considered to prevent recurrence.

We are optimistic that BSNL will pay heed to our representation and take needed action. ¬†We do mention that in case of failure to do so, IFF fully intends to move forward with strategic steps to approach Government authorities including CERT IN and the Department of Telecommunication to bring awareness and the required response in strengthening existing security measures.

China did this transformation very sucesfully . We should be able to do this in ten years I would support this decision, but the current crop of EVs are too bad, they cost too much, their battery die in a couple of years, go too slow, have low range. It's kinda regressive, tech should be advanced first for more efficient and cheaper EVs. Unable to quote from mobile, but there is a bullet point about two wheelers with engine capacity upto 150 cc should be powered by electricity. What does that mean? If we are moving towards this, I am genuinely curious why we are not considering bicycles as an option where it is feasible. With bicycle lanes and security for riders, we could reduce our emissions more than switching to electric vehicles. Does fuck all environmentally because we'll still be producing a bulk of our energy using coal.

This works only when we work on producing clean energy. I know someone who made an investment in this field - and lost the shirt off his back.

Poor govt support for 3 wheelers, which then disappeared, bad designs and more.

I'm guessing space will be made for someone like UBER/Major firm to make/fund the fleet, and find the drivers. Once its done, they own the charging stations, road sensors, and all the travel data. 

This discussion of early adopters is moot. Aether and others are gonna benefit a lot. I am not sure how the OEMs are going to take this news. Their back are already broken from BS4 to BS6 transition. It's already giving sleepless nights to majority of the industry (yours truly included).
Also, timeline is quite unachievable with the R&D, prototyping, testing and final production version. All we are going to see half baked products.

TLDR; Auto industry will unleash an insomnia driven zombie apocalypse on the country. Electric vehicles are waste..if the source of electricity comes from coal. Oh fuck off. They said the same thing for cars, and then retracted it down to 30% or something after the car companies raised their voice.

Even that 30% electric cars by 2025 seems highly unrealistic at this point.

BEWARE: Online money fraud using Google Pay (please help spread awareness),126,bzcskn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bzcskn/beware_online_money_fraud_using_google_pay_please/,42,1560290136.0,"First off: YOU CAN REQUEST MONEY FROM OTHER USING GOOGLE PAY. This is something new compared to the other traditional payment and money transfer services. 

What happened:
I had put up a sell ad on olx for a cycle. Got a call by a person impersonating to be an army personnel saying his child really liked the cycle and he wanted it. He was posted away but would pay right away and the family would pick it up later. 

He insisted paying through google pay. On sharing the QR Code, he proceeded to *request* a large sum. When I called him out, he gave me non sense saying that it‚Äôs google showing me his account balance and I just had to accept. (I‚Äôve been an active user of GPay so could figure what happened). He was on call during this pressuring from the other end. I declined and requested the money; he hung up and blocked me everywhere. 



When I posted about this to Instagram today to help create awareness, a friend‚Äôs friend had actually lost 10K in a similar manner in the same way. 

IMPORTANT:

1. People can request money from google pay.

2. You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúaccept‚Äù to receive money. 

3. Beware of potential buyers with a sympathetic story (especially when it‚Äôs unasked for). 

4. If you do lose money this way, contact the cyber cell. Google pay uses UPI and each UPI ID is linked to a bank account. 

_________


Be careful when post ads on quikr/ olx / Sulekha. You‚Äôre contact is put out there.

If people insist they pay before they even try to understand what your product is, RED FLAG. 

Olx / quikr etc need to figure out better privacy settings. 

GooglePay- I don‚Äôt understand why‚Äôd you have a ‚Äúrequest‚Äù feature on a payments app?!

2.  Can you help me report this to google?

At this stage anyone will realise that you are paying the fraudster and just stop the transaction. Except well you are an elderly guy no one will fall for this It's a feature of UPI apps in General. Payments can be ""Requested"" to you by intended party, and you can accept, if you really want to.

It's an important feature, used by third-party apps like BMS, that send you a request from their UPI channel, requesting the exact amount. 

However, it can be exploited against those who don't know about this feature. Hence, when you're being insisted to use UPI-based apps, please be careful.

In GPay, the prompt for payment can be identified by a dashed prompt, unlike a complete bubble, that shows a sent transaction. A slight offtopic suggestions, let me know your feedback-

While internet transactions, NetBanking asks for OTP to complete it. Can the format of SMS be detailed like:

**OTP for transaction of amount - Rs.420.00 with vendor - FLIPXXX is 123456789. Please cross check the amount and vendor before further proceeding to prevent fraudulent activity.**




During transaction, amount and vendor name should be mentioned in OTP webpage, so as to match with SMS.


Yes, we are always in hurry to complete transaction to avoid session timeout, but atleast change in sms format can be little helpful. As it will have amount details and third party with which we are transacting. You know this is a failure of our police/judiciary. Each upi account is tied to a bank account and a phone number. Telecom and banks both do kyc. It should be extremely easy to catch these people. If fraudsters  still commit fraud without the fear of police and justice system, it's a failure of the system.

It sucks that world's largest democracy still fails at such a fundamental level. How can we ever expect to become a superpower without radical reforms to the police and judicial system. This is a very popular fraud where people will tell they are stationed somewhere else and such. I have seen much of these in US, especially for iphones and such. They will say they will pay extra to hold and pay using cashiers check or western union or paypal. This is actually quite widespread. So much that PhonePe blogged about it.

My brother lost around 4k for the same process. Upi should have paypal like chargebacks. Or at least a otp msg stating that you are about to send a payment of xxx rs put this code to confirm. Also, the request feature is available on almost all of the major platforms such as HDFC's PayZapp and PhonePe for easy transactions. Like business can easily request an obscure amount of 7239 without the user needing the account details or UPI details of the beneficiary.

Ayushman Bharat an Eyewash to Hide Govt‚Äôs Failure to Provide Effective Healthcare: Doctors at AIIMS,101,byu6ot,https://www.news18.com/news/india/ayushman-bharat-an-eyewash-to-hide-govts-failure-to-provide-effective-healthcare-doctors-at-aiims-2073437.html,53,1560174981.0,,homosa_penis,Policy/Economy," they need to be careful about their morning walks I just wanted to make a general comment here. Health insurance from a health care industry prescriptive does more harm than good in the long run. One of the main reasons US health care system is so messed up is due to private health insurance companies.

When you initially introduce health insurance to a general population that never had insurance before, it is beneficial for both the company because they have low pay outs (profit) and it is great for the person who bought the insurance because they have low premiums and they get good coverage when compared to the premiums they are paying.

Hospitals see's that they can charge insurance companies more than they would usually charge a normal individuals so they start preferring insurance patients. Hospitals also realize they can make a higher profit when they focus on reactive care than the pro active care they were initially doing. Everything/everyone in the industry starts following this tread.

Over a period of time, the insurance pool base (people) get older/sicker and insurance companies start increasing premiums. To make up for this insurance companies starts to add people which just makes the situation worse.

Luckily for India the Central Government has a strong hand in medical education so this allows for high volume of medical personnel to graduate every year where they received medical education that can be seen as ""affordable"" for the most part, especially from an international prescriptive.

The Indian government also runs hospitals which ensures prices are not gouged by the private hospitals.....

edit: why would anyone down vote this? at least leave a comment why you would disagree Govt's ability to provide effective healthcare shouldn't necessarily have to do with them employing doctors or building hospitals. 

I would argue that Ayushman bharat is actually a better model of delivering healthcare than managing hospitals. Market forces automatically weed out the poor performing hospitals which would have languished under public management. 



> Dr Pratap Sharan, professor in the department of Psychiatry at AIIMS, said the government is shifting its stance from providing services to purchasing services mostly from the private sector and ""it is an abdication of its basic responsibility.""



We tried for 75 years to provide  public health Care. We failed spectacularly. So government is now telling poor people to go to private hospitals and we will pay the bill. This is a good thing.



If these ivory tower residents had their way, they would try to provide free public healthcare for next 75 years, and again fail in it spectacularly!



And I have close experience of public healthcare for five years. These doctors are all funded by the Italian mafia. Do people really take care of themselves and their health? How much can govt help. Fucking leeches. By nature, strong survive, weak perish. Modiji is just trying to accelerate the process. An insurance led model can never be a success. Narayana Hirudalya is doing a good job (and that's because of an ideological and smart founder) but not others.

When banks can't even deliver in rural areas and have been found to be spectacularly corrupt , why Randians think that private healthcare in absence of a excellent govt. sector would be efficient is beyond logic.

One of the worst things we can do as a society is to fucking copy the American insurance model , it's worse than cancer. n+1 doctors coming up soon to say Ayushman Bharat great. Old article, March 20, 2019 Two things.

First one is that Ayushman Bharat has actually helped many many patients coming to AIIMS. Many procedures costing about 1 lakh get totally exempted. It has been a great help to many patients.

Secondly, the Doctors we are talking about is just an isolated group of Doctors, they are in no way representing the majority of Doctors in AIIMS. Few of them have passed out from AIIMS and are using its name to further their political ambitions. Not to say they are wrong, but they don't represent majority of AIIMS doctors.

Further, though Hindi is the first language of around 43% of people, according to census 2001 if one knows Hindi, one can communicate with around 53% of Indians. The second language which comes close to Hindi is English which has 12% speakers.

The urban elite however doesn't need to know more than English if he doesn't venture out to rural India. How many languages are first choice in more than 12? What is the first choice of people by state?

These are not provided in the article.

Also, the graphs in the article have their axes flipped. Further, I only see 11 states/UTs that choose Hindi as their first language, not 12.

I always tell the caller that I'm gonna report them. 1/4 callers actually shit their pants and beg me not to. Idea just says they couldn‚Äôt find any error. So the format is


CallerName,Contact,Date

Is it? [deleted] Why are you hiding the identities of spammers? 

I use the TRAI DND app on iPhone to send the SMS in the required format. So far, Airtel has blocked 2-3 numbers. This used to work for me, but has failed with a particular telemarketer.

&#x200B;

The call does not give any details about the caller : it only says ""If you are interested in lead marketing blah blah blah, press 1"", the call comes from (I think) Jio landline numbers (the landline number starts with a 7 and the spam callers seem to have 50-100 numbers since only the last 2 digits change) .

&#x200B;

Airtel closes all DND complaints about these numbers with bogus reasons and even mailing the appellate authority results in meaningless responses.I was able to determine the caller was from a site called indiamoney (they called my secondary number as well, and I pressed 1 on that number), shouted a bunch of insults to the spam caller but Airtel refuses to act on these complaints. As per the spammer, they are required to make these calls as a SEBI initiative and SEBI gives them my number. Dafaq

&#x200B;

/rant On Vodafone Mumbai you register for DND on their website and no more such msgs It doesn't work. At most they'll ban the number, which you can do too by blocking the number.

And all that time wasted in reporting is just ice on the cake.

I've been reporting since last year. I've observed these spam calls frequencies increase in a particular time and then after sometime frequency reduces. But Again after sometime we're back to base zero. I generally answer the call, just to be able to report it üòÅ

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pzckT6ns2H1IlmwYwJa8EnBh_1u3gRA9cEOoA4zfilc

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uEeTDdu58z8nVLbBG8o1qY2xbOhlb9TRVx5COnw2ZiQ Well therapy and seeing a psychiatrist are different. The psychiatrist will charge for the usual visits like any doctor and then you pay for the medicines and any follow up visits.

Therapy is more expensive and time consuming. The cheapest therapist I know charged Rs. 600 per session. The two therapists I've been to charged Rs. 800 and Rs. 1000. But you have to go every week or so for a while. It's a sad reality but many people who need it can't afford it. But if you can **therapy is worth it**.

EDIT : This is important - make sure you go to a qualified therapist. By qualified, I mean that person has either a **post grad in psychological counseling** or an **MPhil in Clinical Psychology from a RCI registered institution**. There are many people who just claim to be therapists and scam people for money, and it's disgusting. Do not hesitate to ask for your therapist's qualifications. Also, ask what session timings they have - therapy sessions are usually 50 minutes long. **Do not accept anything less than 45 minutes.** Do not tolerate behavior like checking phones etc, while the therapist is talking to you - unless they have an emergency. Remember **you're paying for the session.**

Also, not all therapists suit all people, you might have to visit a few to find one you like. Sadly, psychiatric meds are also like this - you might need to try various types before finding one that suits you.

Therapy is not like going to a dentist where all you have to do is lay back. **Therapy requires a lot of work on your end**, and it is going to be quite hard - **change is hard**. Put in the effort, and give honest feedback to them and you'll hopefully see faster improvements.

Good luck. It is basic demand supply rule.
Thanks to the modern lifestyle more people than ever are facing mental health issues and psychiatrists are obviously going to ask for more price since demand is more than supply! Caring about mental health is a very 'rich' problem, hence the higher costs Pharmacist here. 

Healthcare in India is cheap AF. So much so that it hurts our business ( kinda )

Government hospitals have DOTS programme for tuberculosis. 100% free. Preggo women get free suppliments from government hospitals, almost free  tubal ligation and vasectomy, you get free HIV test kits from gov hosp, cheaper blood tests, there's Rajiv Gandhi insurance too which is dirt cheap. Government hospitals and trust funded hospitals have good doctors which charge less than 50 rupees for consultation, basic meds are always free in government hospitals, government has jan aushadhi shops which have many generic medicines for very less price, government hospitals also have generic meds which cost 30-50% less than branded ones. Most surgical procedures are 10-20% cheaper in government hospitals. 

My advice is to get insurance first. Look for good psychiatrists and check weather they also visit government hospitals ( many do ). 

> Do you think mental health care professionals over charge or is it justified?

I kinda think they're on the expensive side. But you gotta consider how hard and expensive it is to become a doctor. 10 lacs / annum for 6 years then internship and other specialty course. You also gotta consider expenses of running a hospital ( if it's a multi specialty one with beds ). So i think it's kinda fair but expensive nonetheless. As someone who travels with family to India to get all health check ups done, you don't know how good you have it here. It's not that we can't afford health care in the US, it's just that we are Indian and know that it'd be less than half as expensive to travel here, get shit done, and go back.

Also, top grade Indian hospitals have international level of record keeping so it's smooth as hell if I need something checked out at home in the US. The maximum I have come across in Hyderabad is Rs. 800/-. üòí

There's the Rorschach test that the psychiatrist ordered which cost me 1500/- back in 2013/2014 .

Then there's the cost of the drugs. There is the supply demand rule. There are not a lot of mental health professionals in India.
Then there is also the years of training they receive. And every patient has to be attended for 1 hour or so.
I think their rates are pretty reasonable considering the kachori seller with 70lac turnover. Get insurance ASAP. It is.

This is directly because of the company based medical insurance culture we are importing from the US - the worst healthcare system in the world.

If the insurer is paying the costs, then the insured don't care how much it costs, and the hospitals raise prices. In turn, premiums go up.

Now the premiums become expensive, and the healthcare payments unaffordable.

&#x200B;

Edit: A word Why do we expect the world from someone? He has achieved so so much but everyone will always talk about how in his last performance he didn‚Äôt do this or that. Sachin has to go through the same. Stop focusing on one thing and look at how far he has come in his career. Indians are just never happy, it‚Äôs sad. They do the same with their kids. At least give a credit who made this. Why did you crop his name. Downvoting as OP cropped out original creator 's name.. that's theft. Why do you have to keep reminding us :( Sigh..Does not matter how cool you are.. This will probably haunt him for years. I cannot imagine the plethora of emotions that would have been going through him since the start of that over. But, a big salute to one of the best captains and readers of the game, India has ever had. An incomplete picture at first because you cropped the artist name. Give credit where it‚Äôs due. This is quite unfair. He'll be remembered as a legend despite his last performance Lol, stop putting people on pedestals.", shreyansh08 shub1991 petersimpson33 harshalvsonawane baarish84 aurora1987 AfternoonFill Pratik5211 manchester249 ReeveCR slapthatvex
Did you know?,1925,cawlif,https://i.redd.it/ex7u8k8vs7931.jpg,123,1562679363.0,,AfzalOzil360,Sports," Inb4 people belittle Chhetri.

Nobody sane thinks he is better than Messi, but to pass the GOAT in a single metric with almost no support from anybody and playing in a tier 3 team is commendable.

&#x200B;

Before you rip on his opposition, look up Messi's world cup goals. Most of them aren't against top tier opposition either. Guys chill. Chetri is no way near to Messi or Ronaldo. But on an international level he's scored more goals internationally than Messi. It's just how it is. India is still budding when it comes to football. We're on an amateur level, and for a position like this, it's a great achievement for chetri and Indian football fans to be inspired and put in the effort like he did. This stat doesnt prove that Chhetri is comparable to Ronaldo or messi. It only proves how indebted Indian football should be to him. Actually yes Bro there is a little bit of a difference scoring against Kennya and scoring against Brazil, Don't mean to belittle our Captain but also don't want to devalue Messi. Apples and oranges. Chhetri is an asset to Indian Football but it is irrational to compare him to Ronaldo and Messi. It is true that Messi scored goals against shit teams but he also played and scored against strong teams under tremendous pressure.

Chhetri's goals have primarily been against tier 3 teams but they have been valuable to Indian football. It is about having the level playing field. And if we abandon that, then this whole thing has little to no merit. Goals against Bhutan in SAFF and goals against Germany in the world cup aren‚Äôt same. No I didn't. üëè People need to get over him being compared to Ronaldo or Messi. I know we go overboard when an Indian does great and that can be annoying, but in this case, there is literally nothing wrong in this comparison because it's just presenting the stats. Nobody in their right minds is saying he's even comparable to either of them as a player. But to do this with the Indian team setup (if it's child's play to do this against other Asian teams, then other Asian players should be at the top, funny how they aren't) and to do it having a better ratio than both of them (Ronaldo 0.55, Messi 0.5, Chhetri 0.64) is commendable no matter how you slice it. Also, I don't see how you can dismiss Chhetri's goals so easily. If you can count Ronaldo's 5 goals against Andorra or Messi's 3 against Haiti, you bet your ass you can count Chhetri's 4 against Maldives. Especially when you consider India isn't comparable at all to Portugal or Argentina. This is not an accurate metric though. Chhetri is a great player but the teams he scored the goals against weren't exactly world class, were they? Imagine what Portugal or Argentina would do against Tajikistan.", chityo-ki-fauj AfzalOzil360 FleetingFlings navnee8 prithvitulsiani Burncaloriesfolks howimetyourfairydad okkeepyoursecrets NorthJury ericdryer Holypatchouli

It must've been quite a journey for these athletes to compete in an almost unheard of sport (in this country)

I'm glad to see so many more sports come into the limelight in the recent years. Kabadi and football come to mind. Wow! Never knew this sport was played and practised in India. That too at such a high level.

Must have been some struggle for these girls to reach that stage. Hope stuff like this gets more coverage and support in the future.

Congratulations! You girls are the real deal. The fact that some of us didn't even know we had a rugby team shows how unsupportive India is in sports except for cricket.

>Still i have played twice the number of matches you have played and i m still playing. Learn to respect ppl who have achieved.i have heard enough of your verbal diarrhoea.@sanjaymanjrekar I feel people supporting Sanjay in this issue are the ones who don't watch cricket regularly. We do love strong opinions and a bit of banter. But he is biased and stupid. He has very inconsistent tone and opinion. 

&#x200B;

Anyone who regularly listens to commentary will understand that. We cannot bring all the issues into one umbrella. 

&#x200B;

I was super against the embargo on Harsha. That was unacceptable. But I want Sanjay to be out of the commetary box. I don't want a guy who speaks just for the heck of it, I want a guy who means what he says and understands it. Sanju Manju can hardly be called an expert, he is just an average English medium cricketer masquerading as a commentator. He couldn't have been more accurate by calling himself a ""bits and pieces"" cricketer. 

> Sanjay Manjrekar pursued technical perfection like a man obsessed, but for a batsman hailed as the next Sunil Gavaskar, he ended up with a career that was largely unrealized. 

\- Cricinfo on Sanju Manju

Edit: Holy shit, yes we all know that you don't have to be a chef to identify food that tastes like shit. And, Sanju Manju is a cricket analyst and he is paid for voicing his opinions. It's just that he's been too cocky off late and to trivialize Sir Jadeja's achievements during an ongoing high profile tournament was below the belt. Sir Jadeja was once a upon a time amongst the highest ranked ODI bowlers, so his comment doesn't hold water like his opinion that doesn't hold logic. Someone had to call him out, glad that Jadeja did. This is such an unprofessional comment coming from an Indian national cricket team player. What has this country become? Why are we so intolerant towards criticism?

And how is number of matches even a parameter of the ability of a player?

Also, he may not have been a good player but it has nothing to do with his analysing skill. Maurizio Sarri never played professional football in his life and yet he won Europa league* managing a messed up Chelsea FC and will now manage a football team with world's best football players.

This attitude of Jadeja should not be tolerated and he must be called out for it. I hated when Sanjay Manjrekar was heavily biased towards the India team during the Indo-Pak match to an extent that when Pak fielders were making some great saves, he was not even saying anything to appreciate that.

India right now.,704,c64y1k,https://i.redd.it/cqcaqn528w631.jpg,47,1561667484.0,,hk2k1,Sports," I think Dhoni's batting is really affected by the long tail. If he comes in at over 30, he has to bat out 20 overs and the only batsman after him is Pandya. The rest 4 can't even bat for 5 overs

His approach has always been to take it to the last over. If he doesn't preserve his wicket, the tail is exposed.

Keep in mind that Dhoni's approach has always been to minimize risk Well, the pitch was not as easy as it seemed. Dhoni read the pitch and instead of 300 total, they went for 250-ish. At the end, thanks to the last over we got 15-20 runs more. That's Dhoni for you. :) He just smashed 16 off the last over. Well this meme didn't age well I think he played a good innings 56 off 61, but he is not the finisher that he was. Dhoni should really come up the order, at number 4. Dhoni and Kohli can play the middle overs and then give others some room to just go and kill it without worrying about their wickets. And I think Jadhav should be dropped and Pant or Karthik be allowed to play at 5. He did something in the game today. Now time for this meme to die. Dhoni doesn't have to play at an explosive pace tbh. There are others to do that job (like Kohli, Pandya). This is not 20 overs game where it's important to maximise the score in few overs. He has evolved from being an explosive finisher to a responsible batsman who can hold the innings together. 

The fact that Dhoni is still on the pitch in last 2-3 overs itself is a pressure factor for a bowler. He counts on the bowlers to make mistake under pressure while backing himself up to pounce on it. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. Don't blame him bro... he is doing his best in every match. I think pandya should come before, strike hard and go. Dhoni tries to make it to the end because the bowlers wouldn't be able to bat, and that's okay but in the process pandya, with a great strike rate isn't able to play for longer durations and make more runs.

Also, I don't exactly know the nuances of cricket strategy but I think dhoni plays a bit too slow. Like in the match with afghaniatan, preserving wickets didn't matter in the final overs. It is probably better to strike hard get as many runs as you can, instead of not scoring and not getting out. Who knows, you might make plenty of runs. I also find dhoni struggling with taking even singles and doubles. Dot balls are way too high when dhoni is batting usually. He is not able to play spin balls properly. He makes some runs in pace overs. he has a plan, but it gets a little frustrating to watch his batting sometimes.

It's the fucking cricketers and bollywood celebs and politicians who should be making donations. I'm honestly very curious about donations in cases like this.

On the flipside, I have nothing against the cricketers... It's the janta that is to be blamed. Not them. They never asked us to turn them into celebrities.

Yuvraj for all round performance. It‚Äôs not an easy thing to win an world cup even with a good team. So many things need to go in your favor.

Don't forget Pakistan's contribution to India's victory in 2011 CWC. They dropped Sachin 5 times. And every Semi Final that India loses, makes me realize the importance of those 85 runs scored by Sachin Tendulkar in that tense game against Pakistan in Mohali. The team wasn't perfect. We weren't professional athletes like we are now, we had our flaws. But damn didn't we know how to win.

There was something special about that period. Like you knew India were good, but every win was special.

India now is a top side and more often than not I expect them to win unless they are playing a side like England. Somehow it just doesn't feel that special anymore when we win.

There was a group that wanted to remove Shastri and Co couple months before world cup itself. I wouldn't be surprised if Shastri has coached his last game as Head Coach.

1. Soft-spoken and do your work kind of guys
2. The stylish, be there at your face and aggressive attitude brigade.

Cricket Corruption | Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj | Netflix,127,bth74c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5DWJv1hiwM,57,1558957200.0,,teslaluvrs,Sports," I think  the 2008 Harbahajan Singh - Symonds episode should have been handled more maturely . It was more nuanced than that . Sadly Hasan Took the easy way out and decried it as racism. Man that interview with Lalit Modi ( another Modi ha ha ) was funny af The episode is fine. But tbh he doesn't stress enough on the fact that why BCCI  does what it does. India being the most populous cricket playing nation, generates the most revenue. Naturally it would want the major chunk of it so that it could be used to distribute to the state cricket boards. This would only help in improving the facilities in the country. It might not be the most morally right thing to do but it also is not that wrong. It is a classic capitalist move. Just another recent case.. Australia and England were allowed to withdraw their players from the IPL for world cup prep. South Africa also wanted to do the same, but India blackmailed them with the cancelation of a tour after world cup. The big three at work again!

Ps. This is only a rumour and very few articles came out. But Ottis Gibson (coach of RSA) publicly said ""It would have been great had our players came back earlier"" and there were commentators who were talking about it at times too. But yeah, it is totally plausible. This is classic american mentality when they bully instituations for thier countries bennifits..its justified.. 

But when others do it it's curruption...

BCCI bully ICC becuase we supply major chunk of thier revenue. India gives cricketers arround the world opportunity and money. So ya BCCI have every right to be selfish and use thier leverage. BCCI use that money to improve stadiums and give more opportunities to young players.

I am not going to deny that BCCI doesn't have internal corruption but its no where near the level of past.. and after all the scandals in recent past BCCI has realised that its in thier best interest to stay out of politics... so i see no reason to be angry towards BCCI now. Does anyone else find him annoying? BCCI surely is a massive bully. Ah yeah let me comment on others house made of glass while I sit in my comfort zone inside a well built fenced house.
I will only identify myself as an Indian while playing the victim card. 
Just sayin. I stopped watching IPL a few years ago as it became too many matches for me to care. Glad I did.

No cricketer that is playing for his nation is gonna give away his wicket for pr reasons that too in a ind pak match.

Your thoughts on e-sports,51,bwkqxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwkqxu/your_thoughts_on_esports/,48,1559652669.0,"I recently saw a video where the Danish PM visited the largest e-sports training arena and played Counter Strike Global Offensive (csgo) with their team.
E-sports has undeniably risen and still rising up to huge popularity levels

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

What are your thoughts ?",SlapMak,Sports," The main reason that esports hasn't flourished in India yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who don't play games are not educated about the potential of esports and it's success in other countries. Parents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real job.

Second reason is that we Indians don't spend a lot of money, especially on luxury goods, and good PCs are luxury. Hence parents don't feel like it's worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatile.

If we want esports to grow in India, we need to educate people about it. It was difficult in America itself to accept esports as a profession.

I listened to a really good podcast episode between The Esports Observer and Akshat Rathee from NODWIN Gaming where Akshat explains the esports scene in India and also explains why people cheat. It's a must listen for people interested in the esports scene in India. 

Here's the link: https://open.spotify.com/episode/28MfL8Mf8tlwIqvqnUPM15?si=FRP1PciSTuCXZaqJOm4BWQ Will only get bigger. It's inevitable. Danish PM playing with Astralis (considered best CSGO team ever) was just a PR move around their election time. That being said, a number of top-tier talents come from Nordic and Scandinavian region.

That being said, a career in esports is still not viable even outside, let alone here. If you're not a talent in a top org, bills become hard to pay. There have been many instances where talented people/ teams had to raise funds from the community itself. I don't know about other games, but Indian CSGO ""pros"" don't have the talent like the EU players. They are just way better. EU just owns.

Also to make big bucks, we ll have to invest time and money. Especially Esports. Also doing it unless you are absolutely sure? Investing thousands of hours practicing? Do you think the ""society"" will accept it? They ll just brand the guy ""addicted to gaming, gaming is bad, it should be banned"". Crosspost to r/indiangaming as well We need a break out star in a competitive game(like faker or sumail) so we can kick start more poeple in our country. We have teams but they are just so far behind international standards... But hopeful since we have so many tournaments now than compared to last decade... Unless people take gaming seriously nothing's gonna happen. Half of my friends didn't knew PUBG was a thing unless it hit the play store. I feel pathetic for people calling themselves gamers who play on mobile and despise PC gaming. ( My friends tease me for playing games on PC saying I have no life and shit and yet they play PUBG the whole day. )

Esports won't be a thing unless someone is ready to take flak head on from the Indian society. Our aunties and unkills who believe in doctor and engineer species only. I hope someone revives it.

In the few years I've seen some really great Indian born games on mobile gaming platform. They're not 10/10 but at least they're of the same quality we deserve compared to the western counterpart.

Recently our college was creating clubs. I wanted to make an Esports club badly but I realized 90% of my colleagues wouldn't know its meaning. The idea got buried. Even if I did manage to get the courage and tell my faculties I want an Esports club and explain them, I m pretty sure they'd laugh their ass off and forget about it next day. The general rat culture in our country does not provide a conducive environment for competitive games like Dota/CSGO to flourish.

We might have more players than Europe but the skill level is terrible I don't thing pubg mobile is going anywhere when it comes to esports. It's not precise enough cause touch screen for an event involving skill In my local area, a lot of gaming pubs host DOTA and CSGO tournaments.

But I believe it's gonna be a long while before esports becomes recognised over here. Give it another 10 years and it will become an Olympic Sport.", MesonicGore Bhaktiman theehtn SomeAsianName Improctor suzzhuzz insane_issac waahmudijiwaah nvidiahotdog DarkChronus1311 Lambodhar

It's like the Ikea of sportswear/clothing. Decathlon near my home organise events, from small walks for a cause to random cycling. Though a small town, it often has active participation of locals. 

Also, their staff are directly involved in these training activites, kinda makes the whole experience great. More than a shop, it gives a socialising platform in sports field. Thank you Decathlon, for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Asics, NB nervous.  These people have made their products like 50 -100 % more expensive in India as compared to the west.  Largely making common products out of reach for the middle class.  

Nike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement. So much so that when NRI travel to India they bring shoes as gifts to please my family. 

For context: A 100 $ Asics running shoe is  Rs14000 in India. What kind of business model is this? I'm going to decathlon for sure TIL Decathlon is French [deleted] Decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty. :)

Does decathlon pay really well or something. Reduced visits to Decathlon, because I end up spending more than I need to. The assortment is so good and the quality is first class. I just live their shop man so big and they let you try and play with things. Even the employees at store are so friendly and helpful. I wish more brands adopt this style, I'm hopping IKEA has similar experience. 

The store in thane had very friendly environment, they trusted customers and I've seen so many times people shoplifting so they had to start tagging and deploying security at stores. That's just sad. 

These Adidas, Nike, puma deserve this. Decathlon cares about sports more than money-making... I fucking love Decathlon. Amazing quality stuff at great prices. I just wish they make a shopping app. Or at least do something w their website.

Request Dhoni to remove Army insignia from gloves: ICC to BCCI,73,bxiedb,https://m.timesofindia.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/request-dhoni-to-remove-army-insignia-from-gloves-icc-to-bcci/amp_articleshow/69678580.cms,33,1559865620.0,,buzzenwired,Sports," I don't see anything wrong with wearing gloves. Dude is an honorary army man, supports the army... What's wrong with that? It's just gloves. Trivial bullshit is trivial. I don't mind them asking Dhoni to remove the insignia as long as they don't entertain any other political gestures from anyone else. But the problem is far too many have gotten away with it. Enforce the rule strictly and consistently. Otherwise, their request carries no weight. How does it hurt ? Wtf ? Tributes are done everywhere , I get rules are rules. 
How does cosmetic change affect the game ? 

Can somebody enlighten me ? Yeah they have a point. Dhoni should instead go at the border and fight instead of playing sports if he can't part with indian armies even while playing. Good. request ? he should be fined. whats with request ? if he violated the rules..he should be fined. Social Media is making this matter more highlighted. There are some rules & regulations of ICC which should be followed by the cricket playing nations.

Both BCCI & ICC can make the decision by going a step back. Isko bhi PTSD de bhagwan. Aur gloves pahene se nhi hoga.", shaurcasm dustinge hear_m3_out bishopsandrooks CommunistIndia newinvestor0908 i-am-asshole MuhammadModi

Is cricket really that popular outside India?,12,c55wl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c55wl5/is_cricket_really_that_popular_outside_india/,16,1561484466.0,"I mean, the main issue I see with ODI cricket its just a big test of patience at times. Unlike any huge game, like soccer, rugby, baseball, hockey, etc. Cricket is just too too long.   
   
I loved ODIs during my childhood but nowadays I just can't help but say that IPL is infinitely more exciting than ODIs.    
  
Is cricket locally as popular in any other country? Except India or the subcontinent? I mean there are teams from plenty countries, but is cricket actually popular in the streets or base level there?",mylackey,Sports," TLDR - No. 

Real answer - ICC isn‚Äôt really interesting in growing the game unless it can find $$$ there, which is why it‚Äôll try to grow the game in the US but do jack shit for UAE despite being HQ‚Äôd in it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've been wondering the same thing. Currently in the US and there are a lot of British expats at work and none seem to be following cricket. I'm beginning to think that ever since the 2010s after India won the world cup, the game has become ""more South Asian"" for lack of a better phrase. Growing up in the 90s, it wasn't like this. British and Aussie cricketers were not just sports stars but we're also page 3 personalities. I don't think it is like that anymore. Does anyone remember Shane Warne and Liz Hurley? I believe there is a change in the demographic. As someone else mentioned in this thread, the Brits at work are actually more interested in the Women's soccer world cup than icc. I guess the grapes are sour? I would say outside the subcontinent cricket is a very 'niche' sport - it does have followers and some kids playing it, but not really big among the general pubic. Who gives a shit . Americans themselves don‚Äôt bother if their sports are popular elsewhere neither should we . Sub continent where a quarter of the world population follows it generates decent revenues for the ICC. Australia has proper cricket fans who aren't seasonal followers of the game #No I can tell that in the nordic regions, Cricket is pretty much a niche sport. There are a few clubs who play cricket but thats about it, the general public do not care about it. In the UK more people are following the Women's World Cup (soccer) than they are the cricket world cup.  Wimbeldon has started and so the CCWC is probably down to number 3 in terms of viewing figures.  In terms of general interest...it's niche. Nope, even Australia and England has stopped caring for it that much. Its become a niche sport outside of India.

And i believe the BCCI and ICC are responsible for it. Hasan Minhaj summaries it quite well in his [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5DWJv1hiwM)", BadAssKnight lIIIllIIIII witwacky opressedeldian7060 kaaficurious bs_dhani Elementst0rm kid_ying parth115

Fitness programs for randians,17,bxvrdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bxvrdp/fitness_programs_for_randians/,17,1559949212.0,"Hi everyone, recently I have commented on a post by a fellow redditor regarding gym trainers. I have mentioned there that anybody can message me regarding fitness advice and I have got quite a good number of messages ,I have replied to all of them ,some of them were regarding diet,some about weight loss and some regarding general fitness. I have been lifting for about 3 years and have even done a competition around 2017(I will include pic as well if anybody wants to see). After reading,implementing and going through multiple phases I can say I have sound knowledge on fitness. I am thinking of making fitness related plans such as weight loss,general fitness etc. Now you must be thinking that there are lot of resources out there and why we should enlist in my programs ,yeah you are right but the information on the internet is quite overwhelming . You may see hundreds of exercises but won't get a proper plan which suits your body and goal. Yeah you can buy a program too from any fitness guy from US,UK etc but they charge like hundreds of dollars and have hundreds of clients. The thing is I have applied lot of knowledge in my own physique and have been through ulcer etc due to hostel food which helped in finding more about my body. So I will be taking 10-15 people at starting making custom plans for them and will be charging a nominal fee. The best thing about the program is even of that nominal fee you can pay 60-75% at beginning and remaining after 4 weeks if the program is of 12 weeks. I will be checking on everyone that takes the plan weekly checking their progress, measurements , prescribing any changes. So that's all.

You can comment down and ping me if you are interested. 
Do let me know if this is a great idea.",u_sername_is_taken,Sports," Hey man, thanks for doing this.

I just need advice regarding calorie counting for Indian food. Is it really necessary if you just eat healthy food in general? And if yes, how do you count calories for Indian food? There are just so many varieties, so many different methods to cook the same thing that I just feel it'd be impossible for me to do this.

Another thing is I'm not too overweight. I think I weighed around 69 kg, the last time I measured it. I'm a little below 5'7"". So I think my ideal weight should be around 64 kgs. So I'm planning to lose weight first, and then start building muscles. I'm just doing intermittent fasting and some running in the morning. Is this the correct approach?

And finally, it's quite hard to have healthy diet living in hostel. Mess food isn't particularly healthy. Any tips you have regarding cheap and healthy diet for students?

But I'm not so sure about jail hygiene, from what I have heard about conditions in jail. Brilliant. Getting them to work. I don't understand why anybody can think this is a good idea. Looking at prison labor as profit is a dangerous slippery slope, not to mention that the laborers are being denied the fruits of their labor. This is highly unethical. No one should make money from prison or prisoners. If you don't want to waste the products prisoners create, give them for free.

IMO Basmati is actually a very boring rice and doesn't soak up the biryani masala properly. Fun fact: there's a spicy variety of rice named Kalanamak grown in Piprahwa (UP).

Bonus fun fact: If you get a chance to go there, make sure to visit the Piprahwa stupa, among the oldest in the world, and also the site from where the Buddha's bodily remains were excavated (and later gifted to the Thai royalty by the British to earn their goodwill). India has forgotten its varied variety of grains, India is also forgetting its varied variety of Bananas (North India has forgotten them). There are many indigenous foods India has forgotten or in the process of forgetting them. Rice and millet varieties are astounding. And delicious. I have zero clue why shops import and restaurants use so much quinoa from S America when foxtail is just as delicious and accomplishes the same thing from a culinary perspective. This was very informative. Thanks for posting Well be slave to mnc seed companies and follow IPR dictated by US.
Need open source seeds movement. The Edible Archives team mentioned in the article had set up a food stall with different rice varieties at the Kochi Bienalle, everything was phenomenal and I learnt so much. You guys should definitely keep an eye out for them if they pop up elsewhere.  


Some pics of the food:

As someone that grew up mostly eating short, thick parboiled red rice, mostly grown between Goa and Kerala on the West Coast, regular thin grained rice doesn't feel filling at all. But my mother always uses basmati for pulao, fried rice, biryani. It would be interesting to try the thick rice for making them instead. I loved biriyani...wonder how it's so tasty!! Any ideas?

Please feel free to take a look. If you feel overwhelmed by the catalog, I think you were referring to aloo lachha or aloo bhujia. You can buy this at your local patel brothers or any other indian store. India has a lot of variation in cuisine. Can you tell us which part of India was he from?

Just had Indian food for the first time. I am speechless.,240,bxojlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bxojlb/just_had_indian_food_for_the_first_time_i_am/,138,1559898490.0,"Hello /r/india,

I did not know where else to post this, so I hope this is appropriate. I've never in my life tried Indian food until today. Where I work, at the cafeteria, I decided I would try some Indian food. I honestly do not know what I even got.. to my regret.. I just pointed at something random and they served me a plate of this chicken with some type of thickish orange sauce (some type of curry?). It was honestly the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. Anyways, there's an Indian restaurant near me and I plan on ordering food there tomorrow. What are your recommendations of what I should try next? I'm thinking of a chicken entree. 

Here are my options for that:

https://imgur.com/uZ9XO4M",WinRARHF,Food," Personally I'm a non Indian who loves all things India. I'm a mostly white girl from Indiana. (no relation, lolol)

I love both butter chicken, which I think you had, and chicken tikka masala.  Those are great easy starters. A biryani is a meat mixed with rice dish. Unless it says veggie biryani lol. 

Tarka dal (various spellings) is delicious, that's a lentil dish.  Any dal is a lentil dish, those are staples and there are a million kinds but a few classics. Chana means chick pea.  there are ""saag""  dishes, these are greens. Spinach, etc. If it says aloo that means potato. Paneer is a kind of un-aged cheese, like queso blanco. Something described as pakora will be fried. 

Then there are all the pickles and chutneys. 

Most things will be richly flavorful but they don't have to be spicy the way a lot of people think about that word.

Edit: thanks for all the love on this comment. You guys are great. 

I'm going to admit some cultural appropriation here. I have a tattoo that is an Indian saying written in Sanskrit. It was r/India who helped me decide the best way to write it, and what you guys came up with makes it a paradox, which I love. It reads both ""a garland in a monkey's hand"" and ""a garland in Lord Vishnu's hand"". I got it as an homage to my love of India and as a reminder to myself to not be the monkey OR the garland. To be a good steward of the delicate and the vulnerable both in myself and in others. 

To those who might take offense that I did that, I am sorry. I know it's kind of gauche but I love my tattoo & get compliments on it almost daily--there are flowers around it, specific flowers with specific meanings, and it's done in a henna kind of style. Thus far, no one has told me that it actually says ""waiting for the number six bus"" so I'm hoping it doesn't... There's a high chance you just tried India's greatest gift to the culinary world - butter chicken. 

What you should order tomorrow really depends on what kind of flavours you like. Since you're just exploring, try the chicken tikka masala, and pair it up with a couple of naans of your choice. Did you buy WinRAR license? Hi OP ! There is a sub dedicated to r/IndianFood if you want to dive deeper. And you might get more nuanced suggestions there.  Also my choice from your list would be the 'Methi CHicken' as it will be completely different from what you tried yesterday(probably CHicken tikka masala. Ha-ha, welcome to your lifelong addiction my friend-take it from one who knows, once you pop, you just can't stop. I'm a 51 year old white guy from a provincial town in the UK. My first experience was aged 15 in an Indian corner shop called 'Johals' in my hometown. Knew the guys in there fairly well to talk to. Went in one day for milk and spotted a box of triangular pastries on the counter..

""What are those Mr Johal?"" 

""They're samosas RajBandar"" 

""What's a surmiser?"" 

""Samosa. They're nice, try one, free of charge"" 

I thanked him & walked out of the shop. Went up the road munching it, and despite the *tiny* amount of chilli inside blowing my head into orbit & making my eyes and nose pour,(I'd never tasted chili before this)  I'll never forget biting down on a freshly roasted cumin seed and letting that floral, earthy flavour bomb detonate and dance across my tastebuds. Twenty five years later I got on a plane at Heathrow for Delhi. In a happy miracle it all happened again! The Indian food I'd experienced at home was sort of the same but in India..my god, I can't describe the first time I had a simple thali and a garlic naan. I stepped into the desi elevator and took a straight vertical ride to food heaven. And a literal auto ride to Old Delhi. I could bore the shit out of this sub for *hours* rattling on about soft galuti kebabs, gossamer-thin rumali roti, daulat ki chaat disappearing on my tongue, *feeling* diabetes setting in after two gulab jamoon & some burfi from Haldiram, not caring and having more....etc etc. Even a simple masala chai on the corner and talking gupshup with the chaiwallah unkill while I drink it brings me deep joy these days. Especially when he opens the tin he keeps under the counter, opens it and offers it to me, saying *""Biskoot?""* 

If any other *gorapakora's* are reading this and thinking about travelling to India to sample her delights, edible & otherwise, stop thinking & do it., you won't be sorry. If you're anything like me you'll be unequivocally, incurably, head-over-heels in love from the outset.

Edit; I'm still getting on planes 12 ish years later and going to India. Trip number ten in the autumn and nine months has been too long for this masala junkie. I'm straining at the leash to get back, see you soon *Mataji Bharat* ‚ù§Ô∏è Chicken Tikka Masala is something I've heard a lot of non-indians like. So you can try that. Most of these are going to be similar to one another. No way this place has that much differentiation sitting around. I would go with Chicken Kadhai, it's a bit spicer than the others. Go for dosa and chutney/sambar during breakfast lol. Many non Indians like that..
Have tea/coffee along with that. Should be good. 

Tastes even better if it's raining outside! Come to India lol. You'll be mind blown. You should try biryani. Try indian sweets like gulag Jamie, rashgulla, jalebi", nomopyt shit_u_say junk_mail_haver ramamodh RajBandar s222n Brownhops LETS_GET_HIGHer Crocbro_8DN ApexLurker tilismilis

Zomato trying to earnback the discounts with these underhanded practices.,1220,braiqf,https://i.imgur.com/Pt2MdP8.jpg,95,1558474649.0,,wick29,Food," Zomato Takes a percentage cut from the price of every order they provide to the restaurant. These Handling Charges are consumed only by the restaurant and Zomato gets Zero cut from this specific charge. 

Let's see

You order two items of Rs100 from Zomato 50x2=100

Handling Charges Rs10 per item         10x2=20

Taxes on the items not on handling charges 5%= 5

Delivery Charge Rs 20

&#x200B;

You paid 100+20+5+20= 145

Zomato usually takes 18% flat if they offer delivery and 10% if the order is fulfilled by the restaurant.

Zomato took 18% from the base price i.e Rs 18

So the restaurant receives 145-5-20-18=102

The restaurant has to recover the cost somehow and Zomato encourages this style because win-win for Zomato and Restaurant

Honestly, Discounts are designed to drive more orders and you almost never get a good deal. You are still spending money after a discount in fact more because the discount made you purchase the item in the first place. I don't think that this is coming from Zomato, I think that this is a Burger King charge. I just checked swiggy and it's the same there, there is an extra RS. 29 restaurant charge, and that's dispite the fact that I'm a Swiggy Super member. Swiggy..Zomato..food panda...all same shit.

Just today I found a home delivery place with a nice variety and 0 delivery charge or minimum order within 2km

If we can figure out a way to give all local business this kind of power...all food ordering would be screwed.

If any body wants to collab on such a project ...pm me I never bothered with these apps. Restaurants near our home deliver free over a certain price point. Need to recuperate those costs from all those expensive advertising campaigns lol I always knew this was gonna turn into some kind of a scam since they had this 40% offer thing going on for months together and that got me thinking. The way they are making people outsource cooking food, is gonna hurt Indians in long run. Food is dirt cheap in India if you've habit of cooking your own food. But once you start ordering food from outside on regular basis, i think it's hard to hold on to your habit of cooking. What is Chicken Whooper?  probably their way of punishing you for ordering chicken on a tuesday It may be an unpopular opinion:

Fact: Handling charges go to the Restaurant not to Zomato. 

Opinion: You are absolutely more than welcome to drive in the Heat and save that amount! 
And next time, please tip those guys, they work in pathetic conditions. Zomato or swiggy prices are higher, if you go to restaurant and check menu and still they add handling charges", losetherobe randomusernameguy4 bluntdude24_psn BaidDSB SuperSaiyan1010 karansrajput UserameChecksOut vikaslohia nothinglooksgood Pratyush_p kriskris0033

Bubble Milk Tea?

It is yummy but it contains tapioca which is sago. I imagine it‚Äôll take some getting used to for Indians like me who like to dip a biscuit into a hot tea especially when the weather is nice. 

Indians just want a small cup of hot tea in most cases. Just a different palette. Many tea startups fail in India because they just don‚Äôt offer the low cost and simplified experience of a roadside chai stall.

Last but not the least, tea with a straw just seems non intuitive. I read it as Butter Milk Tea initially... was so terrified of the possibility of it.. I had no idea what bubble tea was but from reading the article. It seems like a cold watered down sabudana(Huge?) Kheer with no flavour to it other than sugar? No wonder people didn't like it. Problem with bringing any food to India, you make it too international standards and taste, you fail. I've never been to another country where authentic foreign food doesn't do well(withstanding middle eastern). If the concept is not from India then how can you expect it to be moulded like Indian tea? Ekh. Bubble Tea isn‚Äôt even that great. I‚Äôve had it thrice now and there‚Äôs honestly nothing fancy about it at all. Overly sweet milk with tapioca pearls sunk in the bottom which taste sour always. It‚Äôs literally such an Instagram gimmick

Like one doctor says in the article, basing conclusions only on food is wrong. Other factors should be considered. For example, what if the genetic trait responsible for lactose intolerance is also more prone to diabetes? The study has found that eating calorie-rich food like sugar and honey increases the risk of diabetes while addition of protein-rich food and dairy products in a meal can help reduce the risk of diabetes.  

 The study also found that eating protein-rich food such as pulses and nuts decreased chances of diabetes. Similarly, states where people ate more dairy products had low prevalence of diabetes 

Its more common in states like West Bengal and Kerala where people consume more non-vegetarian food than the States where diet is predominantly vegetarian.

The milk is what makes all the difference. Store bought paneer is no match to dairy one. I asked the same thing to the Restaurant we eat at, they told you can also buy it from the Dairy they bought it from. So its the Dairy. Ok , something i might add. Buy the store one , i dont about how to make good one at hone. 
Now u can stlightly brown paneer peices on tava with a teaspoon on ghee or butter. Then you boil them for about 3-4 mins in water so they become soft for your liking. Reintroduce to ur gravy and bam. 1. Good food starts at the market. 
2. Don‚Äôt overcook paneer. Add it only at the end of cooking and cook only for a couple of minutes. It‚Äôs not meat or poultry - though there‚Äôs something to be said about overcoming those as well. 
3. I keep paneer aside in hot water for a few minutes before adding it to the prep. 

Caution : I am just a dude that learned by making mistakes. Make sure you are using full fat milk. Buffalo milk has even more fat that cow milk so that might be a factor. Let the paneer rest in the fridge for a few hours before using it. As suggested by others, soak in warm water for a little bit before using and don't overcook it.

The paneer I make at home is usually super soft but it's somehow now as bouncy as the store-bought one. not sure what the secret to that is. Use lemon instead of vinegar.

Are pizzas overpriced in India?,87,bt4mjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bt4mjm/are_pizzas_overpriced_in_india/,116,1558879585.0,Not the Domino's ones. Real ones ? I don't quite get the pricing say in comparison to say biriyani or Indian dishes. Per head,braavosi19,Food," Yes definitely. A large cheese burst pizza is 800-1000 atleast which is absurd if you look at how cheap Indian food is available everywhere around us.

200 for paneer butter masala at my awesome local restaurant and 100 more for some butter and garlic nans. ‚Çπ300 can feed 2, sometimes even 3 people. I wish pizza and burgers sell at the price of meals. What are real pizza. ?! I live in a small city we only have dominoes or Pizza Hut ü§î Jamie's Pizzeria By Jamie Oliver in Mumbai is very reasonable, and with Zomato gold benefits it's my favourite pizza place. Good cheese is expensive. Most of the cheap cheese (Amul) we get here is processed cheese. Joeys Pizza in Mumbai. Reasonable and good. 675 is the max for a large pepperoni pizza incl gst Compared to other Indian food? Yes absolutely. Pizza isn‚Äôt very expensive to make, compared to a chicken Biriyani. The mark up on a pizza is much higher, because it‚Äôs an ‚Äòexotic‚Äô dish.

They mark it up so much because pizza is something you‚Äôd rarely venture to make at home, compared to biryani 

But you compare pizza prices with other countries, within the same brand (like Pizza Hut) you‚Äôd find that it‚Äôs much cheaper in India. But then you‚Äôd have to account for a lot of other factors, I suppose Hell yeah! We need more places that sell by the slice. Not everyone wants a whole damn pizza (not that I don't eat a whole pizza by myself sometimes). yo dominos is expensive too ! If you are referring to non-chains, 600-1200 can be justified for pizza. 

1. Sauce made from scratch takes a long time to make. 

2. Fresh mozzarella is expensive to buy and difficult to make. 

3. Some toppings are imported and cost a ton of money. 

Considering how much the chains charge, the premium paid on top of it is completely justified. Keep in mind that they also have much lower volume and higher costs, so they need decent margins to be justified in keeping the place open. Just had a wonderful fresh 10"" clay oven pizza with all the veggies at Karachi Bakery in Bengaluru shared among 3.

&#x200B;

Price: Rs 185. 

&#x200B;

Yes, we had to read the price twice on the menu to confirm. The pizza is really great and so much better than many of the 600+ priced ones at these fancy pubs and pizzerias around Indiranagar. So yes, most are way overpiced and maybe paying for the decor, booze taxes and various bribes that the establishment needs to recover.", panwarakhil tycoonrt harddisc Ash_Sss Beertard killswitch13 kappa23 serialposter shintobento nlu95 pla9emad

I saw many foreigners don't use gloves to prepare the Pizza, Many chefs rotate the dough in empty hand. Don't know how old the chicken / bacon is ? Most of them are processed food which is dangerous than non hygienic foods.

And their Pizza smells like shit to me. And they have more cancer patients compare to Indians (5th place in the whole world)

I know KFC is not even hygienic, Saw many controversies and some of their branches are banned in India.

But when it comes to Indian foods they say Ewww,  Yuck,... You Indians are dirty...

WHY THIS ?  


PS:  They say yuck to our homemade food too.",steveharrry,Food," Street food, is prepared on the street. 

Those pizzas, are prepared in a kitchen inside. Where they wash their hands and keep the surroundings clean. They have regular checks for any health code violations etc. 

That stuff isn't taken that seriously in India, especially with street food. No one cares how it's made. You're mentioning about street food and stating items like Pizza, KFC. An acquaintance of mine, a 3rd/4th  gen Malaysian Indian, told me his story. He visits India on business every 6 months or so. Once he ate street food. He went back and developed serious stomach issues much later. His doctor advised him that some viruses/bacteria (whatever) can remain dormant in stomach and show up six months later.

He eats Indian foods at home in Malaysia.  And strictly avoids street food here.

So, yes, some people do get sick from Indian street food. There is a big difference in hygiene between you random street gol gappe seller who dips his dirty hand into the water and a pizzaiolo handling the dough in the restaurant. 

I guess it is just due to them seeing different food from an alien culture. When I brought my grandma pizza for the first time, she was like dafuq is this shit, I can make like 20 parathas for the same price. 

Have you heard about Delhi Belly btw? 

I like both Indian street food and western food (except anything with potatoes), especially Italian food.  

And honestly Indian tasted great but can often look unappealing. Stop giving a fuck about them. Why does it matter? You say foreigners and then refer to them as having rank 5. Bolna kya chahte ho?

For your solace, they don't wash their ass after shitting. Just wipe with paper towel and boo! Ewww... The issue isn‚Äôt street food, it‚Äôs the water used in the preparation of those street food. I think there was a post on r/India about a pani Puri vendor filling water from the toilet...

Do you still blame them? Because it will give you rocket shits strong enough to propel you right to the moon.  Not because it‚Äôs spicy, because contrary to what you folks seem to believe we can handle our spicy food just fine, but because it‚Äôs covered with wind-blown dirt, dried dog piss and shit and all sorts of intelligent life forms breeding in those giant piles of garbage.

My question is can I drink it ? Will it be spoiled ? I don‚Äôt want to be sick",jedimomos,Food," Only one way to find out Wtf how can you not see the bottle for 1 complete year S I P P Depends on the quality of the original water.

&#x200B;

Few ways to check:

1. Does the bottle seem puffed?
2. Leave the bottle outside at room temperature and open it slowly. Is there a pressure sound of built-up gas escaping?
3. Pour the contents into another bottle, do you see any thread-like or mucous-like structures?
4. When the original bottle is empty, do you see any greenish growths near the threads at the top, or at the bottom?  
If the answer to all of the above is no, you're probably good to take the sip test -
5. Taste a bit and see if it tastes off. If all seems OK,
6. Drink a glass and see if you have any side effects the next day.
7. Bonus Pro tip: Keep activated charcoal powder (from a chemist shop) and salt water handy. If you feel poisoned, consume activated charcoal to adsorb the bad things in your stomach. Then drink salt water to induce vomiting. Then, after first-aid is done, seek medical attention.

*Typo edit 'versus' meant 'very'",nofap2010,Food," As far as my knowledge says, khoya is heaviest form of milk which has a high sugar and fat content. In addition to that if you talk about pedas, they are prepared by adding more sugar to it. Having said that, you can eat one or two Ina week if you are trying to achieve fitness goals. Of course fat is not as bad for us as people believed it 10 years ago. However most of the mawa etc. you find is shops is adulterated shit. So it's only best to limit yourself. Indian parenting is rife with such pseudo-scientific assumptions about health because of the whole Ayurvedic diet practices. People still talk about which food are ""hot"", ""cool"", ""wet"", etc. and ban stuff that are actually healthy. Most other fatty foods are demonized, but you can drink litres of ghee and nothing will happen to you. Coconut oil is heavily recommended here because Ayurveda says so when in fact it is a high source of LDL Cholesterol which is the worst. If you have flu, they ban milk products especially curds, and ban citrus juices of all the things when in fact it is one of the best things that you can have.

The worst part of all this is of course that they refuse to change their minds about this even when presented with evidence and studies. No one said it‚Äôs bad for health but don‚Äôt gorge on it. No one said it is bad for health to me. I grew up eating straight up khoya. I am just fine. Eat your pedas in moderation. Brush your teeth. You'll be fine. I grew up eating tonnes of khoya and mawa stuff, no side effects detected yet in my 30 years of existence... Nothing in excess is good. While those milk solids may not exactly be poison, the Indian sweets contain a very high amount of sugar which is quite unhealthy except when eaten very occasionally. It's fine to eat - it's just concentrated milk and sugar, the real problem is that it's typically adulterated, better go for Kaju ki Barfi , harder to adulter (and tastier imo).", bravo2062 Hk6919 El_Impresionante Ayr909 holdmybroccoli Axylius svmk1987 singthebollysong

Figuring out a cost-effective Indian Gain-It diet,20,bxhrjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bxhrjo/figuring_out_a_costeffective_indian_gainit_diet/,21,1559862325.0," 

I know r/gainit exists, and it has been really helpful for broad guidelines, but when it comes to diet planning, I find that a lot of the suggestions there are tailored to a western (and mostly NA perspective). Food pricing varies a lot from geography to geography, and a lot of the cheap suggestions on that sub aren't really cheap back here, especially in comparison to income levels. Add to it the fact that many of us are vegetarians too.

Hence trying to build out a list of food items, both bulking and clean; veg as well as non-veg. **Help me please people!!**

PS: A dirty secret that I've come across is ghee and coconut oil. Adding them to your Dal post cooking (I can't stand coconut oil though) helps you (at the cost of fats though).",mrehanms,Food," I'm in the same boat. I use an app called HealthyfyMe. I use the free version though you can pay (not recommended). There you can actually calculate your calories and macros by just putting the name and amount (if you don't know the exact amount, you can select katori/Chinese bowl/bowl/tea cup etc). 

They have loads of suggestions. You can also view the nutrients of all the food (including Indian). They even have Kachori in there.

The app builds a plan for you by your goal, age, height and weight and suggests food.

It's free and it's working for me. You can give it a try. [deleted] Not Indian but following in the hope of some good suggestions and recipes In before someone say ""Beer pene se body Banti h"" I usually gain/lose 10 to 12 kilos every year due to work so I might have a little insight.

You first bulk up like mad then you cut down to size, like every single body builder, power lifter in the world. Eat everything you can lay your hands on. Sugars and fats help the most. Dairy, eggs, bananas, cream, meat everything. You WILL gain weight but energy levels will vary with types of food.

Change your routine to power lifting. 3-5 reps of your One Rep Max. Don't exercise too much. Enough to stimulate diet and growth but not enough to start cutting.

Once you get to your target weight start cardio like mad.
Concentrate on red meat, dairy, eggs and fatty fruits. I put on 25 kgs with this approach. Hope it helps you too Unpopular opinion -- If you really wanna gain weight and have the discipline to lose fat then you might wanna read about Dave Tate's diet. Inb4 noobies start saying ""hurr durr you should clean bulk instead"" clean bulking is very very difficult if you're eating high protein/fat food(s). Bread + peanut butter + cheese + sprouts. Google some sprouts sandwich recipe. Each serving will give you around 25 to 30gms of protein. Have 2 of those, and 2-3 eggs for breakfast. 
You'll get around 70gms of protein at the start of the day in a single meal. 
Fill out the rest of your protein requirements over the day. 30 to 40gms over 3 meals ain't hard. Are the commercially available mass gainers carb + protein mixes no good?", I_Watch_Turtle_Porn None beefstockcube None berserkergandhi pureanalyst Lazenius ThokoMullonKo
#BoycottLays: PepsiCo giant slammed for suing small-time potato suppliers in India,198,bj2041,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bb31T4RHFM,51,1556651192.0,,kaddu_karela,Food," Someone should legally fuck Pepsi Co,  I don't believe India would allow such bullshit petants, especially in agriculture. this looks like daylight extortion this article puts forth the legal case for the farmers, and it makes a lot of sense

[https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/opinion-pepsico-farmer-lawsuit-is-a-misguided-action-1556647061633.html](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/opinion-pepsico-farmer-lawsuit-is-a-misguided-action-1556647061633.html) Not suing, rather bullying I would look forward to see what ex-Chairperson/CEO Indra Nooyi has to say about this. PepsiCo isn't really wrong, they have proper rights over FC5 potatoes and they are giving Farmers an option to either join them or they should simply stop growing FC5 variety. However, the court case is very rushed approach from them. More like boycott our judicial system. You are misinformed.

India has ratified the TRIPS agreement and to give effect to this agreement, The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act, 2001 (PPV&FRA) was enacted.

The main aim of this Act is to establish an effective system for the protection of plant varieties and, the rights of the breeders and to encourage the development of new varieties of plants.

http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/519652/Patent/Plant+Variety+Protection

‚Äã

PepsiCo holds the patent for that tuber variety ; https://patents.google.com/patent/US6762351B1/en

This is the basis of their claim. In case you are wondering, India is signatory to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/pct_contracting_states.html

US Patents must be respected in India. The farmers will lose this. No wonder they are clamoring for intervention now.

Pepsico is actually protecting their farmers who it has exclusive agreements with : http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ivc/PDF/Asia/15_Punjabi_potato_contract_farming_for_Pepsi_India_formatted.pdf

Suprise surprise, the corporation is not the evil guy here...the farmers have been stupid.

And the courts agree : ""According to the information, the court said that at this stage, it appears that the ‚Äúplaintiff has prima facie case in its favor.‚Äù Moreover, it noted that if the farmers are not temporarily stayed from growing and selling potatoes, the company would suffer irreparable loss."" https://www.potatobusiness.com/business-news/pepsico-sues-farmers-in-india-who-sold-one-of-its-proprietary-potato-variety-illegally/

‚Äã

So no matter the pitchforks that will be undoubtedly raised in the comments here, Pepsico is well within their rights and these farmers *will* lose this case. They know this, and so now some usual ""NGO/activists"" are making noise and begging for government intervention. A pathetic response to try protect individuals who have flouted the countries laws and trespassed on another entities rights. https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/activists-seek-centres-intervention-in-pepsicos-case-against-farmers-2028259 

‚Äã

I have zero sympathy for them because the case is as clear as it can be. They are simply in the wrong here and have infringed on the rights of Pepsico. Bio Piracy Any alternative to lays?

Ripening bananas also give off ethylene which triggers a group ripening orgy in other fruits. >Most fruits produce a gaseous compound called ethylene that starts the ripening process.

The actual price of it is 100 where as on Zomato it's 120 with some x% discount.

I only find Uber eats giving proper discount. The same thing on Uber eats costs 65/-. This is clearly McDonald's charging for the packaging and not Swiggy.

But you do save quite a bit of money when you order from your local restaurants. This Swiggy bitching is going out of control. People don't seem to realize that they are a company which has to make money. And they are making money out of our laziness. 

It's a market and you pay for the service. We seem to have a problem in general with paying for service and that's why we still keep arguing and bargaining with roadside vendors and house help while shamelessly coughing up money for shiny things in Amazon/ Flipkart. 

And if you fall for shady marketing tactics in spite of your education and upbringing that enables you to use such a service, you are a dolt. Uninstall and move on if you are so offended.

Delivery boy picked up the order from restaurant. Then he switched off his phone. I tried calling him 40 minutes after placing the order and he finally answered. Let me just quote what he said "" Aisai kaam hai apna to, kya karoge "". 
 
I contacted the restaurant again and told him what happened. He politely asked me to refuse the order and place a new order. There was a gap of 1 hour between my placement of the order and the first time he answered my call. Here's what happened next : HE CONFIRMED THE ORDER AS DELIVERED. that's right! Zomato chat support timer got stuck. Restaurant couldn't do jack shit despite the knowledge of what was happening. I was left hanging like a fool. 

Now I'm hungry, out of money, and will have to fight for my money just because order was pre-paid and that asshole confirmed it ( BTW restaurant did confirm that had it been a COD order, the amount would have been deducted from his salary ).

My question is, why so much control vested in delivery boy's hand? How is this not bad planning on Zomato's part?

2) COD always. Pay online only if not possible to do COD

And if you want to get something out of these apps, here's a tip,next time you get food, say quality was not good, 9/10, you'll get refund, you can do this 3-4 times a month, just try not doing every next day.

I feel it's criminally underrated in comparison to Hyderabadi and the others. It certainly isn't seen very often on restaurant menus outside Kerala. The outlandish combination of spices with sweet flavours could take a while getting used to but it's so rich and rewarding. Cashewnuts shallow-fried in ghee, caramelized onions, the essential boiled egg, mint chammanthi, pappadam, and a bit of lemon pickle to go with it all, oof.

It really is my favourite food of all time and every day I hope that it's the last thing I eat before I die. Nothing beats Hyderabadi biryani to me, I would eat it everyday lol. 

Awadi biryani is my second biryani of choice. It tastes just right and the good thing about it is, I can without raita! However I think the rice grain used in the biryani is very long and overwhelming to enjoy the dish. I wished they used regular rice grain from Hyderabadi biryani. My opinionated comparison, between the crown jewels:

Hyd Biryani: Too spicy, has an overdose of masala, and often feels like mutton/chicken curry mixed with rice. Often have to eat accompanied with Raita to tone down the spiciness. There is a good amount of ghee added but the scent/taste of ghee is overshadowed by the masala.

Kolkata Biryani: Too dry, low on masala, and an overdose of scent (kewra extract or rose water). Sometimes feels way too bland, and almost always is needed to be accompanied by some side dish.

Awadhi/Lucknowi Biryani: The beautiful love child of the above two, with just the right amount of spices, scent and ghee. Never feels dry or bland and the mix of ghee and masala complements and brings out each other's flavor. Can be eaten as is with no accompaniments (adding any ruins the flavor).  

If you're in kolkata and want to try the Awadhi biryani, try it at any of the Oudh's branches (dishes named Murgh Pardah biryani and Awadhi handi biryani). If you are in other metros where Faasos is operational, Behrouz Biryani does a good impression of the same. No love for kalyani biriyani? I really miss the Dindugal and Ambur Biryanis of TN in Mumbai. Does anyone here, know where you can find something authentic or atleast close to that in Mumbai? Doodh ki Biriyani?

Is this a new marketing thingy? Don't remember seeing it on Cafe Bahar menu few years back. What's the most obscure Biryani you have eaten? The actual National Food of India All biryani is best biryani. Fantastic feasts and where to find them Why is their Awadhi biryani from Delhi?

A vegan's enemy,15,bnkyuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bnkyuk/a_vegans_enemy/,48,1557662388.0,"Each time you search for a vegan place in India, you get 'vegetarian' results. The 'pure veg' places are a vegan's greatest enemy since ghee and butter are the norm.",Pedro303,Food," Veganism, as we know, is a western concept, and we're tad slow in catching up here, too, as usual. [But why?](https://youtu.be/K4smXP46tG4) What's the point of being vegan in India, unless you're lactose intolerant? Western veganism makes a point against animal cruelty, whereas cows are relatively well off in India (slaughter ban) and worshipped even for the most part. Being vegan means missing out on some of the best veg food though.

Edit: Chill, people. My comparison was being vegan vs being vegetarian in India, if that wasn't clear from my message. So your arguments about cruelty against other animals/poultry don't make a lot of sense to me. There's relatively less options to choose from, from Indian menus and grocery stores, for vegans. The vegan movement is not really that strong as of now in India. May be it'll take time or probably won't happen because of the typical desi diet. Can't Vegans eat *Vanaspati Ghee* like *Dalda Ghee,* which is made out of plants? Two things: one, India is one of the world's largest exporters of beef and leather.  Two,  kaju katli is Vegan,  yeah!! I am appalled by the number of people here on r/india thinking that dairy cows are treated humanely in India and that industrial farming is a western problem. How is it different from the old aunties and uncles they criticise for holding onto *kulcha*, etc.

OP,  as a fellow vegan I totally understand your frustration. Packaged food is not labelled properly. You won't get allergen/ingredient information most of the time. Don't even get me started on the lack of vegan alternatives like soy yogurt or nut milk, etc. Most people probably haven't heard of them. 

When I visit India, I usually go with the safe options (that I know from experience) at restaurants. Forget having any desserts (other than jalebi). The absolute cruelty is...so sad.

Zomato rider delivered the order but zomato is still levying cancellation charges even though i paid for it,8,c365y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c365y9/zomato_rider_delivered_the_order_but_zomato_is/,5,1561120646.0,"On 8 the june 2019, i had placed an order through zomato app from burger king using cod option for which i made full payment to the delivery boy who delivered me the burgers. As i was about to eat,  zomato' personnel contacted me and said that you had ordered twice so do you wish to receive the second order too to which i replied saying that i had ordered only once and had recieved it too...so he told me if you have any problem contact through email or chat support. So the second order was cancelled and now cancellation charges are levied.
Every time i call them, or use chat support or send them an email they keep telling their policy that if order is cancelled,cancellation charges can't be removed.
They didn't even cross check from burger king or check call records of their delivery boy as to whether i actually received it or not.
No acknowledgement is sent to me in respect of the order i paid for..only the cancelled order is shown in the order section of their app.
Also, Their delivery boy is lying..he gave me the order.. took the money but didn't update the order status..
So for one order i am basically asked to pay twice.

I have been a faithful customer and have ordered multiple times through zomato but still i am held accountable for this issue even though its not my fault.

Guys dont order from zomato app...customer support is terribly slow and awful and they take ages to resolve it..and then they say "" your issue is really old thus it can't be resolved or as per our company' policy we can't solve your issue"".",arshi0510,Food, I also HATE Zomato Customer service.

r/savedyouaclick Nothing is native to any place with everything has been originated someplace else. It's what they (the natives) make it out that's important. Indians developed those ingredients as their own and what came out was an utterly delicious extravaganza. There is simply no alternative to it in the World of food. Well it made Europeans to come here and take all of it. Yes Chilies came from South America to most of India, but I suspect they are also native to the North East and Indo-China - more research is needed - the idea that all capsicum came from the Americas is the generally accepted theory but indigenous varieties pop up all the time in the wild. Really nice article. Thanks for sharing it. I had my first ""Shradhaa"" last year due to my grandmother passing away. Eventhough it was a poignant occasion, the food was very memorable. Many of these dishes that are described in the article were made, and it was an interesting and flavourful experience. It would be pretty cool if the cuisine was made popular outside these occasions because I think they deserve it. It was initially hard for me to imagine food without the non-native ingredients, but the meal was really delicious.

Many food delivery operators and restaurants are delivering piping-hot food in these packets. Are they food safe and what are they made of?,196,baqs43,https://i.imgur.com/wHISEzc.jpg,41,1554737028.0,,rajeevist,Food," Maylar is actually safe for food storage. So, no worries.

This is from University of California:
""PET or PETE (Polyethylene terephthalate) laminate pouches are excellent food containers. PETE is a food-grade plastic with no known toxicities. Sometimes they are referred to as ‚Äúmylar bags‚Äù. This type of foil dramatically reduces the transmission of oxygen and moisture through the film. To store DRY food, use oxygen absorbers and a vacuum heat seal."" 
(site: http://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=18457) Yes its totally safe.  Its like tetra packaging but only thin.  It has 2 plastic layers and a aluminium layer in between Not every packet is safe only the good and reputed  restaurants are investing in packaging of food otherwise small ones are just using packs made from cheaper materials available at lower cost in market. i doubt this is mylar. just silver coloured plastic bags.  It is only the outside of the bag which has a metallic look. The inner side is white and *looks like* plastic and, *to my untrained eyes, appears to be worse* than the thicker grade transparent plastic bags they used to send food in before the plastic ban.

The ones that we get here in Pune, look like [this](https://www.amazon.in/Aluminium-Multipurpose-Packaging-Available-Quantities/dp/B07P2ND7DS). Click on the third picture to see the inside of the bag.

I have the exact same concern as the OP each time I order food. End result, I order from outside much lesser lately. It is very harmful to health - try to avoid these toxic silver coloured mylar lookalikes. I am poor but somebody give this guy a gold. This deserves it. I believe its a type of aluminium foil... It is aluminium foil. Many of the restaurants have started to use this after the recent plastic ban enforced by the govt. 

It is safe and similar to using a foil container or foil sheet to wrap the food. 

If restaurants go for other modes of packaging then it sometimes end up costing more than the food price itself.

Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani (Recipe in comments),130,bg3cf6,https://i.redd.it/b3vlo0mg2ut21.jpg,17,1555975370.0,,KtmInd,Food," PSA: this is not Hyderabadi Biryani.

Source: am true Blue Hyderabadi. For what it‚Äôs worth, this recipe is not the quintessential Hyderabadi biryani. This is layering mostly cooked rice and chicken, which is closer to the Awadhi dum biryani, and not Hyderabadi Kacchi gosht biryani, where both the meat and rice are practically raw. To tenderise the meat and speed up cooking of the meat, it is marinated in raw papaya. The rice cooks in the meat juices, leading to a flavourful rice. If this is basmati rice, it looks over cooked.

That said, many people in Hyderabad cook dum biryani at home, simply because it is a lot faster than the traditional method. Pulav ko biryani bolta hai bc Your rice is overcooked. Looks good. But, next time, I highly recommend you try this one - https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/hyderabadi-biryani-recipe/

One hotel was giving free chicken lolipops (2 pieces) with every order above Rs. 99. I ordered a lunch meal from them (Rs. 100+). When the order arrived, the chicken lolipops was missing. So I chatted with Swiggy CS and they said they would immediately deliver the ""missing"" item. 

I finished eating and found the lunch to be horrible - everything was either too watery or too oily. I left a 1 star review and gave specific feedback on what was wrong with the food.

Shortly after that Swiggy delivery guy calls me from hotel and says sorry sir, chicken lollipops is not available, can I bring something else. I agree and ask for alternatives. He said some other dish, and I said ok and then he adds - sir you'll have to pay Rs. 50 extra. 

I blasted him politely and told him the item is supposed to be free. He said hotel says that no other suitable alternative is available and the alternative is to ""cancel"" the order. I didn't bother arguing with the poor delivery guy. 

Ofcourse, I am not going to renew my membership.

Uber Eats: 

- Placed an order with McDonalds.
- Order is accepted by McD.
- After 45 minutes Uber guy calls and apologises that McD cannot process the order.
- All good restaurants are closed by then and I had to make chapathis and eggs at midnight. Both Swiggy and Zomato sucks. Same goes to other restaurant research websites operating in india My experience with Swiggy has been great. For reference, I live in Hyderabad. They have a great selection of restaurants (much better than Zomato and Uber eats). Their customer service is awesome, if they deliver an incorrect order they either refund your money or send the correct order plus they always have great offers. 

IMO Uber eats is the absolute worst, their offers suck, you can‚Äôt combine two coupon codes, they have the lowest number of restaurants, their app is not user-friendly, like you can‚Äôt modify your order easily, you can‚Äôt cancel without talking to an executive first, etc. and they don‚Äôt refund money to your bank account even if you pay through your bank account, they give you Uber credits.

Kitne rishte aye? :P I gave mains this time (first attempt) but couldn't make it. Probably should pass prelims again though. How confident were you after mains that you'd make it, cause unlike prelims the feedback for mains is awful. I have no way of gauging whether my essay (as an example) is of the sort that wold fetch me marks or not. I mean I'll have to wait for a week now to get the marks I scored in mains and then try and address my shortcomings. Test series probably aren't close to the real scoring pattern so it's kinda hard to improve there. How's your neighbours son's situation now?  Maybe my questions are noob. Sorry about that. I'm going to start preparing soon.

1) I read in your earlier post, that you didn't go for coaching. Why did you take that decision? And how were you aware of the subject material/books required? 

2) I suck at reading newspapers. I try to read it everyday but tend to read useless topics more. How should I approach? 

3) I guess you said that you didn't want you say your optional subject. Why?

4) Lastly, any good sources for current affairs?? 

And yeah congrats once again :D What job (or which field, if you're paranoid about your identity) were you doing before preparing for UPSC? Was there any safety net you could latch onto in case you didn't succeed? What's the dowry rate now? Preparation strategy-

* How did you endure long and boring study hours? 

* Any memorization tips that you would share with us?

* My reading habits have really regressed in the last 8 years or so. From finishing a novel a week, now I can hardly read a chapter without throwing the book away. As a result, preparing for such high-intensity competitive exams can be difficult as hell. Any advice for us? A big thank you for doing this AMA. First I want to congratulate you for your success! Now my questions:

1) How were you able to get distance yourself from distractions such as social media, gaming etc and focus on studying? What is your advice as for someone who is a little  addicted to gaming & reddit.

2) Any advice for improving English?

3) Can you recommend me any websites or magazines that is good for current affairs and gk?

4) What was your strategy to memorise all this huge gk and current affairs?

5) How many hours did you allot for studies? Do you recommend studying late night?

&#x200B;",atishi_aap,AMA," I'm a professional working in Gurgaon. How can I help AAP, particularly in Haryana elections? 
In past, I had tried to work with AAP, but was unsuccessful at it because of lack of structure. We would love to have you India's HRD Minister. If AAP pushes your name as HRD minister - you might actually get support from other parties and wider constituents. Best of luck for Lok Sabha elections. Hi! Thank you so much for doing this AMA. My questions are more tied to your education work.

1. How do you feel about the role of organisations like Teach For India that exist outside of the public education system but seek to supplement it? There's an argument that they help fill in certain gaps and improve individual schools/aid in teacher improvement, but there's also the counter argument that they devalue actual teachers, so any thoughts would be great!

2. A lot of the changes that have happened in Delhi seem to have involved adopting best practices from other countries and from the existing body of education research. How difficult has it been adapting what works outside the country to what works within the state?

3. There aren't too many centres focusing on education research in India outside of APU, JNU, and TISS (off the top of my head). How problematic is that to localising education research? 

4. Current books you're reading that you'd recommend?

Cheers! Hi Atishi, welcome to Reddit

1. A recent survey showed that 65% of government schools in Delhi are without principals. While the government says the matter is with the LG, how do we make sure children and their studies are not impacted?

2. Delhi is a city notorious for its women safety issues. There are still a lot of boys-only and girls-only government schools in the city. What are your thoughts on such schools? Do you think the government can do more in enabling better, healthy relationship between both genders from a young age? Apologies first up, coz got too many queries

1. Do you think there is a concerted effort to rewrite the history of our country? Do you think that the present uni dimensional nature of professional education is much to blame for the social dystopia whatsapp forwards have created by citing fake history, fake polity and even well educated people are falling prey to it?

2. Do you think that the present governments stance of pushing privatisation of education, and pushing every institution to be self dependent will ultimately spell disaster for the middle class and lower class, who will fail to take up such courses?

3. The Indian growth has been a curious case of jobless growth. What opinion do you have on the fact that although the private sector has boomed since 1991, we have failed to create sufficient jobs? In the same context, should the government be relieved of all responsibility regarding job creation, or do you believe the present govt just wants to shrug off its share of responsibility ?

4. An economy without planning is more often a directionless economy. While NITI aayog was developed in the first place to allow pvt participation in govt decisions, it has now turned out to be a body of paid ""yes men"" who merely provide rubber stamp on what the govt believes. What's your take on this, what do you think is better, the Planning commission or the present model of niti?

Kudos for all your good work. Will wait for a reply! Dear Atishi,

I write to you as a frustrated citizen today and not to discuss AAP's work in Delhi or AAP's plans. I know this is an AMA, but I write this with the hope that you and your party workers will read this, and respond if I am lucky.

This nation seems to be falling apart each day with a new low in operating as a democracy: posts against netas gets you jailed, mobs can kill you and not face legal repercussion, and laws seem to be making dirty politics even more powerful and easier to crush dissent. As recent as today morning multiple law agencies were given the full freedom to track anybody on the internet and take action without specifying a reason.

History has proved that duopoly of Congress & BJP netas wouldn't care for anything but to further their respective position and agenda. Both parties can be considered guilty of introducing measures to further weaken democracy. Not just that, they have succeeded through their legions of ""IT Cell"" trolls to turn people against themselves, actively attacking anti-ruling party sentiment and rooting for measures which are more fascist than democratic in nature.

When AAP rose from the national fire around the Jan Lokpal bill and the protests, I as well as many of us had high hopes from you. But it seems that AAP is, to be honest, in a weaker position to combat this neta duopoly ruling over the nation. Call it ""a conspiracy against Mr Kejriwal by parties"", national opinion is still keeping you guys on the backburner.

Having said that, I think you guys are still fighting the good fight. Delhi's progress in the education system is phenomenal and electricity pricing, as well as the e-delivery of services are huge steps forward. Your struggle with the former Lt. Governor as well as regarding Delhi Police - I can understand why you took them head on. 

Elections are just around the corner. I am someone who is genuinely afraid that our nation, which should be all guns blazing towards progress, will fall into the dark ages with the political game getting nastier by the day. You guys are relatively much better than most national and regional parties in terms of being scot-free. If anything, AAP must concert their efforts like there's no tomorrow and ensure that voter sentiments shift away from the two horrible choices that Indian voters are stuck with.

I, and hopefully quite some of us, are still counting on you and your party. Please give us an option we can choose for once. We need one. Badly now than ever. How can the unemployed people on reddit help your party? You should also teach people that getting water upto 20kL for free and electricity upto 400 units at half rate isn't known as freebie.

Why did you decide to take up social work after spending your entire life working in the corporate sector? What flipped the switch?
2. Of all the social causes you could have taken up, why HIV prevention among sex workers?
3. Considering how taboo sex is in Indian culture, how were the reactions of your family and friends when you decided to work with sex workers? Hi. Congratulations on the success of Avahan!

My question is - 
Most of the problems plaguing the country at this point, be it education/public health/climate are systemic in nature. Successfully solving these problems, that too with a consulting toolkit can be a very hard task. For those of us who‚Äôre young, inexperienced and want to carry out such projects without deep knowledge of how tangled they are, what suggestions would you offer? 

Also, other than HIV, what according to you is the other big problems that we all should be working toward? Signing off for now!
Thanks for all those questions, and I'm on twitter at alexander_ashok.
If you have more questions ...well read the book :)

Bye Here is a recent [article](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/13/the-untold-story-of-how-india-sex-workers-prevented-an-aids-epidemic-ashok-alexander-a-stranger-truth) in the Guardian about the journey what leadership havr you seen come up due to your efforts? My book is not so much about HIV and many of the  questions are ‚Ä¶
Its about the power of communities of the most marginalized women to solve huge problems..there's a revolution hidden in that

Its also about a personal journey, the adventure within us, waiting to be had...

its about another India, shocking and also inspiring we never see..

i'd welcome questions on those lines too... I‚Äôve heard from my friends who‚Äôre at MBBs that it‚Äôs not a cakewalk, you must have worked really hard to be there in the first place and to survive and grow as well. How challenging is it for a person like you to run an NGO like The Antara Foundation and work at the grassroots level in a sector like healthcare? What were the difficulties faced and what was/is the motivation to keep going? Hi Ashok, /u/struggle_r asked the following questions -- 

> Hi Ashok! First of all, a big Thank You. People like you who tirelessly work towards betterment of downtrodden and society at large are the real (unsung) heroes.
>     
> 1. What are your thoughts around BMGF hiring consulting cos for ""projects""?
>     
> 2. If you were given an opportunity to address one problem in Indian society, what would that be? Despite progress and change in social attitudes towards HIV/AIDS, there is yet a lot of stigma that surrounds this health issue. Based on your Avahan experience, what solution would you offer to break this taboo?  What's your view on the recent Trafficking Bill being introduced? Is there any truth in reports claiming that it might end up [targeting sex workers?](https://qz.com/india/1499242/indias-proposed-anti-trafficking-law-may-hurt-sex-workers/) Hi, thanks for taking out the time for doing this.

How would you rate the current situation that we as a country (and the healthcare sector) are at when it comes to tackling the societal aspect of the disease and the taboos associated with it? I believe there is a tremendous amount of work that PSM (preventive and social medicine) can do to make things even better especially when it comes to reaching out to the sex workers and providing them with better support.

Also are there any CSR projects that are looking into this?", redweddingsareawesom derptan ashokchoki2019 ashokchoki2019 yuckfest ashokchoki2019 Central-Midfielder None gsood23 imnotmclovin doc_two_thirty

\-- Milan",milan_vaishnav,AMA," Hi Milan, thanks so much for When Crime Pays! It inspired us to make [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN0iyfob8-U) on our YouTube Channel.

A key aspect of removing crime from politics could be campaign funding reform. How do you think we can realistically  achieve a more transparent campaign finance laws? Would it be fair to say that the present day India is same as the Gilded Age America? Do you think the Indian institutions (RBI, CAG, CVC, CBI, etc) are heavily influenced by political agents? If yes, what can be done to limit the political influence in administrative institutions?  Hi Milan, What is your opinion on bringing private sector talent in Bureaucracy considering conflict of interest, revolving door policy and nepotism.  Hi, what all books do you recommend as your favourites. About India, contemporary politics, world as well as fiction. I have read few chapters from When Crime Pays and found it really interesting, thank you.  I have another question, if you would indulge me, and I understand this is probably not fit for an online AMA.

Do you agree that the emergence (resurgence?) of militant (and super combative+populist) right wing is a pattern that is being observed throughout the major democracies of the world? I understand that each democracy is unique but is there an underlying commonality between these elections? Is this a new world order? Is this the last wave of populist nationalism before ideas such as egalitarianism become mainstream?  Hi Milan, welcome to /r/India. To what extent do you think,  think tanks affect policy making. In your experience, do bureaucrats stay updated with the latest literature?   Its a fatalistic/question out of desperation: will the system of politics, money laundering for elections, crime in politics... Will this ever change? (Deep down I think I know the answer and its not the happy one) What has the reaction to the book ""When Crime Pays"" been in India? Has anything changed since then? Does crime still pay in Indian politics? Are you able to go to India without risking being jailed or personally injured? Do you vote in Indian elections? What do you think of Jason Brennan's book ""Against Democracy""? Hi Milan, thanks for the AMA!

We‚Äôre seeing a lot of fake news being used in the state election campaigns these days (mainly but not exclusively by the BJP) to influence voters emotionally. Now appealing to emotions is understandable, but what do you think is the role of third-party regulation (if any)? Can the Election Commission impose some sort of penalty on political parties for this? If not, what can be done to curb fake news in campaigning - especially since a lot of what is spoken in smaller rallies in neglected areas doesn‚Äôt make it to the news?

I see a lot of people making up their opinions on whom to vote for based on what one politician said about another which is usually nothing but an absurd claim. Hi Milan, is there an estimate of sentiment for or against the current ruling dispensation from the non organized sector?

[deleted] Wow this dude's suffocatingly narcissistic. Won't answer any questions directly, keeps linking his fuckall long list of books and articles like dude wtf do you think? Had we not gone socialist in 1947 hundred thousands of people would have died without food. What do you think about Australia's socialist policies? Why aren't you in India? Is it that inconvenient?  Nothing grinds my gears like a fuckin non residential Indian telling what people living and dying each day in this country what they must do. Fuck your party. You say in your FAQ that you wish to do away with the current reservation system as the changes that you'll implement at the structural level of the government would make it redundant. How would these changes affect the issue of caste based discrimination?  What is your take on decriminalization and legalization of cannabis and getting it into mainstream economy?  [deleted] Indian people, who trade their votes for 500 rs. What's your opinion about them.? Do you think, for their own good, democracy is best option for them? What is the one low hanging fruit for policy change that India should do according to you? Basically, something very easy to achieve except there has not been political will yet.  You seem to conflate socialism with state ownership of means of production. What are your thoughts on anti-statist branches of socialism like [council communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_communism) and various forms of [anarchism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism)? How do you plan on improving the law and order situation in India - specifically rapes and lynchings?
On the same note, since you've talked about abolishing the IAS system as you think it is a breeding ground for corruption, what are your views regarding our incredibly corrupt police system? Several questions:

* By liberalism, do you mean to implement classical liberalism by definition, e.g. a very limited state with rest of the work left to the citizens. Or do you mean a welfare state, with medium to high taxes, basic welfare cover to the citizens and government financing some services like education health etc but a free market at its core. If its the former, and since the Nordic Model has worked quite well, how do you plan to convince people that your idea is better, especially when India has still millions to lift from poverty. 

* Where do you stand on public healthcare (I went over the document and couldn't find much mention of it). Even the most free market economies like Singapore, Korea (South) have some amount of healthcare funded by government public funds. Do you support that?

* Totally free market economy haven't been yet implemented in countries with scale of India (even if we take China, they rarely support free trade, so I don't think they can be called 100% free market). The most liberal economies are small or city states - Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea (south) and the Scandinavian countries. How do you think you will implement free market reforms in billion strong India scale?

* Do you support de-federalization of government functions, a new mostly conservative idea, i.e., most of the government should be implemented at lower levels (panchayat, municipality, district, state etc) and the federal government should be left with only a few functions - national security, external affairs etc. 

* I see you support free speech and free press, how do you plan to deal with fake news which even big media houses have fallen prey to. Should there be any repercussion/legal action if a media house spreads fake news?

* Lastly, I see you support secularism. Do you think secularism and freedom of religion can go together? Should citizens be allowed to mock/criticize religion(s) without any limits, since that falls in your definition of free speech. How do you plan to deal with such speech causing riots?

how is your service better/different from thomas cook/SOTC/Balmer&Laurie ? How many times were you close to bankruptcy? When you are bootstrapped how do you decide salary for founders? Saw your website and really liked the interface. tried planning a Euro trip and my questions are based on that relative experience:

1. Am I right in saying that your website does not sell pre -packaged travel packages rather it gives the user an option to select from within the pre-selected vendor options to ""customise"" their tour? So essentially you are a marketplace of vendors with a travel layer on top to facilitate bookings?
2. Your website helps customise an itinerary but optimising the itinerary is still missing anything you are doing to fix that?
3. I tried creating an account but your website seems content to let me plan without creating an account which is good but created an itinerary and wanted to save it by logging in and couldn't do that?
4. If i directly get in touch with your travel experts to help me create an itinerary will they charge me for that..sorry didn't find that info anywhere? 1. What was your toughest customer service experience?


2. What about backpacking options when visiting a country? For example, exploring areas that are not touristy or somewhat secluded.


3. What are your views on legalizing marijuana in India? Would it change tourism sector in any way and would it change your list of offerings?

4. Let's say a tourist is caught for some illegal activity or a tourist loses their passport. How do you handle such unforeseen circumstances? I am very impressed with the website so I decided to see how it works and looked for Newzeland as an option. And next day onwards I am being called by your representative. I received already 3 calls 1 sms and 1 email.  Hello,
As someone who has used this service, I have had a mixed experience. It's a really nice concept to choose the activities and opt out of the things which doesn't seem to interest the individual.
We have had hiccups during the trip planning and the trip. These could have been better - especially the communication with the overseas partners as well as the visa agents and the ones from PYT who was managing our trip (this was resolved after escalations and the agent was changed) 

Also someone was supposed to get back to me regarding an issue but then forgot to, as this was post the vacation. I would have had a better opinion if the person followed through on this than leaving it.

Anyways, my first international vacation was through you guys and I will always remember the good and the bad.

AMA is over guys. Thank you.",root_su,AMA," I don't know if I am the only one, but I have been seeing a lot of India hate on this very subreddit which was made for us. No country is perfect, but whenever some negative stuff pops here, all I see is people (NRIs?) urging others to leave this shithole. This breeds a lot of negativity in the minds of the many people of impressionable age who come here for a reasonable discussion. 

Any thoughts on that?

Edit : added a word Is it possible to implement something to weed out duplicate articles from the same sources?

Sometimes I see the same link spammed by different users with varying amount of karma in a row. I was really going to post about why mods don't comment on posts lmao. What you guys generally do apart from Reddit ? How many of you became mods through management quota?

/s Look, I don't want to be the tin-foil hat guy, but the X user got banned threads on /r/bakchodi , /r/indianews  etc. Many of them are backing those threads with quite a bit of evidence of the mods being very heavy handed and extremely biased towards those kinda leaning towards BJP side I guess (left / right. Not sure which side BJP is TBH. I do not identify BJP or congress to either)...

Either ways, whats your side of the story ? What's something that you want us as the general public to do so other Indians can also start using reddit? 
Afaik barely a decent amount of Indians use it, isliye putcha Do you guys think r/india is a balanced forum for political topics?  How can a user of this sub, become a mod of this sub? Hi Mods,

Being a long time member of Randia, why my posts are being auto removed even after posting with flair?

I had sent you multiple pm for each of the removed posts.
I got a reply from you saying ""New/low karma accounts face reasonable restrictions.""

But mine is not a new account nor a low karma account.
Even my first gold was on Randia folks.

So please let me know why this keeps on happening ?
Edit: spelling can we have a ""when you visit"" thread here?

Its not very often but at times people pop in to ask if some place is good to visit or not, and it gets lost.

How much time did it take to do the Jay Amit Shah story? Give us a glimpse of what went behind the scenes. Not a question but a suggestion.

P.S : Great job. Love your site! 1. From where does thewire get its news, Do you have reporters spread all over the country? How do you get news from different parts of India?

2. How about a show in which you visit various parts of the country and talk to people just like Ravish Kumar used to do in his old shows? With four senior most judges of the honorable Supreme Court coming out in open I genuinely worry about the present situation in India. An ocean of illogical, irrational people makes me hopeless of the future.

Is there really no hope? The wire has been commended for its integrity at a time conventional media houses are seemingly losing theirs. It must be very satisfying to work at an organisation staying true to journalistic principles. Is the trade off in alienating powerful figures (for instance, the Jay Shah defamation case) worth it?

Also, I believe the wire does not have advertisements and survives off donations. Is it difficult to manage finances? What options do you have in case of a cash crunch?

Edit:

Thanks for your queries r/india. It was a pleasure interacting with guys. Glad to see many tech enthusiasts in here.

Hope to see you in a new AMA with our new processor. 

We are signing off. Thanks again!!",shaktiteam,AMA," Hi, I'm excited to see you taking an AMA. I heard about your recent tapeout of Shakti cores. The second public tapeout of risc-v in the world. Congratulations!

I have a few questions:

1) I understand the stages of software design, but hardware is opaque. Can you give us a overview of the stages of processor design? What stages cost the most time? Which ones take the most manpower? 

1A) I remember reading that AMD Zen team spent 2 million man hours over 4 years to design the replacement to Excavator. Since I don't understand much about hardware, how can a small group of entrepreneurs and academics hope to put up the enormous amount of effort needed to build and validate a processor design?

2) Can you elaborate on your power, performance, area and especially security design goals for your server and desktop class processors? I've read your website but it only mentions features and clockrate of the processors. Compared to the best Intel server and desktop chips of 2018, what is your performance goal? 50% as good? 80%?

2A) I'm not asking you to commit to delivering chips on any time frame, but once again, due to my ignorance of hardware, I don't have any idea of how long your chip design efforts will take. To meet your design goals for servers and desktop as detailed in 2), how long do you estimate it will take your team to design these chips? 5 years? 10 years?

3) I'm given to understand that the x86 processor family was not designed for security. The processor design grew organically over time, so it's as full of holes as Swiss cheese. What systematic hardware and software design changes, if any, are you taking to avoid the security failures of x86, ARM and MIPS family?

4) I'm concerned about the security of RISC-V chips. The chip design world is spending a lot of time and money to formally verify the risc-v ISA and creating chip designs, but they're writing drivers and other hardware level software in C or C++, which has had almost 50 years to prove itself insecure. I understand that you will need to write code in C for Linux related matters, and I don't expect that to change. However, have you considered using more secure languages like Rust for software that does not have to be in C/C++? 

I'm pointing this out because whatever language you use for your risc-v project is going to be in use 50 years from now. I really don't want to be using insecure software in 2068. Have you given any thought to this? You have stated on your bitbucket-site that there will be six (or eight) versions of cores, I have seen progress on three of those. What is the timeline for the rest of the processors? 
 Another question: Have you guys considered a copyleft license for your project like Cern Open Hardware License? 

BSD-style licenses allow for one-way transfer of intellectual property, whereas copyleft licenses like COHL keep the pool of intellectual property in the public domain. 

Using a permissive license like BSD will make it very easy for companies to take your design and make it proprietary, but its not the right license if you want to create a open hardware ecosystem. 

Why would a company like Samsung take your design and put 250 million dollars of investment to take it to the next level of quality, if the BSD license allows Apple to show up, take the results of Samsung's hard work and make it proprietary? 

BSD and Linux projects have been around for the same length of time, but while Linux has taken over the world, BSD is stagnant. Companies don't use permissive licenses for software unless they control that stack and it's not a core part of their business. Permissive licences create silos but an open hardware community needs a two-way, copyleft license. 

Due to the incentives your license creates, I expect companies and academics to take your work but not give anything back. An open hardware community based on your team's work is all but impossible. Have you considered changing the Shakti project's license? Hey there!

First off, great job and congratulations! 

What advice would you give to a 2nd year student who loves processors and wants to learn how to build them? Where would you have me start with this and what resources (books, software, etc.) are available? 


Thanks in advance!  Amazing work. Have few queries
1. Any plans to develop custom unix based OS for the processor? 
2. Any Plans to make integrated GPGPU system with industry? what is the process involved in testing these chips? Hi /u/shaktiteam, welcome to /r/India. Here are some of the questions that were posted on the announcement thread:

From /u/nascentmind

> Will you be selling cheap development boards for the community to contribute? I am eager to get my hands on it and would like to contribute.

From /u/broine

> Hi, thank you for the AMA.

> Since you mentioned ""interconnect fabrics"", and I am speculating from the POV of high performance computing...what are the prospects of RISC based systems for taking over the next generation of hardware?

From /u/mynameissomethingtoo

> Congratulations to you guys.

> This is unrelated, but would you like to comment on the Spectre and Meldown vulnerabilities recently detected in Intel chips? Can you guys dumb down what exactly had happened and why was everyone freaking out?

From /u/Modi-iboM

> Questions, because I will surely miss the time slot:-

> 1) Any timeline of when we will see these processors on a motherboard?

>2) Can we see DMESG output?

>3) When should we expect Indian supercomputer with these chips running? Will Intel withhold their facilities when they come to know that these chips will be used for supercomputing purpose? Can Taiwanese fabs be roped in at that time?

From /u/dylan522p

> Why are you using Intel 22nm FFL over a more standard Fab for a first tapeout/model, such as TSMC 28nm?

From /u/innovator116


> I am emphasizing here as I have said globally, that RISV-V will need small scale semiconductor fabs model to become ubiquitous. When small groups will not just be able to implement RISV-V based microprocessors but manufacture them as well locally.

> My question is, has the IIT-M team has reached out to IISc groups working on nanopatterning lithography technologies? A national consortium to design, develop and manufacture ICs domestically is need of the hour.

> Proprietary hardware is bound to contain backdoors for Americans or Chinese.

From /u/up-sky-7

> Do you plan on releasing everything as FOSS (100% Libre), even the GPU?

From /u/kipboye

> Hey there!

> First off, great job and congratulations!

> What advice would you give to a 2nd year student who loves processors and wants to learn how to build them? Where would you have me start with this and what resources (books, software, etc.) are available?

> Thanks in advance!

From /u/pcein

> Great to see the amazing work you are doing, and thanks for the AMA! A few questions:

   > Can a hobbyist like me try out the SHAKTI processor on an FPGA dev board (like the Zedboard)?
    You mentioned a ""Rust based OS"" for supporting tagged ISA's in a recent HN post. Are any details regarding this available?
    At the moment, SHAKTI seems like a mostly IITM-only project - any plans on getting the FOSS community involved in it to a greater extend?



 Hi Paul, ssup, so prod to see this day, never thought I would see a batch,ate of mine doing an AMA on randia :')

So how long before this will be ready for applications in real world? 

 Right now I think the manufacturing is done in the us, are there any plans for manufacturing in india?  Is only GCC and Glibc ported as well?  I always thought RISC processors were more suited for low-power/embedded applications. TIL you can also put them in HPCs.  

1. If I had the hardware, what is the fastest way to compile simple c code ? What tools do I need?  

2. I'm bit rusty on systems knowledge, but writing LLVM backend for RISC must be more difficult than, say x86? Because adapting generated IR would be exposed to more instructions?  

3. Are there any plans to make a GPGPU using risc-v ? 
4. Are you guys hiring? For what positions?", 777cleveindians Plozzo 777cleveindians kipboye sargasticgujju None None pm_me_your_hurt frostydrizzle prateek Kaka_chale_vanka

Greetings [/r/India](https://www.reddit.com/r/India)!

Tomorrow, August 24, marks the first anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision on the Right to Privacy judgement. This marked an important point for the conversation around what it means to be free. To love, to share and to learn. Privacy makes a lot of this possible. An essential part of a privacy right is to ensure India gets a law that protects people from the harmful use of digital technologies that profile and surveil them. One of the efforts to make sure this legal reform takes place is the SaveOurPrivacy campaign which has proposed a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 that is open for feedback and comment. Some of the lawyers and policy experts will join the Reddit community today between 6:30 - 7:30 IST to chat on not only this campaign but reflect in the broader privacy issues including the social media communication hub, mass CCTV deployment, Cambridge Analytica.

If you have privacy badger installed on your browser, show up. If you use duckduckgo, show up. If you didn't link your Aadhaar to anything, show up. If you worry about strong encryption preventing law enforcement agencies from doing their work, show up!

Collectively, we are the #SaveOurPrivacy drafting volunteers. Our twitter handles are below.

&#x200B;",SaveOurPrivacy,AMA," Hi! Thank you for your awesome work, and of course, the AMA. We have a few questions
which probably stem from a limited understanding of law in general, and this proposed
bill in particular. 

## Definitions:

1. Would you consider location data, call records, and behavioral data, as 
constituents of personal data? Are these covered under the proposed bill, or are
these to be treated separately?

2. Clause 2.1.b Is psedonymised data a permissible alternative for businesses to
claim that they have suitably anonymised the data?

3. Does the 2.1.h definition of _communication_ encompass keystrokes, screenshots
and other electronic signals that may enable creation of PII? Will back-channel
attacks to steal encryption keys be construed unlawful under the provision of this
bill?

4. The GDPR definition of personal data [includes](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-personal-data_en):
      > Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the 
      > identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data.  
      
   Does the definition in 2.1.u personal data incorporate this aspect?


## Scope:

1. How does the bill treat personal data of minors under 13? This is a lucrative
user base for certain industries, and we have seen quite a few data breaches 
involving children's data.

2. How will the current Lawful Intercept regime be impacted by such a bill? Will
this lead towards the creation of special, FISA-like courts, with unfettered powers?

3. Suppose civic volunteers create a database in the form of a spreadsheet to help 
distressed individuals during a natural calamity which they then forget to dispose off.
Will the proposed Privacy Commission act suo motu, to ensure safe disposal of such zombie data? 

4. The current interpretation of [public order](https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/free-speech-and-public-order-1)
requires relevance, and mandates proportionate action, for greater good. However, we see 
the phrase ""public order"" has become [increasingly popular](https://imgur.com/a/6ta3xt9) in recent case records. Do you
foresee abuse of this provision in near future?

5. While _ex post facto_ laws are notoriously difficult, Article 20 does not particularly
forbid such a law (Sujjan Singh v. State of Punjab). Do you see a parallel in businesses
which continue to profit from data collected at an earlier era and the corruption case?

## Business Impact:

1. Do you see the need for a transition period to allow businesses to incorporate
the recommendations, and streamlining the proposed Privacy Commission's processes?

2. Per the provision of 5.1.3 an Airbnb host can install CCTV cameras which become
a nightmare for a guest at a later time. How do you propose the bill deal with such
cases?

3. Suppose the medical history of a comatose patient, suffering from a rare disease,
is of interest to researchers. Is it then the next-of-kin's decision whether or not
to share the data? 8.3 discusses unsound mind, but not unsound health.

4. Will such a bill thwart IP that hinges on sensitive data? See the recently filed
[Google patent](https://twitter.com/PrivacyMatters/status/1032183690447806464).

5. Do employers need informed consent before installing packet inspection software
on devices provided to employees that are used off-premises? Also, how would you
treat this [recent](https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1032543799258431488) case.

Edit: Added graph on ""public order"" phrase frequency, 2008-2017; grammar





   

Thank you for doing this AMA for a community such as ours at r/india. You folks at the Internet Freedom Foundation have been doing some stellar work and it motivates me every day to do better for the society we live in. I have a few questions for all of you and I hope you can answer some if not all:

1. What is your opinion on the recent case filed in Delhi High Court seeking damages from the UIDAI for the leak?

2. Banks still insist on me submitting my Aadhar to open an account. Apart from not opening an account there what redressal so I have?

3.Why do you think Google recently preinstalled the helpline number of UIDAI on all our cellphones?

4. When does the grapevine expect the Aadhar judgment to be pronounced by the SC?

5. Has there been a large data leak in India that the general public is not aware of?

6. The appointments made to the Justice Srikrishna Committee on Data Privacy were said to be completely one sided favoring the corporates and datamarketeers. What do you feel we can do to make our voice more heard?

7. Do you think sophisticated data theft by Indian corporates will become more easy in the coming years due to the onslaught of AI? It may be difficult for consumers such as I to get access to such a sophisticated software to stop them.

8. Can we create an anonymous crowd sourced Privacy App (ACPA) to show us which developers sell our data and to what extent?

9. Mumbai currently has CCTV cameras with facial recognition present everywhere. How are they protecting my data under the archaic IT Act? What are they doing with my data? Who has access to the footage and how can I secure it?

10. Does Justice Srikrishna's new Data Protection Bill have a clause for whistle blowers or ethical hackers such as Edward Snowden or will someone who does something similar be left for the dogs? Heya! You guys are doing something really really important, please keep doing the good work and thank you.

My question is most people don't take privacy seriously, they just hand over any document they are asked for without even a single thought and this becomes even more worrisome in case of aadhar. I personally get in a agrument on weekly basis with people around me just for this.

How does one explain to them that this is dangerous and they shouldn't share anything with anyone just 'cause someone asks for it and especially not their aadhar number, what is the most logical and simplest agrument against not Sharing your information according to you.

And again Thank You, really we the citizens are indebted to your fight and cause. Hey Gautam Sir! Following you since your gold record days at Bangalore!... Big fan of yours. 
***
* Wish to know that how advisable is it to lock biometric details on the Aadhar website? 

* Also what is the case where non-government agencies ask for Aadhar details? Like banks or when couriers ask it for verification? Not giving them amounts to non-accessation of services so what's the alternative?

* Any provision for me to delete my aadhar details from the system or is it like lifetime liability which the govt. has handed us?

* Why is there no option on the UIDAI website to change the mobile number details?

* Why is google.com tracking me on every other website? Like reddit, facebook? How to shoo it away, although blocking it using the privacy badger makes sites non-functional at times.

* What is your advice you would like to give to your 20 year selves?

* What precautions do you take regd. online mass surveillance which happens. How to fight it?



Edit: For Apar; How have you automated deletion of your tweets after a month and why? What are your views on data localisation, both with respect to the Indian Privacy Code, as well as the Justice Srikrishna Committee report?  Thanks for AMA, Here are my questions:

1. Your bill defines personal data only to the extension of personal identification but what about the situations when a sample size is taken and it leads to identification but not the personal identification example google adds some are based on your data (shopping, browsing) and some are based on demographics (what indian people like, obsession with foreign brands). How we will be address that? 

2. As we already know, most of developing democracies have data protection law and authorities (though needs to be strengthen) but that don‚Äôt stop corporations from misusing it then how we will we able to stop them considering almost all the tech based are foreign funded and have big pockets. 

3. As in this internet age, if you are consuming something for free, then you yourself are the product ‚Äì considering this, don‚Äôt you think convenience will always overshadow privacy barring few enlighten and rich souls?  

4. As all this EULA‚Äôs, T&C are lengthy legal jargon and people just accepts them ‚Äì where the real privacy stays and how explicit consent is derived in these situations as this is almost like you have to accept it otherwise there is no alternative (even the law like EU‚Äôs GDPR is not able to simplify it)

5. Considering that the world is on the brink of fourth Industrial revolution and it will be fuelled by data, can we expect that in the upcoming time certain portion of personal data will defacto remain in public domain (name, DoB, banks account number, address etc) just like older days though now only certain clicks away. 

6. What about sting operations and mobile devices sending data for analytical purposes? 

7. Why can‚Äôt ne Aadhar number can be seen as indian replacement for Social Security number to avail basic services like phone number, bank accounts etc?

8. What tools do you guys use for privacy protection? Which phone, phone OS, laptop, laptop OS, internet browser and addons? 

9. Why not Constitutional status for Privacy commission in your bill, considering it is going to be new norm in upcoming time just like election and election commission?

10. No specific clause for Right to be forgotten in you bill which hits to the core of internet as they say you can't really delete once something is on internet?

 Not a relevant comment on an AMA, but can someone do a tldr or explain in layman terms what the judgement is about? What is the stand of IFF regarding CryptoCurrency usage in India?  What are your thoughts on Aadhar? Tysm for doing this AMA..

Many queries regarding current scenario, here are just a few

\->is the idea of ""finding the source of fake news"" feasible? It is like ""cut one head and 2 more shall take its place"" ...  how many will the govt. book!! too much too bring under control, shouldn't there be some other way?

\->has the govt. or civil soc. made any plans on how to curb this menace in the coming election year? I bet Whatsapp will be massively used for propagation and hoaxes.

\->the current idea of making internet giants place a server in India to curb fake news.. OK no problem.. what if govt uses this to curb dissenting, criticising voices. what are the checks and balances in that case?

\->why can't whatsapp have option of marking a ""particular msg"" as ""spam"". More the number of reports it gets on a particular msg, it can analyse and block its forwarding?

\->why cant user be asked for permission before he is added to any group?

1. How much does it cost in total to produce one podcast? 
2. Can a crowdfunding campaign be started for that? I am ready to contribute. I think we can easily find another 500-1000 through social media who would want to join in. 

3. Who do you think is the most underrated comic from India at present?
4. AIB or TVF?

No questions. Just wanted to say that your Youtube channel is like an island of sanity in the digital sea of misinformation. It really separates truth from fiction for a lot of people.  

I suggest you to PLEASE make a video on [legalization of foreign funding retrospectively from 1976](https://twitter.com/Memeghnad/status/973815913014267904), and the mechanisms used by the BJP for passing it. The word needs to get out to more people.  
Best of luck! Do you talk about religious superstitions, homeopathy and general pseudoscience? We need more people who'll promote science in these times where pseudoscience is taking the front seat. If you don't tackle these type of issues, do you wish to do so in the future? when you make youtube video's do you think you are reaching an audience that is different from maybe those who hear soundcloud or read blogs? Just wanted to say one of my bhakt friends from Maheshwari community has become more rational ever since he started watching your videos. He is more receptive to you because he thinks you are from his caste/community. This may sound silly to a lot of urban and younger randians, but that's the truth for small town India and I think it would be an effective way to reach out to similarly conservative communities across the country.

P.S.: This is a throwaway",intraday_trader,AMA," Bhai, say something basic about where to start. All the full time traders I have seen till date feels like rely on luck. More than half the times their calls fail. 

What strategies do you use as an intraday trader? What patterns/charts/tools do you people use? 

I relatively have learnt about how stoploss becomes an important factor. That 1 big profitable trade can beat 10 small triggered stoplosses.
But I have difficulty in selecting stocks for derivatives intraday. And also predicting the pattern.

Edit: have burnt around 50k in options last year in 2 months. That's quite an outstanding performance IMO. Congrats on that.

1. Do you ever indulge in Derivative trading. If Yes, what would you prefer Stock Derivatives, or Index Derivatives ? 

2. Have you ever hedged your positions through options ? Like using a protective put strategy  ?

3. How much do you rely on quantitative analysis, and how much on intuition ? Have you ever performed regression testing or used Quantitative models like EWMA ?

4. What role do you think Fundamentals \(ie. Reported balance sheet figures\) lay on Intraday  trading, and have you ever bet on high volatility events such as Budget Day or Announcing of Quarterly Results ?

5. What parameters do you set while exiting a transaction \(eg. Exit after a max of 5&#37; Profit or 5&#37; Loss\) ?

6.  Which would you place an intraday bet on ? A small cap stock, Midcap stock or a bluechip one ? I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let‚Äôs assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.

Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.

Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over $1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would have been won.

By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably write books on ‚ÄúHow I turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.‚Äù Worse yet, they‚Äôll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors with, ‚ÄúIf it can‚Äôt be done, why are there 215 of us?‚Äù

By then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much the same ‚Äî 215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips. what is your daily/weekly profit target ?

how many trades do you do in a day ?

what exactly do u use in technical tool for entry & exits ?  (like MACD Stoch Oscill 
 or other?) 

What is your daily loss limit ?

do you trade from home ?

how much tax you pay for intra day profits ?

you said volatility is important - what technical indicator you use for it ?

do you track open positions in F&O markets for profit booking and longs unwinding  scenarios ?

Which day of the week has is most volatile for equities ? do you use automated trading based on python ? For how long you have been trading ? my dad told me this is like 'gambling' how accurate is that?
if you hit the jackpot or you loose everything How much spread do you encounter when making obvious bets (like pc jewellers tanking on arrest of Md)  What do you use to back-test your strategies and execute your strategies?  Should I learn coding to be a successful trader? I have a RSI+MACD+AO strategy, that works really good for high leverage intraday. But I am either too drunk, or unfocused to bother constantly looking at the charts. Amateur trader here. First of all, thank you for this ama. 

You mentioned you use price action to trade. How do you use back testing with this? Because the way I use price action is rather 'fluid' and is based on the way I read the market at the moment. If you don't mind, can you give a brief outline of your backtesting methodology? Also, where do you get the data for testing? Thanks.

Bare breast protest against hypersexualising female body: Arathy speaking,297,8624g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8624g8/bare_breast_protest_against_hypersexualising/,259,1521668315.0,"Hello everyone, My name is Arathy SA, from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. Last year I happened to be in the news when me and my partner telecasted live the moral policing we faced from the female police officers in a park here. Now, it seems I have drawn attention back to me when it became news when I posted a bare breast picture in Facebook , protesting against hypersexualising female bodies, especially since the topic of breasts is being talked about like never before in the public discourse of Kerala. Feel free to clear your doubts regarding my move üôÇ

Edit:Thank you all for your enthusiastic participation! I am so sorry I couldn't find the time to answer all your queries. I've been invited for more AMAs, let me see how much I can accommodate.Closing this AMA. Thank you once again for this wonderful opportunity!",ArathySA,AMA," Its all  about context, breasts are hypersexualized because we live in a society which values sex so much. Go to any tribal village and you'll see that no one is uncomfortable with being naked because its their lifestyle and they don't hype sex like the best thing on earth. No doubts. Just wanted to say Kudos! 

Taboo has no place in a civilised world. Shame is not a natural emotion. Early man/woman didn't need to feel ashamed for being themselves. 

Only when there is healthy interaction between men and women in a society will objectification stop.

Women must occupy public spaces. We all must. We have to normalise the streets of our country to be safe.

Stay safe please! Have any political parties / candidates reacted to this move, either negatively or positively? Any death threats (better be none)? Lastly, has any party came to you personally? Hi Arathy:

1. What specifically are you protesting? What does 'hypersexualising' mean exactly? 

2. Are breasts not a sexual organ, from the perspective of psychology if not reproduction? Good job. Most people aren't this brave to protest against societies tolerance for regressiveness. I saw one pic where someone (you?) was holding two small melons covering the nipples but not the breast completely. 

Don't you think this move is a juxtaposition, of essentially re-sexualizing boobs instead of desexualizing them by bringing attention straight towards the boobs themselves.  Damn, I could not go out bare chested, because of my enlarged nipples poking through my t-shirt. I get ridiculed relentlessly, especially girls. Any respite for me?  Do you think this kind of protest will be accepted as a suitable protest option in the coming times? 

Will be a welcome change from usual hartals. I heard Facebook deleted your's and someone else's account for posting those pics? What reason did they give you for this? Do you think it was justified?

",kumbhakaran,AMA," What do petitioners seek to achieve?

1. A formidable data protection law?
2. Making current Aadhaar Act more robust?
3. Ensuring the implementation of 'voluntary enrolment' section of the act?
4. Doing away with the use of biometric?
5. Dismantling whole Aadhaar infrastructure?
6. Something else?

Edit : This question has been ignored, despite being decently upvoted. Clarifying, that this is not a troll/rhetoric question. The question seeks to understand, what is the way forward. Each one of you can please reply individually. I have had the experience of living in a State where they had a dictatorship. The id card was a weapon used by the state to deny people their rights. If you didn't have an id you did not exist. The State actively denied id to people of certain demographics who they knew were generally against the state. Then there were things like the police were authorised to stop anyone and demand an id, if you were unfortunate not to have one, you were at their mercy.

My question is, how far are we from such a reality?

Secondly going by the Government's arguments in court about owning personal biometrics, is it not possible that the government may in the future decide to include dna as an additional biometric?  Since many of us here have been following and opposing aadhaar from its very beginning , I think we are now at the cusp of its final road where it could go either way.. so my question in general is 

1.) If the judgement does in comes favor of the petitioners , and aadhaar is scarped , or limited , what would be the govt`s reaction ? can they make new pillars through parliament to strengthen it?

2.) If the judgement comes in favor of govt , what should be our next course of action ? I for one and many here and on other forums havent enrolled for aadhaar , so should be our next move , still wait out or enroll after SC judgement?

Thanks in advance for your participation here on reddit . To the lawyers on the panel:

If there is proof that a citizen's Aadhar number is leaked (by govt website or other means); can the citizen disown the Aadhar number like other IDs and names/surnames via the affidavit route? 

i.e. Can I file an affidavit that my Aadhar number so-and-so is leaked and not to be trusted for any further transaction. Put advt in two national papers and be done with it?
 On a recent trip, I witnessed large scale collection of fingerprints in a temple premises for free food - the reason given was to prevent the same person availing the benefit multiple times for each slot. As far as I know, there are no laws in place that makes the fingerprint collection illegal.

If they were collecting raw fingerprint data, and UIDAI somehow had access to that, they could match that with the hashes they have, and illegally build a raw fingerprint database linked to people's identities, which could be misused at scale with horrific consequences.

In all the discussions of Aadhaar related privacy issues I've seen so far, no one has raised the issue of private players collecting fingerprints from masses and selling it to corrupt officials at UIDAI, who could use the Aadhaar database to build a raw biometrics database that could be used to target citizens at will.

Would you please raise this issue as well? Also, could you petition to stop the ongoing fingerprint collection at the temple? Unless I'm mistaken, it happens everyday, and it's quite a popular temple.

Video of incident: https://streamable.com/i8l9t We live in a country of where more than half the population do not have permanent address. Aadhar does not allow us to change addresses easily? So, what shall I do, not move? If my house owner asks me to move shall I quote Aadhar as the reason for not shifting?

We live in a country where connectivity is at the best 50% or less reliable. The service provided by the telecom providers are so bad, that we need to have multiple phone numbers so that we can have a connected when necessity arises. So, what do I do? Should I put up with bad connectivity and bad customer service because I have recorded this phone against my Aadhar? Say, my mobile got stolen, what do I do? Because it is against my Aadhar, I have to go complain, get an FIR and make sure the telecom provider either disables and gives me another SIM with the same phone number? How do I prevent misuse of my phone now? So, basically while in the past I could have just said ""forget it"" it is just a loss of 10K, now I find myself in a position where it is a huge loss, waste of time and effort and making sure I prove that I did not do something wrong? Say I got another phone with a different number, how do I change my phone number? It is a myth that address and phone numbers on Aadhar can be changed. I know of people who are already struggling to do this!!!

We live in a country where more than half the population has to do manual labor to survive, which means finger prints do not get retained over a period of years that is what we are talking about, not just one year and two years!! We are talking over a life time. Over that period of time I get cuts over my finger, I get burns, things get smudged, I have accidents, fingerprints are bound to change. So, what shall I do? Are we suggesting I cannot live a carefree life because I have enrolled in Aadhar? I have to ensure my finger print stays, so another thing I ensure does not happen?

What is the means of identifying a person at all? Address changes, phones change, fingerprints are non-reliable. DNA? So, how do we get a fast recognizing DNA machine? What is the reliable form of identification that can be automated in the real-time that is required here? None of these have been thought about!!! The environmental factors have not been considered to ensure over a period of 40+ years the same identity can be maintained and proved!!! Who has studied fingerprints to ensure nothing changes because of the heat or the dryness of the air, the pollution in the air? Yet, this is being linked to all my life savings, insurances, investments and so on everything that I have been doing to ensure a good retirement?

So, in the end, the way I see Aadhar: There will definitely come a time when I cannot prove my identity since all forms of identification used in Aadhar is not permanent, I would have linked all my life savings to this form of identification hence all my life work has been wasted and what really has happened is a person who had all the hacking skills was able to just breeze in and use my life savings to live a better life and I who tried to make life better got the worst end of it, because my government told me that all my hard work was worth nothing because I could not prove the 12 digit number that I am quoting belongs to me!!! Strange life!!! Thank you so much all for doing this AMA.

I usually have a problem explaining to my friends why Aadhaar is big deal. The general mentality I've encountered is that it doesn't matter and privacy is dead in the modern age anyway. Could you give a plausible negative scenario or two that I could use as an example to explain to them about why we should be concerned. Most people I've talked to don't care about the leaks at all. If I could tell them how exactly it could affect us, that would help raise awareness at whatever level I can.

Thanks again for fighting the system on this and doing what you're doing. You're all very helpful to people like me.  My question is to [/u/jackerhack](https://www.reddit.com/u/jackerhack), [/u/prasanna_s](https://www.reddit.com/u/prasanna_s), [/u/thejeshgn](https://www.reddit.com/u/thejeshgn) and [/u/iam_anandv](https://www.reddit.com/u/iam_anandv):

Many security researchers like [fs0c131y](https://twitter.com/fs0c131y) and [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/is-indias-aadhaar-system-really-hack-proof-assessing-a-publicly-observable-security-posture) have found out several vulnerabilities with the mAdhaar app and the uidai website. In spite of all this, neither the website nor the app has been updated. Why is the organisation so ignorant of these critical issues? I'm a journalism student interested in Aadhaar (full disclosure: most of you know who I am) and there are some pretty basic questions I have that I'll direct at whoever I think is best equipped to answer.

**To Reetika Khera:**

What is *the* largest fundamental failure Aadhaar has resulted in PDS? Without going into privacy concerns, has distribution of entitlements improved in any way at all from the pre-Aadhaar era?

**To Anand V:**

Why is the UIDAI so inept at handling architectural vulnerabilities and security holes? Is it mostly fixable oversight or irreversible negligence? What is, from a tech POV, the largest failure in Aadhaar that you think exists?

**To Chinmayi:**

What are some things the UIDAI can do to bake privacy more deeply into how Aadhaar works? What, in your opinion, are the major flaws in the Aadhaar Act and the major flaws in its implementation?

**To Prasanna:**

What concerns you most about the ongoing Aadhaar hearings, especially with the government's arguments and some misconceptions the justices might have?

**To Kiran:**

What, in your opinion, is the single biggest security flaw with Aadhaar that *can be easily fixed* but is not being fixed with the UIDAI.

**To anyone:**

What would you personally start with as a foundation in your criticism of Aadhaar? I see a lot of really tangential issues being discussed in-depth on Twitter, so how would you describe the core of your objection to Aadhaar as a project?

---

Thank you all for doing this, by the way! [deleted] Thanks for doing this AMA, and for all the work you folks are doing on Aadhar. 

I have a question, probably best directed to /u/prasanna_s but for anyone else who knows the answer, too. 

What exactly is the role that the Vidhi Center for Legal Policy is playing in this case? Are they government-funded or just engaged by the government to deal with this matter?

I am a Paper Modeler (someone who creates MACHINES using just PAPER & GLUE) and I also work with IBM as a CRM Consultant. Luckily, I have been able to balance between both of these. 

https://imgur.com/a/rkRtYJW

I have been making paper models from last 15 years and have handcrafted a lot of them. And the one project that gave me enormous visibility & recognition, is where I created a 6.5 ft long paper model of T-90 tank and I sold the idea to the Indian Army. 

I have shared my story at TEDx & Josh Talks and have been covered by YourStory, Top Gear, The Hindu, etc. It was my lucky day when I displayed all my paper models at ‚ÄòThe Auto Expo‚Äô, that too free of cost and I was also invited to conduct a paper modeling workshop for General Managers (including the CEO) of Taj Group of Hotels in Mumbai.

Ask me ANYTHING!
",PaperModelGuru,AMA," Hi Atamjeet, welcome to /r/India. Did you really sell a T\-90 model or was that a joke? Would love to see a photo of the model if it's not too much hassle. Hi bro. That gun on the wall is awesome :) 
 Atam veer tera kehra batch c? Main v amritsar ton aa. Tera naam suneya lagda Nice! How did you start before 15 years ? youtube didn't exist then so enormously difficult!  

And how does one become better ?  never knew that Indians were interested in paper modeling Hello! :)   

how do you go about designing your models? Esp how do you plan cutouts or intersection of paper joints etc.     
What software are involved?    You get a few of the models from that Canon creative park, right? I also used that site! But only for easier paper models tho. 

Also what kind of paper do you use? plain 80 gsm paper doesn't hold up that much. How to study for exams ? 1) You are putting in which city?
2) Why don‚Äôt you offer your work to Movies ?
3) Is this a Hobby or you are turning this into full time profession?
4) Don‚Äôt you think this thing should go to others, if you can teach this art to others?
5) Do you get papers easily (as strength is the main issue)? Hey thanks for doing this AMA.

How did you learn this craft and at what age.
How do you manage your time between your work and passion.  You said you sold the tank to the Indian army? Can I know for how much? And what was the size of that model? How much time did it take? How many papers?

He called on mental health professionals and others to empower people with the right knowledge so that they make informed decisions. 

Inspired by this, in 2014, White Swan Foundation was founded. This week, we complete 4 years! 

On our portals, we offer content in six languages, have over 600 articles in English alone, and over 100 videos on our YouTube channel. We‚Äôve also reached out to over 2000 people in our outreach programmes with schools, colleges, ASHA workers, etc. You can see some of those pictures [here.](https://imgur.com/a/2dfBO)

Today, there is 20% chance that one of us will develop a mental health issue sometime in our lifetime. The treatment gap for mental health issues is over 85% which means for every 100 people with mental health issues, only 15 get treatment! We believe that the stigma of mental health and illness can be drastically reduced by knowledge and awareness.

We want to curate many more such conversations until going to a mental health professional for a mental health concern is just as easy and natural as going to a doctor for the flu!

Edit: This has been truly amazing! Thank you for all your questions. We are taking a break, for now, and will be back tomorrow, 29th March at 4.30pm once again to answer your questions.

",mentalhealthind,AMA," 1.Is Overthinking about a random thing in a conversation or just about anything, a mental health issue?
2.Is wanting things to be perfect for everything, a mental health issue? For someone who is dealing with mental health issues , I personally feel the need of awareness about this issue. Even educated people have this weird stigma around this area of health. There are millions of Indians who are hiding their issues from their parents, spouses, bf/gf because they fear that they will be judged. 

The number of suicides and various reports vindicate what I am saying. I recently talked with a girl who said how she wasn't getting married just because she had depression and she was open about it.  She was advised by even her doctor that she should not disclose such issues. Such is the condition of stigma around mental health in India.

I admit that even I would be like these judgemental pricks if I hadn't been diagnosed few years back. I am reading about these field for couple of years back and also reaching out to people who are in need. Because of my constant prodding one of friend who was depressed agreed to see therapist and now doing well. 

I just hope your tribe grows also if you are in need of volunteers I would be happy to help on weekends. Just guide me how to contact you guys. All the best. With the stigma around getting a therapy or visiting a therapist, what do you believe could make young adults, especially students seek help Thanks a lot for doing this AMA.

What I have been not able to understand is how to find the difference between mental health issue and some seasonal or life related problem leading to short term sadness or anxiety. 

More clearly, how to find out that it is time for seeking a therapist ? Y'all are doing God's work. Keep it up! As far as questions go:-

* Is there any work going on to add mental illness to existing medical insurance packages? I got my diagnosis and treatment done thanks to an employee assistance programme from my company, but my doctor (while amazing) charges a bomb for each consultation. Any ideas on how we, as citizens can help? 

* What are your views on [MAPS](http://www.maps.org/mdma/) and is there any organization that is currently trying to bring it to India?

* Are there any resources/ would you be interested in a resource for the effects of recreational drugs and ongoing mental illness? (something like iCall's crowdsourced list for mental health professionals)

* What are your thoughts on the cost of therapy overall? Do over-call therapies work (i.e. are there studies conducted on the same?) or is it best if the therapist is face-to-face with the patient?

* What are the most effective therapy styles that are available?
 I have lost my will and concentration to study. Often when I open up chapters I take long breaks between just few minutes. I have also started to get attached to video game and mobile games rather than productive work (programming). Help. is sex addiction a mental health issue? how is it different from just feeling horny all the time?

thank you. What can you tell me about adult ADHD in India? I am curious to know the position of the Indian mental health community on adult ADHD. From what I understand, ADHD is typically considered a child disorder here and awareness about adult ADHD is not quite prevalent as, it is in Western countries like the US. 

I suspect I have some degree of ADHD, based on the research I have done over the years. I would appreciate some advice on who to approach to get a proper diagnosis, possible treatment, etc. ideally in Bangalore.  
 A lot of people are asking about their personal mental health issues such as depression and a range of disorders. 

I wanted to ask something that has been bothering me for a long time. In many Indian cities I've visited, I couldn't help but notice that a fair amount of the homeless seem to have some sort of mental illness. Maybe they are homeless because they are mentally ill? I don't know. 

But these people scavenge for food, shelter and are treated like absolute filth by society. They're often dressed in torn and mangled clothes, speak incoherently and sometimes speak pure gibberish. Society shuns them without a second thought, and they are left to fend for themselves. Often, they are on the receiving end of ridicule and abuse.

They aren't easy to approach. They can be in the age range of 20-80, which is pretty wide. They may also have other physical disabilities. Many folks are even scared of them.

What steps, if any, has your foundation taken to help this sector of the mentally ill? 

I really am not criticizing if you are not, because I understand that you are a fairly new organization and may have not considered this issue yet and that your work might be concentrated towards personal mental health.

How do you think this particular sector of the mentally ill can be helped? [deleted] Thank you for doing this. Appreciate the support you're giving in raising awareness about an issue that's needlessly stigmatised.

Someone I know very closely is dealing with anxiety and depression, which is devastating their personal life. I'm trying to offer the best help I can, but I get conflicting advice on being 1) either too understanding or 2) Being tough to kick them out of the spiral of self pity and self loathing.

What should I do to help this person?

Also, it gets rough trying to help somebody everyday only to see no progress or even extreme regression sometimes. There are days when I feel like washing my hands off completely as I can't bear to go back to square one and repeating all the steps all over again.

Is that frustration normal or should I work on being more sympathetic?

Signing off for now ! Looking at the visa policies of these countries they're either eVisas or visas on arrival. How easy was the visa process, or was there any complications on this front that you encounter/would want to advice future travelers about?

Great route by the way. My dream is following this same plan but go into China after that and catching the trans-siberian train and ending up in Europe. Maybe one day! I have a question for Shanti, how did you manage to get 2 months leave from Police, heard they are usually very notorious in granting leaves. What are the toughest moments in the journey which changed you? Would you lead another group of girls on same route if you had the chance? I have a few questions:

* What city has the worst traffic? 

* What did you think when you saw the killing fields in Cambodia?

* What was your route, and how did you cross from India into Myanmar?

* Is Ha Long Bay the prettiest sight you saw? And how did it feel driving on the Hai Van Pass?

* How did you do all of this in 8 weeks? Did you just drive 300KM everyday without stopping/sightseeing? Self sponsered?  Would you advise any safety precautions? Kudos to you, ladies.

 Hi, Arnab.

Can we expect Republic to take up following issues and bring them into the mainstream:

* LGBT rights
* Climate change and what India is doing to tackle them
* Education and health at grassroot level
* Pollution, especially in Metro cities
* Privacy, encryption and security
* Net neutrality and free speech
* Individual freedom and liberties

Cheers for doing this AMA! Such a disappointing AMA. **This AMA's hashtag should be #Arnabdodges**.  Can we expect a better debate format?

* Only one mic active at a give time.


* An onscreen timer for each participant, showcasing the total duration their mic was active.


* Uniterrupted X unit of time is given to a participant to present their opinion.

 *ITT* - People losing respect for Arnab with every passing question.  Hi Arnab! It's good to have you here on reddit. I have a couple of questions:


1. You have been promoting Republic TV as an unbiased media outlet with no conflicts of interest. But with Rajeev Chandrashekhar, a strong BJP supporter and Rajya Sabha MP running the show, and Anupam Kher, another vocal BJP supporter whose wife is a BJP MP, being asssociated with the channel, how can you say that there won't be bias? And why was an article by The Wire highlighting the same taken down when you yourself advocate freedom of press?


2. You have talked about creating a media outlet with an Indian focus and a global audience, similar to the likes of BBC, CNN and RT. Do you aim to take Republic TV in that direction, or is it just a right-leaning news channel for local audience, a la Fox News? Whats so different about Republic news and why should I watch it? This AMA is worse than Rahul Gandhi's interview. Love you r/india ! I guess he thought its just another facebook Hi Arnab,

Would your channel be only talk shows or would you also have high quality documentaries and news shows like the BBC or Al Jazeera?

* How do you guys get access to him? 
* Whom did you approach? 
* What were you guys thinking when you started making this documentary? 
* What's your perception on Kejriwal base on your 1-1 interaction with him during the shoot? How different he really is than what is portrayed by the media?

Also fix this egregious blot on an otherwise brilliant movie:

""At 52:49, the person says that the temperature was 108 degrees which is in Fahrenheit, while the captions says it is 226 degrees Fahrenheit (that's 108 degree Celsius). Correct it.Ôªø""

Thanks for doing this AMA!

 I assume you spent some money on making the movie (not including your time value of money). How did you guys recover the spend? Thanks for the AMA.

1. How were you able to finalise on the narrative structure of the film?

2. How did you decided on the number of cameras angles for different shots? What were the parameters? Like you had multiple angles for the rally shot where AK and SD come face to face.


3. You were pretty innovative with the distribution of the film. Do you think it can be viable for independent cinema in general?
 
4. What are your upcoming projects?

And kudos to the shot outside cinema hall where AK was picking at his shirt! terrific attention to detail there. Hi! Thanks for the AMA, and congratulations for making an excellent film, easily one of my favourite documentaries this year.


Probably the biggest question everybody here has is how did you get access to Kejriwal and AAP's inner workings. Did you approach them? Through whom?


And secondly, how much was open, and what percentage of the party activities happened behind closed doors, inaccessible to you? Were there any specific restrictions put on you? We caught a glimpse of internal party meetings in the film, but AAP was accused of faltering on its ideal of transparency. If you are given a chance to make a film on someone other than Mr Kejriwal , than who would that be? The movie was brilliant, specially considering that it was your first movie and as Ravish sir said there will never be a political movie like this one in India because party's don't give access to film inside. 

1) You have filmed over 400 hours will there ever be part 2,3? When can we expect it to release?

2) What did Yogendra Yadav said after watching the movie?

3) You've been with Kejriwal for 1.5 years, What are your personal opinion on Arvind Kejriwal?

 Thanks for the AMA!

My questions are:

1) Why was Yogendra Yadav expelled from the party when it was clear he was their chief election strategist?

2) Did you personally interview any of YY, AK or PB during the making of this documentary?

3) Are you planning on making another one post AK becoming the CM of Delhi? Hey Vinay and Khushboo, thank you for doing this. 

1. This is a question concerning pre-shoot scripting: Did you have an idea before hand about how the film would turn out to be? Or did you discover the film along the journey or in the editing room?

2. A lot of reviews have spoken about how Yogendra Yadav comes out as the real protagonist of the film. Do you agree with this assessment, and if so, was that intentional? 
 Whats your next project? Specify Genre at least.  Will you release more material from your 400 hours of filming? Would it be in a movie form or something different like compilation of video clips uploaded on YouTube? Very few filmmakers get the kind of access  that you did. I wish regular politicians were covered the way AAP was in your film.

From your point of view, how open were AAP to granting access? What did Kejriwal say about it  - and what did Yogendra say?

* What tools do you use?  Keep it up. Designing album cover for God(Opeth) is a noble thing Hi Anoop, 

So whats up ? Hey Anoop! Awesome to see you doing an AMA. 

* What is your process in making artwork for bands? How do you start, make the concept? 

* How do you understand what the bands want? Are bands always happy with what they get? (I'm sure they are, but curious to see if anyone actually didn't like something)

* I've followed your work for about a year now. You seem to be very inspired by nature and foliage. How do you draw inspiration from this and apply it to music?


 Hey Anoop, terribly late for the party. But I would really appreciate if you can answer these for me.

1. What pen/pencil do you use n where to buy them in India?

2. How do you create original art?

3. How do you monetize your work? Any tips for amateurs.

4. Your personal take on getting into digital platform, I went into inkspace n even bought a wacom when I was broke. But still nowhere.

Keep up the good work, your art looks sick. I've been doing some using usual pen on silly papers, but not yet in any position to make anything original :( Hi! I'm an architecture student who loves designing logos and illustrations in free time!

So my question would be, how do you exactly balance between being an architect and an illustrator? Does one hinder with the other? And do you personally enjoy doing both?

Thank you! Hey Anoop, I just saw your website, incredible work! 

I loved to draw as a kid and used to do it all the time. At some point, I discovered DeviantArt and saw all the brilliant work there and became quite self-critical.

 Is it possible to do apolitical comedy and still keep it relatable for the youth? Much of today's comedy bashes political parties and while that is certainly enjoyable, it can get a tad monotonous. Have been following you since a long time. I truly connect with your line of thought and comedy. I have seen you grow through your clips of your stand up and rants on YouTube. The latest bit on dreams is the best one of yours. Keep it up, man. It's one of the best bits out there, much better than a lot of viral ones. 

It's okay not to go viral or trend. The content that goes viral isn't anyway the best content as the algorithms favour the content pandering to the lowest common denominator. 

Keep going. You will find your audience. Just don't lose the authentic and unique voice you have.

 Also, I have a couple of suggestions. 

Please work on your body language on stage. The thing you do with your hands, hinders your performance. 

Now that you have accepted your baldness, go full bald and keep a stubble. If it scares you initially, wear a hat. 

Upload more of your rants and random DIY on your channel.  Raghav, loved the link that you had shared.

What's your take on Kevin Hart's style of stand-up comedy ? Hey Raghav, I've been to a couple of your shows and really liked them. So the question I have for you today is- How is the Delhi comedy scene as compared to Mumbai and Bengaluru? And why did Abish move to Mumbai? >So guys, I'm off to play dota... 

I see you are a man of culture as well ;)

Do you play competitively or just casual? What role do you play? And fav heroes? Since you mentioned that you were among the first desis to take up stand-up comedy, how scary was it? What did you do before stand-up? In a nation of ""hurt sentiments"", how much of comedic work involves censoring the materials?

Edit: And done! Thanks for all the interesting questions. I had a great time answering all of them.",JairajDevadiga,AMA," Thank you for doing what you do and for doing this AMA.

1) Could you give an example of a free market, maybe in an Indian context? The only one that 'truly' seems like ( to me) it are those on the dark web or what is called the 'black market'.

2) In my limited understanding. I feel that in a free market aware, rational, educated (to some degree) and heterogeneous consumers (agents) are *necessary*. You'd expect continuous and 'perfect' flow of information also thus would be a necessary criteria. Would you agree? If yes, should (and if) the Government pull back from economic decisions and only educate consumers? Is that still a free market?

Sorry for the loaded questions. Don't have any economists as friends.  Thanks for doing this AMA. I have a few questions: 

1) Where does FEE get its funding from? 

2) You once wrote that ""The so-called intellectuals in academia, namely sociologists and political scientists, would like us to believe that this is a political or cultural problem. This doesn‚Äôt cut much ice. Caste divisions and the resulting violence are, fundamentally, an economic problem."" https://www.thequint.com/voices/blogs/the-economic-approach-to-stop-the-perpetuation-of-caste-divisions

Do you feel that by referring to qualified researchers who have conducted ground-level sociological and political analyses of how caste works as ""so-called intellectuals"" you are treating their research and work fairly? Could you point specifically to sociological and political science work that you feel fails your test of what is ""intellectual""? 

Is it not more accurate to accept that caste has social and political ramifications as well as economic ones? Can any of these really been taken in isolation? Is this not a gross oversimplification of an extremely complex issue? 

3) Regarding your article on arbitration: https://www.thequint.com/voices/blogs/can-markets-help-deliver-justice-cji-ts-thakur-supreme-court-njac-judicary-pending-cases-arbitration-tribunal

I found it surprising that you made no mention of the multiple legal efforts to bring down litigation, including existing ADR (alternative dispute resolution) mechanisms in India that exist apart from arbitration (e.g. mediation, conciliation, the Lok Adalat system, the conciliation system in family courts). Is there a reason that you excluded this aspect? Obviously the legal system in India needs a lot more work, but the first step is probably an accurate analysis of the existing conditions right?

I may sound weird but isn't real estate (*housing + commercial) a major cause of corruption & black money ? Is their a possibility that it can be totally under government & it's I'll effect? 1. What should the government of India do to improve healthcare in India, especially for the poor? 

2. Do you have a favorite politician, dead or alive?  How do you see India's growth rates in the short to medium term? And what do you think about the programs like""Make in India"" and ""Startup India""? Did these schemes achieve or atleast started to show their effects n our economy? > free markets and private property rights

Q1.Which school of economic thought would you consider yourself to be an adherent of?

1. Austrian (Mises, Hayek)

1. Chicago (Milton Friedman)

1. general garden variety neo-liberalism

1. Libertarian

Q2.What are your thoughts on the bail-in bill? (FRDI)

Q3.Do you think Government should intervene to bail-out ailing, too-big-to-fail financial system or should it allow the system to fail as a natural process of creative-destruction? Which are your favourite books on Economics, and India in general. Would love to have some contemporary recommendations. Article sources are also fine. Thanks for this opportunity:

1. After having seen numerous reports about flawed data from CSO regarding economic data, do you think it is a cause of concern or just fear mongering?

2. Does the present GDP calculation method count in all the aspects of India's new age services? or does it need a revision to keep up with the times? If yes, how much change can be expected?
 in Past 20 years, if you look at real estate as a metric, a flat that used to cost 50 lacs in now 5 CR's in metro cities like Bombay. What gives, how are ppl to afford a place to live. Its getting crazy now.  Do you believe the current byzantine political system of India needs reformation or massive reduction before Free Markets can be effectively introduced? I've heard India is one of the most bureaucratic countries and very hard to set a business up in.  1. What is your opinion of GST, particularly the implementation?

2. I am of the view that the indian government is an extortion agency for the salaried middle class primarily because we end up paying consumption taxes like everyone else but also pay income tax, which many avoid. It is my opinion that income tax in india should be abolished for this reason and that everyone must pay consumption taxes.

What are your views on the lack of laws against martial rape? If you are against criminalization of martial rape, could you please tell me why? 

Do you have numbers on men being falsely accused? If not, do you plan on conducting a study to gather these numbers?

Men's Rights Activism has attracted some of the vilest misogynists of the world to its cause, what are your views on these men?

What steps has your organization taken in changing the law that basically declares that men cannot be raped?

Thanks everyone, it was an enjoyable AMA! Thanks for some great questions, and I hope I was able to answer them to your satisfaction. With this, I close this discussion.

Website: http://SatSure.co",PBasu,AMA," Hi! Thanks for the AMA. 

1) How easy would it be for the average farmer to incorporate this technology into their existing systems, given the lack of technical expertise?

2) Could you explain the process in a more rudimentary manner so that I'd be able to understand better too?


 Great Initiative , but given that average farm land holding in India is very small how do a small farmer benefit from data ? What do you think of drones with high tech cameras and sensors that can do the same jobs as super expensive space satellites at much lesser cost. Drones aren't hindered by the clouds for visibility either.

How will satellites compete.   1. Can you please give us examples of certain metrics or data points you can share about farmers?

2. Do you have any tie ups with Indian MFIs, NBFCs or Banks for this information?

3. Are there companies outside Indian who share similar info with insurance and lending companies abroad? I'm interested in aerospace and been following the developments closely. I'm a fellow subscriber to r/isro and r/spacex. 

1) How do I apply to your company? I really am interested

2) What advise would you give to a young guy in his 20's who's looking to start a company? Hello Prateep. Great initiative and amazing progress. I have few questions more on science part.

1. I presume you monitor NDVI (and some other vegetation index) values form satellite data and trends as the crop grows to keep a check of its health. Do you use any improvement on these methods for the same? Has there been validation of the data through ground based measurements specifically for your work?
2. A follow up to what I asked in first point. Are there any plans to setup your own IoT based setup in the fields for further improvement of your methods.
3. How did you go about the funding at the initial stage of your startup? From where were you able to gain investments at that time? 
4. Do you use opensource softwares (QGIS) for your work or paid ones? What do you think is the future and role of community guided open source technologies and softwares as means of improvement vs  usage of specific enterprise based softwares which can restrict the usage to certain specific users? Will things improve if we move towards sharing based technology progress?  Thanks for doing this, I have following two questions.   
1. Is there any lack of credit for farmers? All banks have mandatory priority sector lending and many MFIs also work in this sector, so demand must be met. Also why farmers demand to waive off credit. Is this justified ? OR just for political reasons govt does this?      
2. About Crop Insurance how much is the demand ? I feel insurance is bit complicated concept than Credit. Do farmers understand it fully? Also do you think Crop / other insurance can be very beneficial for improving financial status of farmers ? I don't see many Big Insurance companies doing it, means it's not very viable business?    Hey! Thanks for doing this! A few tangentially related q's: 

1)Do you plan(or even need) to set up your own hardware(in space)? With lots of smallsat launchers being introduced(RocketLab, Vega, now Isro's new LV), orbital access is slowly getting cheaper. 

2)Where do you think the Indian Space Program will be in <10 years time? Again, with the smaller launch companies offering lower costs, do you think customers will be drawn *away* from ISRO? Will ISRO be sustainable?

3)What was ISRO like in terms of red-tape,  development speed, and general direction?

Thank you!  First) Dont you think it is a bit over the top for Indian farmers right now with big data and image processing. Yes it is help but the problems for Indian farmers are much different and much more basic. 

One I can think of is access to water so that they dont have to be reliant on Rain Gods which was solved by western countries decades ago. 

Second) My other question is since you are an entrepreneur can you say one can become a billionaire or even a millionaire ($ terms) in agri/poultry business in India? From what I believe as economy grows number of people who will consume meat & fruits (not just grains as is the case currently for the BPL population)  will increase as well as present meat & fruit consumers will consume much more. So I sense that there is a real opportunity here but I just cant put a finger on it.  >towards creating a positive impact on the lives of farmers by helping improve crop insurance, innovate on Agri lending services, and improve market linkages by creating intervention and decision intelligence frameworks for Agri value chain stakeholders.

Eh?? Can you speak simple English?  Your website is filled with similar jargon. 

What is the product/service and what problem does it solve?? Or is a tech solution looking for a problem to solve? Who is your typical customer?

How do you explain what you do to an average person or farmer? Who are some other players who work on satellite imagery and data in India, especially for non-urban use? ", YourDadHatesYou Random_entropy Bapu_Ji Monsultant AdityaRav sargasticgujju None LemonMellon None FourthWiseMonkey sandygrains
"Hello Reddit; we are students at IIT Indore, currently in protest against the administration. Ask us anything!",245,7vw2s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7vw2s8/hello_reddit_we_are_students_at_iit_indore/,75,1518038919.0,"Hello /r/India,

We are students of IIT Indore who are currently in protest against certain antagonistic actions of the administration, laws and rules violation, dissolution of students gymkhana when issues are raised and the general official attitude of the administration that the students do not have a say in the official functioning of the institution.

[Our previous thread is linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7rq17h/requesting_help_from_redditors_for_the_entire/), as well as a few older ones about this particular IIT [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5824lx/iitindore_to_introduce_60_hostel_reservation_for/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4s29ba/pg_students_at_iit_indore_are_facing_some_severe/).

As you can clearly see in the aforementioned three threads, our IIT has been at the centre of controversy for years, mainly due to an administration that believes in an autocratic style of functioning. This is an IIT in which even faculties and staff are not allowed to speak to media (this is actually part of the IIT Indore statutes).

The aforementioned three reddit threads should provide the relevant background on the origin and cause of the current standoff and lack of official/written communication between students and the administration.

With that said and done, we welcome questions from the community at /r/India. We would also like you to go through the **[announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7vtxad/ama_announcement_protesting_students_from_iit/)** for this AMA, where a brief (!!) background is given for the issues at hand.

Thank you all for your valuable time. As the issues are still not solved, we would greatly appreciate if any mediapersons reading this AMA would reach out to us.

**10-02-2018: We're back and will be answering questions whenever possible!**
**If you want to support us, please help spread the twitter hashtags #IIT_Indore and #saveiitindore. Thanks!**",CallForHelp_STUD,AMA," Peaceful protest is your right. Be there till you guys have strength. But please don't resort to violence. It will make all the hard efforts that you guys made worthless.Don't be afraid of the threats given by the professors. Nobody can hold your degree or won't let you pass.  
How is the unity among students ? Are you guys united in this cause or are there still some people refusing to go with you being afraid that their career will be screwed ?  Hello I am from Yopics.co.uk and we are a international media non-profit, how can we help?

 Are any of the teachers/anyone from the administration secretly/openly supporting you in this protest? Which incident was the tipping point that forced you to protest? I understand movement outside the campus is restricted. 
1. As of today, does it continue to be so?
2. Why are they restricting movement?
3. This seems to have spiraled out of control from the incident with the mess caterers' issue. Was there any other issue in the background that the outside world is not aware of that lead to this going out of control?
4. Have their been any actions taken by any parties towards a resolution? Parents, Govt., College administration, etc?


 1) Have you guys tried contacting professors / administrators who might know the current administration? 

2) Have you asked other IITs for support? Some IITs will have a really vocal student community, and it can help for the news to spread to them to see if they can assist in any manner. It could be that someone there has good contacts within media / politics to help your cause. 

3) Have you talked to someone at IIT-BHU? They held similar protests (although the reasons were different), and I believe they were successful in making the administration do the right thing.

4) The IIT act should also empower a board of governors for IIT-I. Have you tried getting in touch with these people as well?  Has the intensity of your protest changed over time? How can we help your cause? What can we do to help you apart from bringing attention to the issue through social media? What are the violations of law that have occurred according to you? Where have they violated fundamental rights? You might want to contact Pinjra Tod, and other possible allies. Contact the new media, like scroll, the wire, and youthkiawaaz. Have someone anonymously write an article.  What is gymkhana? ", bijeta2016 LukeA1Yopics mr_opmerker None riddlerftw cheesesneezes None lordpotatopotato MKingsMan None None

Hi Shashi, advanced happy Vishu.

your winning margin came from 1 Lakh in 2009 votes to 15 Thousand in 2014 , any opinion about this?
Any specific achievemnets you as MP in Thiruvanathpuram which directly impacted people?
MY REPLY:
Yes, at a time when the BJP had hopes of winning in the midst of the Modi wave, and in a place that is their strongest constituency in Kerala, I think my second victory is a tribute to the work I've done for the people.
Plenty of achievements to point to, especially a National Highway Bypass that ahd been stalled for 40 years before i took up the challenge, and dozens more that have transformed the lives of lakhs of people. More details here: http://www.shashitharoor.in/mp-reports.php [I was the first Indian MP to issue regular reports to his constituents on work done] How do you see the situation of mental health awareness in India. As a person already suffering from mental health issues and getting affected by social stigmas which makes recovery even more difficult, I can say the situation is pretty bad. 

Who do you think can play a huge role in improving a situation like this and what can be done at different levels? What can we expect from politicians like you? Can we expect you to raise these issues in the parliament? Thanks to all for 383 questions, most of which involved multiple queries! I've answered as many as I could in an hour (and I type fast).

Shashi Tharoor 1. Sir, with a lot of countries gravitating towards right wing policies (Brexit and resultant instability in the UK, Trump Election, and now the rising popularity of the likes of Le Pen in France), what impact does this have on India from a diplomatic standpoint? Will we see an even more dominating west on a global scale, or is this limited to their internal policies?

1. How do you see the rising influence of Russia? Which book would you recommend to a typical Indian youth?  Hi! Sir.

With the introduction of 2 amendments to Finance Bill, which eliminate the cap on corporate giving and abolishing the provision that firms must declare their political contributions on their profit and loss statements, BJP has made the system of political funding more opaque rather than making it transparent. And so far, we have seen no significant opposition from any political party on this.>Do you think it is an opportunity for Congress to counter BJP in 2019 by taking this serious issue to common people in its campaign and by sourcing its own funding through direct fundraising from people?

How confident are you in decriminalization of Homosexuality in Kerala? 

Its great that you are trying to pass it through Kerala Assembly, hopefully our Honourable Chief Minister will decide to go forward with it. 


Cheers!  Hi Shashi,

1.)  Would you say that Condoleeza Rice succeeded in her mission to get a not so strong Secy Gen of UN?  
    

2.) Would you say that there is a hope for US to be relatively less sneaky and doing that sort of thing (like vetoeing your candidature) under President Trump? 
    

3.)  How do you think India US bilateral relations would fare under President Trump who on one hand considers himself a friend of India but is working actively on limiting legal immigration from India to US through H1Bs ?
  

  
    

4.)  How did you get that role in the movie 'Andaaz Apna Apna' ?
  
    

5.)  Since Cong will never let you become an independent PM (I mean we all know what happened after UPA1 when MMS did an excellent job but then Ms. Gandhi became fearful of his growing popularity and thus we were able to see the disaster that UPA2 was) because you werent born from the womb of a person whose last name was 'Gandhi', would you ever consider moving to a different party?

 Harsha, here's a difficult one for you rightaway: I have often wondered and now I ask you - we know that you are back, but are you really? Will it ever be the same again? Or will you always have that fear of an impending embargo? It is hard to believe that everything is going to be the same. Hi, apart from all the cricket questions you will be facing

Just wanted to share with you a cool thing I stumbled upon recently. I was searching the internet about a true crime case and I came across a random comment on a random true crime blog where the commenter mentioned that she was the daughter of the famous (in his niche at least)  RS Kulkarni*. Her last name was Bhogle, so I googled the name and found out she was indeed your wife. It was cool finding out two famous people in two very different fields were related in some way.

So to ask a question, do you and your wife discuss about your father in law and his cases? Although I know its not for everyone, are you and your wife interested in her father's work?

Apart from the published books of your father in law, do you guys have any other material of his that's not confidential?

Also what's your favourite place in Hyderabad that's not related to cricket? Any memorable incidents you are willing to share?

Thanks for doing this AMA.

* For anyone interested, RS Kulkarni was a DCP of Mumbai police when a famous Indian serial killer Raman Raghav was captured and tried for his murders. He also handled several other important cases but this was the case through which I came to know about him. Hi Harsha , Thanks for doing AMA .  
My question is about Ashwin and his consistent poor show in overseas. Why do you term him a Modern Legend.   
In India he picks 5 wkts in every innings but come overseas he goes wicketless in every match.   
What not give chance to Kuldeep Yadav or Amit Mishra. I wasn't expecting so many questions and while I would be very happy to answer many more, I need to go somewhere. I am sorry I took a little longer to get my head around this but now that I have, maybe I can do it again. Do leave your questions and I will answer them when I am back. Thank you very much for your support. As I said on twitter, I am often moved by it and it has meant a lot to me. Cheers. And have fun with cricket. It is a great sport. Are you planning to bring back the ESPN school quiz or a show along similar lines? What is the most memorable moment in your career so far?
 Hello Harsha. Just one curious question -

How is it like hanging out with Rahul Dravid? [deleted] What was your ""oops"" moment (if any) while in the commentary box ?  Hi Harsha, thanks for doing this AMA.

",ArrangedMarriagePC,AMA," Seriously i don't know you people. Can you tell what exactly it is.., Do you think it is for the better that arranged marriages are declining even in India? I always found the idea of an arranged marriage odd. Does it take a toll, emotionally, to have to date so many people for short durations in a short span, all the while thinking a about getting married to this person or potentially the next? What inspired you to start this podcast? Thanks for AMA and congratulations for the weeding

  


1. You don't know the other person - how can you get married? Is that the arrange marriage that bad?

  


2. You desies outsides were free to chose your partner than why arrange marriage?

  


3. What are the advantages of arrange marriage over love marriage?

   - as asked by /u/SilentSaboteur Earlier this [year](https://the-ken.com/ken-announces-angel-funding/) The Ken got angel funding. I was surprised to see the list being dominated by startup folks. I really find that as a conflict of interest.

After that funding round, have you (or the ken) has published any articles which shows those startups or the startups funded by those VCs, in a negative light or any criticism pieces? 

list of startups: Taxi For Sure/Ola, Freshdesk, FusionCharts, PayTm and some are VCs including Softbank. I was a business journalist. Everyone used to take gifts from P.R's and other cronies. I know for a fact that Google gave away a lot of free Pixel phones to journalists. My question is, how much is tech journalism a front for P.R as I never got the chance to get into tech journalism? 

Also, I'm now into digital marketing as I felt job security, 'decent' pay, holidays and independence to do stories should be forgotten once you enter mainstream journalism in India.

I believe you started The Ken to avoid everything that I mentioned above, so how has it been going really? I miss journalism but I really don't see how it has any potential for personal growth unless you sell yourself to the highest bidder.       do you think the indian startup scene is a joke? copied from the US and little original thought? all solutions searching for problem? 1) Will you ever release old articles to nonsubscribers?

2) Can there be a model where a person can pay to read just one article of there choosing?



   - as asked by /u/UraniumTatti Remember that Foodpanda story you did back when you were at Mint? I loved it! And you know what the best thing is, I never really cared about foodpanda or even startups and I still loved reading it.

Don't you think The Ken is laser focussed on startups and nothing else? You guys have incredible people on board, would you like to venture into other areas within business journalism? Like say, reporting on a particular sector. 

Eg. There's talk of electric cars or cars running on renewable energy becoming a major mode of transport in the future, in India. And therefore you do a story on Motherson Sumi or Exide and how those companies and others will play a role. Just saying, could be big :) What are you doing differently at The Ken than you did at Mint? LOWER THE SUBSCRIPTION PRICES! Geez

The game is based on Indian Mythology. 6 PM to 8PM IST!,146,7dc49r,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7dc49r/ama_we_are_nodding_heads_games_the_studio_behind/,103,1510864823.0,"Greetings guys!! We are Nodding Heads Games, based in Pune, India! We're making ""Raji: An ancient Epic"" an action adventure game set in Ancient India! Ask us anything!! 

We're live on Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1343822689/raji-an-ancient-epic?ref=7yk9bn

Game Trailer: https://youtu.be/tbAlRzvfBRw",NoddingHeadsGames,AMA," Apart from kickstarter, have you shopped your concept of the game to other publishers in the country?

Has there been any response? Do you feel that events of historical importance (such as the revolt of 1857, etc) are viable settings for potential games in the future? What can you tell us of the plot apart from what the Kickstarter page shows?

How many weapons are you planning to include in the game?

(just for the lulz) will we have lootboxes? It seems I've logged-in at the right time. Here are my questions:
1. Are you using a pre-existing game engine?
2. If not, how long did it take for you to write your own?
3. If you have indeed written your own game engine, what is the process like? what are the hardest parts?
4. All the above questions aside, what is your technology stack? Hey guys. I like the game, have seen the trailer/vids quite before the AMA announcement. I'm just sad at how your kickstarter is progressing. Have you approached any of the big studios with this? What do you plan?... because quite frankly, it'd be a shame to drop something this good that's homegrown...

Cheers, wish you guys get there. Greetings from Athens, Greece! First of all your game is beautiful and I hope you reach your Kickstarter goal. My question is: What did you do in order to build an audience for your game prior the ks launch and how long before it?
 Will it be available on steam and if so how much would be the price for it? Can we expect some riots when this game is released? Hello devs, thank you for the AMA. This game is worth hyping over imo since we never had any major Indian game since [Agni's release](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/first-homegrown-pc-based-game-agni-launched/articleshow/2802216.cms). Here are some questions that I have been pondering over 

1. Since this game's plot is settled around Ancient India, what will be the language of the in-game character's dialogue (if there is one)? If it is in Hindi, are you people gonna utilize local voice actors since Ubisoft did a shoddy job regarding voice talent and transliteration of various in-game world's text for Far Cry 4.

2. ***How will you handle flak from religious organisations?*** Lets hope that it never happen, but still, there are lots of people out there, ready to get offended over even the slightest cultural misappropriation. You guys must be already familiar with a certain ""statesman"" who has made a career out of getting offended by games and animes; how will you handle that in future?

3. I have zero ideas about game development- cost, script, programming, debugging is way out of my league. Your game is getting funded by a kickstarter campaign which only reached 14% of the required goal. Don't you think its super ambitious from your side to announce console release in advance? (Apologies if this question ends up offending you)


PS:- sorry for poor grammar  The mechanics/gameplay of which existing games served as an inspiration for Raji? Why do you think has the whole game development market not taken off in India? I'm pretty sure it'd be cheaper to make a game here than say in the US. Is it due to lack of talent?

My question to you is that what made you incline towards making the issue of other women your life cause, especially when even otherwise you could have led a decent life in any city.

Also, hardly anyone in today's youth seem to have that calling of working towards others' cause, what would be your message to inspire us.

Many amongst us believe that we first ought to do well for ourselves before we do anyone's good, and that well doesn't arrive at all, since our wants in life keep on ascending.  You are indeed an inspiration. Many congratulations on your work and for your own personal achievement of co-chairing at the WEF. 

I was wondering if you could give me some advice at a very basic level. I've always wanted to do something to contribute to social causes, but I lack in inter-personal skills and lack having the experience of navigating inter-personal dynamics that drive social interactions. I give money and donate material when I can, but it is not fulfilling enough since I want to do some direct action, however lack the skills or confidence. I could probably learn so much more from the women you work with, from their strength and resilience, rather than me giving them something to help with social causes. Could you suggest some ways an introvert with not much confidence to help out with an org such as Mann Deshi or other such orgs?

Would you mind sharing your views on Bharatiya Mahila Banks and its merger with SBI? Is the wider network doing good for rural women in general or has it reduced the primary objectives. Thank you.

 Is it realistic to envision an India in which the women of this country are on an equal socio-economic standing with men? If so, how far into the future do you think this is a plausible scenario, and what according to you are the greatest impediments to its realisation? According to you, how badly did demonetization affect rural women's economic condition last year? Has there been any respite after re-monetization? Great work Chetna , since I am from a village too and have seen how hard working women folk there are and the raw deal which they generally get ,your work is in a much needed area , more power to you

* how difficult is to start a women bank now , procedurally ?

* How do you ensure there is no corruption and best accounting ,ethical standards are followed . Given what recently  happened in Bihar cooperative bank where govt. money was funnelled out (srijan scandal)

* Could you give us some details like ( your loan book , profits , no. Of customers -employees ) which would help us gauge the scale of your operations 

* Where do you see your bank 5 years from now ( do you want to grow or want to do different things on womens issue withing same region )

Hey everyone!

I am Jaya Ramchandani. I am a science communicator and have recently started to teach IB physics and general science.

I have been working with innovative educational projects making astronomy and physics accessible to the general public. 

Today, I am here to answer questions related to interdisciplinary projects like art meets science, informal, out-of-the classroom learning, and lifelong learning for all.

I co-founded 'The Story Of' Foundation because while studying physics I found that a lot of the concepts at the atomic and particle level are similar to Eastern philosophy. So I started to ask the question then, why doesn‚Äôt contemporary science talk more often to Eastern philosophy? That was one of the bigger motivations behind setting up the platform. We involved artists and designers in a big way because they are great at thinking about abstract topics and giving them form.

You can see our past project The Story of Light 2015 here: www.thestoryoflight.org. The Story of Light received international recognition in the UN‚Äôs International Year of Light education and outreach panel. 

In the upcoming project, The Story of Space 2017, http://www.thestoryof.org/space2017/ we welcome everyone to join us in Goa from 10th November to 19th November for our festival. The Story of Space provides unique learning experiences around space exploration, migration, urban architecture and other contemporary issues associated with the word ‚Äòspace‚Äô. Essentially, we explore ‚Äòspace‚Äô from multiple perspectives. Artists, scientists, educators, and philosophers have all come to Goa to create live experiences, a film program, installations, workshops, talks, and panels. The 10-day festival is for the general public, across generations, and is FREE for all to experience. Story of Space 2017.

We are a Non-profit NGO and are a volunteer run project. You can make contributions on our page (link below). If you can't give anything but still want to support our cause please share our link with your friends, family and co-workers. With more people aware of our cause, we will be one step closer to our goal. Donate - http://www.thestoryof.org/space2017/donate

",JayaRamchandani,AMA," Hello Jaya. Great initiatives and work! congratulations. I have few questions.

1. What are your ideas on changing (or should I say overhaul) the current education system in our country. Especially in STEM field. Also how do you think we can implement science education while many from off STEM field argue that they don't need (perceived complicated theory) later in their life?
2. About this:

> I co-founded 'The Story Of' Foundation because while studying physics I found that a lot of the concepts at the atomic and particle level are similar to Eastern philosophy. So I started to ask the question then, why doesn‚Äôt contemporary science talk more often to Eastern philosophy?

This is really great. But how do we prevent people from misusing the eastern philosophy to claim things which are completely unscientific. I know there is lot of wisdom in our past but people often tend to take it in wrong way and claim everything to be 'Science'. I am sure there is way to learn and talk about it in historic and philosophical context. But how do we do it?
 I wanna ask something, but don't know what.. I  couldnt understand what you do. Ofcourse I don't mean it as an insult, but maybe I am not smart enough to comprehend your expertise. Do you believe in a God? And do you think God and science can co-exist? what parallels between eastern philosophy and particle physics have you found? and which aspects of eastern philosophy do you think should be taught in science classes? hi, is your website associated with medium? ""I co-founded 'The Story Of' Foundation because while studying physics I found that a lot of the concepts at the atomic and particle level are similar to Eastern philosophy.""

1. Can you share some of the similarities?
2. Eastern philosophy is huge. So, do you focus on any particular darshan shaastra?
 > while studying physics I found that a lot of the concepts at the atomic and particle level are **similar to Eastern philosophy**


Not sure how I feel about this. It reminds me of [Sam Harris](https://youtu.be/hU6TkfCGlX8?t=447) saying this

>What you do and what many people do when you invoke spooky physics in service of propping up their religious and new age intuition is .. Because Quantum Mechanics is spooky and difficult to understand and because what you are saying is difficult and spooky and difficult to understand, they must somehow be related; or somehow they must be mutually supportive. And that's fundamentally not true.

>They are arrived at by completely different methodologies and ways of thinking..


I personally would like to leave eastern philosophy (that has religious connotations) completely out of science. Hello Jaya,

Did you, by any chance, got motivated by Capra's Tao of Physics? I got interested into the eastern philosophy correlation after reading it. How can one collaborate or volunteer with you guys, does it require physics background?

Thank you how can I be a volunteer in your ngo ? What are some of the biggest challenges you have faced running such an organisation in India ?

The leading showman, Arnab Goswami on Republic said that you have a crumbling news website and you people tried to tarnish his reputation just for garnering views. Is it true?


When are you going to have a seperate section for opinion pieces on your news website? How far do you think (as many believe) that a overtly left wing bias in the media the world over is responsible for fuelling the global resurgence of right-wing sentiment? Do you remember any instance(s) where-- in retrospect or otherwise-- felt that you unfairly criticized someone? If yes, do you take any measures to not repeat the error.
 Fake news is exploding in India, a country which has 50 million WhatsApp accounts and 200 million Facebook users. It is everywhere: created by propagandists and shared by impressionable people. And there are many instances where fake news has had real life consequences, leading to actual violence and people getting hurt.

But then it can also be argued that lying is a part of free speech, and any law to curb fake news will be grossly misused to censor the press and free speech in general.

What can be done to stop the spreading of fake news without violating free speech? Would your site focus more on Jobs and Economic issues more? since, at the end of the day that's what matters for majority of Indians.

Why is there so little discussion (by Media) on Job creation in the country? since India need 12-14 Million jobs a year. Demographic disaster or Demographic dividend? [deleted] Mr Vardarajan, you are a prominent critic of Mr Modi and have been for years. I'd love to understand how that impacts your job. 

Has anyone linked to our PM ever acknowledged your criticism of him? What was it like?

Does this impact you and your magazine in a tangible way? You receive your share of online trolling but is there anything more than that? From Advertisers, Investors or other stakeholders I really enjoy Wire (Love the series more thougj xD)
 Though I am not as well read as most people but kudos on doing a good job.

1.Major ethical issues you've faced in your journey ?

2. Thoughts on whether there is a mainstream left bias among journalists in India. 

 [deleted] I love the depth of your journalism, and sincerely want you to do well. This criticism is coming from a supporter - not a detractor.

I feel that having a consistent anti-NDA stance hurts your credibility. If your objective is to inform and influence a wide array of readers throughout the country (instead of simply feeding the liberal/anti-BJP bubble), should you not also highlight the positive things done by the government? I feel that Jansatta does this well. They have enormously hard-hitting articles against the government (and were the first major outlet to report on the recent Patan riots), but also write articles that praise the government when it does a good job. The Wire, however, seems to be consistently anti-BJP.

Because of this, ""neutral"" content that you publish does not get much traction (atleast on social media). For instance, your recent post on the [delay in sanctions for Yogi Adiyanath's Hate Speech](https://thewire.in/134412/adityanath-allahabad-high-court-hate-speech-riot/) received 245 shares on Facebook at the time of writing. However, your post on [why Muslim women should embrace a Uniform Civil Code](https://thewire.in/134268/muslim-women-uniform-civil-code/) only received 12 shares. Moreover, according to my privately built analytics tools, the audience that engaged with the anti-Adityanath post was around 40% Muslim, while the audience that engaged with the pro-UCC post was only around 20% Muslim. These statistics (and I have plenty more examples) mean that you might be feeding an outrage-bubble of those against the government rather than informing the general electorate.

In view of this:

1. Why do you have a consistently negative slant against the government? I understand that the press and the government should have an adversarial relationship, but do you not feel that you go too far?
2. In your opinion, what is a good way to cover the Kashmir and the Bastar situation? A sizeable number of Kashmiris and Naxalites clearly want be separate from India. Do you feel that it is anti-national (in the true sense of the word) for the mainstream media to show the rebels/separatists side of the story?
3. The subscription model for news seems like its beginning to work for large American dailies like the NYT and WashPo.

how do you make people aware of the business model and its legitness?

Also, the idea of all of this is okay, but its still gonna be very limited even at its peak, not sure but many entrepreneurs just grab the invested money, make bucks and leave since many if not all start ups don't have a money making model that can be incorporated, comments on this??


lastly how do you make money? if tomorrow all of the retailers you take coupons from start handling out their own cash backs and make up a system similar to yours wouldn't it take your firm out on this? Hey Swati, loving the attitude, you did walk in to an AMA which could've been all guns on you, you did excellent.

As a two time startup guy who managed to get acquired (fairly happy) both the times - touchwood-, I'd like to know where do you see CK going? A possible exit by acquisition? 

Additionally, what drives bigger business motifs for you - niche ecommerce or mass multi vendor? 

I was also consulting one of the biggest coupons startups a few years back, and thought they would be far bigger now - but they couldn't innovate at the rate at which they should have (still one of the biggest..hint hint..elephant :P ), lack of innovation and burning to build a quasi loyalty program does end up draining most of the money out of the system for some players in the similar space. 

r/India doing me a prod as well by maintaining decorum.  This feels like a good AMA by reading all the answers. So how's your normal day like Swati?  Yes, I have read them. Both Amazon and Flipkart are well aware of our business model.. we work with their teams directly and in fact they tell us about all their upcoming promotions in advance, even buy extra advertisement space. They don't like us giving Cashback as real cash hence, you will see on CashKaro that we offer CashKaro Rewards for Amazon and Flipkart shooping - these can be withdrawn as Amazon/Flipkart Gift Vouchers rather than NEFT transfer. So there is no issue really.. they may not work with every Cashback site but they do work with us in a legitimate manner. 

https://cashkaro.com/stores/flipkart
https://cashkaro.com/stores/amazon (in fact Amazon informs us every month which categories are allowed for Cashback - these change every month)  
Total staff strength? Why should someone use CashKaro and not other Cashback websites? (Other websites have better UI and similar offers IMO) On a scale of KRK to SRK this is Tiger Shroff üòÇ Do you sell customer data? Isn't cashback industry too dependent on online retailers? What if tomorrow Flipkart and Amazon starts to provide cashback directly to consumers like Paytm? Do you think they don't already do so because it is not a profitable business practice? In the AMA announcement there was a comment which suggested that CashKaro had not followed through on the rebate for the person. How often does this happen? Do you track this as the CEO? What are you doing to prevent it?

Looking at your Facebook page, the top 2-3 reviews are from former interns or current employees. Are you comfortable with what that insinuates about your business? Hi swati , thanks for doing AMA

Delighted to be here for this Ask Us Anything! Look forward to chatting",rchopses,AMA," I'm going to bring up the controversial issues here:

1. Demonetisation: I wasn't affected by it but my family's business was. I get the feeling that the majority of people on this sub have no idea how hard it is to run a business in india. What are your opinions on this?

2. GST: Again, i know the pain because my family's business was brought to its knees by the slipshod way in which this was implemented. your thoughts? How could this be improved? 

There is currently zero clarity on how much GST we have to pay and what exactly will happen to any excess money that we've paid. Even our accountant is clueless and is recommending a ""GST expert"" who (to me) seems to be a glorified clown preying on the ignorant. What are your thoughts on (possibly) paid twitter trends such as the one being orchestrated as we speak (https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhyMediaSilentNow?src=tren)? I ask this question in the context of twitter specifically since you guys seem to have an active presence there.

Edit: To add to that example, couple of days ago there was a trend being run by Ram Rahim (go figure) followers and some of the tweets were openly homophobic.  1) Where do you guys see yourself in the future? Would you be looking to expand your venture or continue to take the same direction? 

2) How did IndiaExplained happen? 

3) How do you view the changes happening in India in the recent times, from an NRI perspective? This is a bit of a long read: https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7c0mjv/an_institution_collapses_update_on_what_is/

Two suggestions: maybe do a podcast episode on this and the pitiful state of the judiciary in india.

two: maybe do a podcast episode about this AMA. You have some good company if you look at the list of past AMAs (including one Chopra woman and the erudite Mr Tharoor). (reposting for the benefit of everyone else as the previous thread was deleted)

Hi there. I enjoy your podcast but i find the intro strange and the outro too long.

1. WTF does the intro mean? Did you use autotune at some point? Edit: you didn't answer the autotune question in the previous thread.

2. I particularly loved the two episodes on the NRI issue. This sub is rabidly anti-NRI but, personally, i've long maintained that if you are middle class in india, you absolutely should emigrate simply because the West objectively offers you more bang for every ounce of effort. Your thoughts? (My ""signature"" rallying cry on this sub has become ""Emigrate, people!"". :) Clarification: Emotional issues aside, my point is solely the quality of life you can achieve if you emigrate to the West and work there. Everyone has a different emotional reaction and there is often no right and wrong. The decision, in the end, depends on your capacity to stomach change and make the most of your own situation.

Edit: For the benefit of everyone here, the two NRI episodes: 

https://soundcloud.com/indiaexplained/special-episode-the-nri-part-i

https://soundcloud.com/indiaexplained/the-nri-part-2

3. Do you think voting rights for NRI should be a thing? I am all for it but not voting by proxy as (given that this is india) That will simply become yet another avenue for vote manipulation and corruption.

Cheers! Hi Guys.. do you think Hinduism as a religion has somehow escaped as much scrutiny and criticism that the Abrahamic religions and other cults like Mormonism and Scientology have had to face by various western rationalists/commentators? I genuinely think the impact that Hindutva can have on India is extremely alarming but it simply does not get international coverage enough. hey guys, I'm keen to know what do you feel of the major politicians in the country ( it is somewhat clear from your tweets but still). I mean, comments on the 3-4 major politicians in the country, and what do you guys feel about them, or their governance? At least tell us Bunty kya bolta hai, please?  Okay folks, so we'll wrap up now. Thank you so much! A pleasure chatting and keep listening to the podcast and following us on Twitter Thanks for you responses. Just need a personal advice. How to deal with relatives who subscribe to ideology which neither legal and not moral as per my standards? And these are unavoidable relations. I don't bicker with them anymore but deep down there is always some resent for not speaking up when they are wrong. How do you claim that democracy in India is strong?

Do you consider all propaganda as fake news? Or do you use a specific definition. Without this anything can be labelled as fake news. 

What I do not agree with is Fake News.

EDIT: just to give an example. There are many Ayurvedic claims in News what do you make of them? Do you get threats from propagandists?  How do you deal with accusations of political bias? I think that most misinformation emerges from right wing troll armies, so how do you deal with the pressure to 'expose' misinformation from every side of the ideological spectrum equally? What are the biggest red flags to spot fake news/propoganda?
Thanks for doing this btw!

Also, would you let me rebrand your social media presence? I hope you don't mind but it looks kinda awful
Here's my [old portfolio](http://creatrixcrew.com/portfolio2.php)

And our [New Website](http://wispstudios.com/Ver5) (under development) Thanks for doing this AMA!

- How does your team debunk false narratives? Do you have experts in the team or you rely on volunteers from social media?

- How are you able sustain and run your website?

- What was the biggest myth you have debunked till now?

- With the increase in paid news and propaganda in last few years, what are the biggest challenges you see in next LS elections of 2019? Greetings and massive respect for the one man army job that you're doing right now on the social media. It's something that the internet users in this current decade really need especially in an age of fake propaganda and equally fake news with click bait titles and images. Even I have been doing a little part on this field from my side by regularly debunking whatsapp forwards in groups and those on social media albeit on a small scale (only among my friends circle)

Whats the most funniest piece of hoax that you've ever come across, hoax which is too ridiculous to be true but something that everyone believes and forwards it on the social media? Hi, can you make video like John Oliver on multilevel/chain marketing? That shit is way too prevalent in India.

Edit: spelling 1) Where do you start researching a news when deciding whether it's fake or not?  

2) Do you think an average Indian has become more intelligent in dealing with fake news in the last couple of years?  

3) What is the most ridiculous fake news you have come across? Dude. You are doing great stuff. We need more people like you who do something on ground rather than moaning about it on Reddit and Quora and FB and twitter. 

I like your style of debunking just pure black and white fake news rather than the grey ones. This way it is only objective with negligible subjectivity. 


I believe by increasing your active user base, you can magnify the impact of slaying the fake news. What is your strategy in increasing the user count?

Also, not sure but your news should have a easy to obtain whatsapp format. That ways people can copy your content and share on groups.  Hello!

Was really happy working with you after of all the star tantrums I endured with the rest of the artists who played on that platform. I was also at the RAIT show many years ago where you(Ram) gave gaalis to the crowd and they quietened down and I was an instant fan, LOL! 

Cheers :D I loved Bandey, used to trip on that song around 10 years ago.  First of all a big Thank you Indian Ocean for creating awesome music. Your all albums especially Taandanu is amazing.
Lets start with
1) What's on your favourite bands of all times? 
2) can you guys suggest something good music similar to yours?
3) Next album when?  :D
    Rahul Ram, any plan on acting in another film after 1947 earth? how did you got that role?  I love the indian independent (and rock) scene but it's largely underground and the bands seem to disappear after a few years. Just a few examples, I loved Vaayu but they disbanded. Same story for Silk Route. There was also Channel V's launchpad and they produced some great stuff from bands such as The Superfuzz, Faridkot, Decibel and Bhayanak Maut. There is coverage and there is an audience.

What, in your opinion, seems to be going wrong? Is it simply that the audience is too small? or that the audience doesn't pay (i've been guilty of this). Or that indie music isn't quite in the mainstream yet?

On a related note, i quite liked the collaboration you guys did with Subha Mudgal on your new album. Got no question to ask. Just wanted to say that your concert made the mood for my first gf. So thanks for that. Hey, you guys! This question (which may appear a bit random), is for the both of you:

1. How prevelant, in your experience, is the use of marijuana (or other drugs) in the music industry? Does it actually (from first or second hand experience) enhance creativity, as is commonly believed?

2. Why has the indie music scene in India remained largely stagnant over the last 15 years, as against the stand-up comedy scene, which took roots in the mainstream quite recently and just took off? I would guess that some of your music could be described as protest music. As far as i know, there isn't a lot of protest music in india. I suppose this is because of the political situation and the fact that protest music could rub someone the wrong way and get you in trouble.

Your thoughts? Hello, total noob here in terms of music. From what musicians do you draw inspiration? Also, some of your own favourite songs that you had the most fun composing?  Would you like to invite Susmit Sen to come and jam with you at a show?  Alright guys, I'm off for the day. Thank you for the lovely questions and let's do this again sometime. Thanks, Reddit! 

Find us on Facebook and such like. Hopefully we'll play at a city near you soon.

Sure, some might argue that neem / tree branches were used in certain civilizations. Is there any way that human teeth are naturally capable to adapt to nature? Other than a hygiene standpoint, is brushing really necessary otherwise? Do you think diets might play a larger role to health of teeth? Less sugars, colors/spices, more calcium/protein?  Why are people in USA so particular about their teeth (both hygiene and appearance) while the British don't care (and are ridiculed in hollywood movies for bad teeth)?

* At what age, one should start flossing?

* If I don't breath bad or can not see the cavity formation or don't have any kind of pain should I visit the dentist for a regular checkup?

* Why rinsing your mouth every time you eat is not a popular practice in India?

I watched it on a whim, without reading any reviews (which were all glorious) on the first day and was mesmerised and blown away by the magic on screen. Terrific work by everyone involved in it. Udaan was another amazing movie And I look forward to every movie by Phantom. I just wanted to ask you how do you get into the thought process of the characters, how do they turn out to be so real.

Mr Rajkummar: I loved your work in Kai Po Che and Queen, your acting really shines despite it being an ensemble (in the former) and not being the central act (as in queen). Your characters have a sense of realism that makes them very relatable in the way they do the things they do. So it's the same question, how do you get that sense of realism in them.

To both of you, which are your favourite books, or which ones are you reading now, if any.

Best of luck for the movie, will definitely be watching it as the premise and the trailer are awesome.

Edited: typo To the both of you, metaphorically speaking; is there anything you feel you're 'Trapped' in? :P Mr. Motwane, I've seen lots of bad reviews of Lootera's DVD. Basically it looks like those illegal cam rips. Any chance of getting a bluray release?

Hearing your feedback is always useful to us and we take it seriously.  I'm impressed with the quality of questions and comments.  Thanks to the moderators as well for their help!",Chris-Daniels,AMA," Hello Mr Daniels, it's good to have you here to answer our questions. In no particular order of importance:

- Will Facebook remain ad-free forever on the Free Basics platform?

- Will you allow all websites on the platform if they are compliant with the spec-sheet, even if you think they are non-essential to the target demographic of Free Basics, like religious or political propaganda websites?

- Can you provide us complete assurance that you do absolutely no examination of web browsing patterns on the platform that are profitable for Facebook and/or its partners?

- How do you feel about your India Free Basics partner Reliance advertising the platform as a way of [""Accessing Facebook Without a data plan""](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3xbhrt/wtf_just_saw_this_facebook_ad_in_todays_hindi/)? 

- This question is about how the Free Basics platform works. Facebook has said that [carriers bear the bandwidth costs of the Free Basics platform](https://info.internet.org/en/top-10-facts-about-free-basics/). In that case, aside from developing the platform, what exactly is Facebook doing here? Does Facebook bear any financial cost whatsoever? (aside from advertising)

- Will the spec-sheet compliance appraisal be automated in the future? That is, will Facebook take steps to take itself out of the process of approving a website by completely making the process of checking whether an app or website complies with the spec sheet automatic? If not, why?

- Will the Free Basics platform gradually evolve to bring the entire internet online? Something along the lines of [GoogleWebLight](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6211428?hl=en) seem appropriate for this.

- Will the spec-sheet be gradually liberalized to include video as network infrastructure upgrades?

- Free Basics added the spec-sheet approval process to move the platform closer to net neutrality. Were all your carrier partners internationally unconditionally fine with this change?

- Has Free Basics faced similar legislative threats from other countries? How did you deal with those there? How many of the countries you operate in have any net neutrality guidelines at all?

- How easy do you think it would be for an indie developer to make their apps or websites compliant with the Free Basics platform? How time-consuming is the process of optimizing a website or app for Free Basics?

- Are you sending the messages from Facebook users to TRAI to advisorfea1@trai.gov.in? If so, why? The stock template for the comment in Facebook is not a response to the consultation paper, it's an emotional appeal.

- What do you think of the alternate proposal to have data limits instead of website/service limits? Is this an idea that you are against, or is it one that carriers oppose internationally? In either case, what are the reasons?

- Is Facebook not asking Net Neutrality supporters on Facebook to send a message to TRAI in their favor? I didn't get a single notification or prompt from Facebook about saving Free Basics, and neither did many supporters I know. And no notifications from my 600+ friends either. Is Facebook using profile data (including posts) to determine whether or not a user will be asked to save Free Basics?

- I'm going to repeat a question from the TRAI consultation paper. Do you approve of differential pricing for apps and websites? Free Basics is a platform, so it's not in the scope of this question. Currently in India, differential pricing for data is allowed in the form of [WhatsApp-only](http://www.airtel.in/whatsapp/?cid=social21491444) or [Facebook-only data plans](http://www.medianama.com/2014/06/223-bsnl-starts-offering-whatsapp-and-facebook-data-bundles/). Do you think this should be allowed?

- Do you believe all carriers can afford to partner with you, and the bandwidth costs you entail?

- Internet.org used to be have a few partnered sites selected by Facebook, and is now an open standard that anyone can join. Did this transformation happen in reaction to criticism by Net Neutrality activists in India?

- How long does Free Basics normally take to evaluate a submitted site/service/app? Hi Chris!
I am testing a beta app for my university which can provide VoIP services on slow networks. My aim is to make it nation-wide service capable of working on 2G speeds (rate = 256kbps). However As per Guidelines of Free Basics, VoIP services are not welcome. Why can I not publish an app/ website on free basics in spite of it being a light-loaded service?  Assuming everything about Free Basics is true as claimed by Facebook, why should India draft a policy looking at just one case of benevolent Zero Rating, while it's abundantly clear that most cases of Zero Rating are malicious? You can't let an individual case dictate policy. 1. What was the rationale for renaming internet.org to free basics? The change in technical specs didn't require a name change. Wasn't that just a PR exercise which coincided with heavy ad spending to mislead even critics into thinking this is something completely different?
2. You released a survey that said 9 out of 10 net neutrality supporters support free basics. Can you clarify what was the sample you took for this survey?
3. Facebook keeps saying it won't earn any profit from free basics. Won't a potential new user base going into the millions who start off thinking Facebook is a 'free basic' feature of the internet count as a source of potential profits?
4. If Facebook does not intend to profit from free basics directly or indirectly, how will you justify all the money spent on promoting it to your shareholders when they ask you why you keep spending money on a scheme that faces so much opposition?

Edit: Removed an analogy which wasn't widely known These are questions the members of Free Software Movement Karnataka have. 

1. If Free Basics allows access to only certain parts of the internet, how exactly does Facebook claim that it is in support of net neutrality? This very act of passive monopoly is quite the opposite of what the advocates of net neutrality believe.

1. What percentage of all web based services do they honestly see to be a part of Free Basics in about a year or so?

1. Facebook seems to claim that Free Basics is a charitable contribution to society, but activists have been opposing it for a long time and Facebook is actively fighting back. Why is Facebook spending so much money and effort on campaigning for something that people clearly do not want? If people don't want your ""charity"", why force it upon them? And what does that say about the true nature of Free Basics?

1. If providing connectivity is the goal of Free Basics, why is Facebook in control? Why not provide full Internet access instead (perhaps limited in speed and data usage)? Can Facebook explain why it needs to control (and potentially censor and spy on) users' Internet access for reasons other than its own financial gain?

1. It appears that Free Basics is a consumer connection which does not support creation of digital produce. How does FB feel about forcing people to become consumers?

1. How much has Facebook spent on advertisements and lobbying for Free Basics?

1. As an educationist I want my students to become creators rather than consumers as this will help the growth of the nation. Why is FB intent on forcing a technically substandard solution?

1. When you showed people a notification, asking them to support Free Basics, there wasn't a chance for the other side of the argument (activists, net neutrality etc.) to be heard, and hence the support provided by your users was just after hearing one side. Then how can you count that as unprecedented support? Aircel too is giving ['Free Basic Internet'](http://trak.in/tags/business/2015/10/16/aircel-free-basic-internet-net-neutral-free-fair-facebook/), which lets new users on their connection to access the internet under limited bandwidth(for all sites), but not limited websites. So Aircel is letting new users use 'free' internet as they wish, they can surf whatsoever website  they desire unlike 'Facebook's 'free basic' that only let's a handful websites to be used under Facebook's discrimination.

If Facebook really wants people who've never been on the internet before to show how it's like, why doesn't Facebook give them *free data* to surf whatsoever website they desire?  Why is Facebook causing a monopoly in their favor by letting only a handful websites be used by the user for free? This is an *evident* breach of Net-Neutrality, and saying that new start-ups can apply to be in Facebook's 'walled garden' doesn't change the fact that Facebook can play the role of 'Big Brother' and decide who gets on their Free Basics and who doesn‚Äôt. Doing this, Facebook and it's sisters sites on 'Free Basics' already have an unfair advantage. 

Facebook stood up **for** Net Neutrality in the U.S to the proposed 'fast lane and slow lane' . But openly violates it in over 33 countries and claims that this is different? Why and how is this different ? The only difference I see is that Facebook instead of trying to control speed like that of Comcast and AT&T(because Facebook isn't an ISP) is engaged in trying to control content.

Controlling Content, is a fundamental breach of Net Neutrality. 


        
 Dear Mr. Daniels, I had posted my questions [in the earlier thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3y3h1o/ama_announcement_chris_daniels_vice_president/cyabzsp) to give you and your team some time to procure the numbers.


*Question 1:* **How much money has been put into marketing your internet.org platform?** In-app notifications, polls, windows and sponsored FB posts count as marketing. More specifically, how much would it have cost a third party to advertise on the scale of ""free basics"" on Facebook? **How much of it was dedicated to the actual product development?** If Facebook stands to make no profit from this venture, why has the company made the said investment in marketing and development?


*Question 2:* If (big if) the motive was 100% charity, **what other ways were considered as worthy of charity?** Example: Microsoft's former CEO launched the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation to deal with issues in the developing world. Why would Zuck and other stakeholders not just do the same? Do you really think a farmer in Maharashtra can benefit more from joining Facebook groups than having access to high-yielding crop, equipment, and infrastructure?


*Question 3:* **What are your plans for making sure that the next billion internet users don't fall prey to the same mistakes that the first billion did?** Are there landing pages dedicated to educating them against common internet frauds and time-wasters? What's to say that they won't just end up sending a bunch of frandsheep requests to women and killing each other over online arguments? We both know that's happened many times in the past, and the fact that you're planning to introduce a largely un-initiated audience to this platform greatly increases such risks. **By how much has Facebook beefed up its moderation team to deal with foreseeable cases of severe online harassment?**

*Question 4:* Please take a few minutes to [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAQWsTFF0BM) and r**espond to concerns raised therein**. Looking forward to your side of the story on why VOIP was omitted. Please feel free to respond to other critical points mentioned in that video too.

*Feedback:* Your marketing for internet.org has been atrocious. Calling people who do not subscribe to your world view 'lobbyists' is akin to vilifying everyone who disagrees with you. That's how children argue! The whole over-aggressive, dare I say immature, marketing push has raised more eyebrows than eyeballs.

I appreciate your attention. Please take the time to do an AMA for more than an hour. This is a complicated and critical conversation, arbitrary limitations on communication will harm both our POVs. After all, having more and better communication is the point of the Internet (.org or otherwise).

I look forward to an extended, insightful conversation with you and the Reddit India community. These questions were raised with inputs from reddit users on the comment thread linked above.

Thanks again!

Edit: Grammar. In the recent past, you have blocked Telegram links on Whatsapp, a strange move. You have also done similar things in the past, banning competitors . Early today, ~~Facebook was warning people when they clicked on a SaveTheInternet link~~ (as /u/sainibhai points out, this is wrong). In fact, instead of educating people about your offering, you were trying to take advantage of people who want a digital India by getting them to send an e-mail, or say yes to a prompt, without even understanding what they were getting into.

There‚Äôs a clear precedent in your actions here. You‚Äôre a private business and you are going to uphold your own interests, which is fair. So, questions:

a) Why should you be the gatekeeper of the Internet for a huge percentage of Indians when you clearly have a poor history dealing with any kind of resistance?

b) How is it digital ‚Äúequality‚Äù when people are getting access to the a very, very tiny set of websites? They aren‚Äôt being connected to the marvel that is the Internet: they are getting access to a company ‚Äî and a few others, who get approved by that company ‚Äî that‚Äôs trying to find new ways to onboard users onto their platform and strengthen their hold on the market which, in itself, is very fair except for the misleading ads you‚Äôre putting up.

c) If your data says that 50% of the people who get Free Basics start paying for their data within 30 days, there surely has to be a much better way to advertise the Internet and its potential benefits to them, since that‚Äôs all they are lacking at the moment? Could the telecom operators not set up a 30 day free trial to all of the Internet after which those 50% would still start paying for their data unless there‚Äôs something off there?

I‚Äôm as eager for a digital India as anybody, but India can chart its own way, even if it‚Äôs slow in your view. We got a mobile phone in hands of pretty much every Indian within a decade. Internet will reach every Indian household too, and by the Internet, I mean the real Internet, where everyone has access to the same content ‚Äî digital ‚Äúequality‚Äù ‚Äî without a private business gatekeeping. You have partnered with RCom to deliver FreeBasics in India.

BUT all I see Rcom advertising only about the benefit of using Free Facebbok on their platform, no mention of other services. Don't you think the ulterior effects of FreeBasics is already becoming apparent.

Also, why Rcom, which has the one of the worst coverage inrural areas?

Facebook is running a huge campaign on its platform. How much this would have cost if some other user would like to run such a campaign on Facebook? I appreciate the fact that you are doing this AMA session.

My question to you is the following: 

There are quite a few options for providing free-of-cost internet access such as those provided by companies like [Gigato](http://www.digit.in/general/gigatos-toll-free-internet-28094.html), [Jana.com](http://www.thehindu.com/business/jana-is-in-full-support-of-net-neutrality/article7181486.ece) and [Mozilla](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/net-neutrality-mozilla-suggests-equal-rating/article7177532.ece). They basically earn advertising revenue and in exchange for viewing ads/apps/sponsored products users get access to the ENTIRE internet, and these plans are neutral towards all websites/apps/services on the internet. 

Why can't Facebook adopt a similar net neutral model for providing internet access? What is so special about Free Basics that Gigato, Jana and Mozilla models don't have?

Some more Net Neutral alternatives on this page: https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3l9y7t/net_neutrality_supporters_are_not_depriving_the/

-----

And a request to your team, kindly don't paint Net Neutrality supporters as anti-poor. It is a disingenuous attempt at deflecting the actual argument of importance of Net Neutrality. Thank you for doing this AMA Mr Daniels.

In your [petition to support free basics](http://imgur.com/ntgqneL) you have called its opponents, 'a small vocal group of critics'. Member of Parliament /u/tathagatasatpathy, who represents people from the Dhenkanal constituency, [has voiced support for net neutrality](https://www.docdroid.net/wqsc/dissent-letter-to-trai.pdf.html) and against free basics. Chief Minister of Odisha and Biju Janata Dal Party leader, Mr Naveen Patnaik, has [expressed support](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxVv9E1h36NGLWVNOVFYcUtScms/edit) on behalf of the whole Party, which includes all the elected MPs and MLAs. 

There were many other elected leaders who have similarly being *vocal* in their support for Net Neutrality.
Are you suggesting that elected people's representatives are a *small vocal group of critics*?", shadowbannedguy1 brushmeoff blue-orange ronan125 adityasaky None funkyhunky3000 ___0__0___ rdiaboli neutralWeb kumbhakaran
"I cook(though not professionally), will be happy to answer any of your questions regarding cooking to the best of my knowledge, so AMA.",143,5pa2zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5pa2zu/i_cookthough_not_professionally_will_be_happy_to/,174,1485023819.0,"Hey r/india, so cooking has been a passion of mine since I was a wee boy and have the scars to prove it(I remember it as clear as day, I must have been 10-11 there was a party at our house, mum was frying bhaturas and I was pestering her to let me fry one, so just to get rid of me she said yes, she instructed me as to how to go about it and was watching me like a hawk but me being a dumb-ass that I am plopped the bhatura in the hot oil instead of gently sliding it in, after that I only remember crying like a little bitch that I was as the welt formed on my chest where I got burned :D.)

Anyways even though I am an ""trying to be former"" omnivore(I know, it's complicated :D), I only cook vegetarian fare at home, as the wife would kick me out if I even suggested bringing home anything other than vegetarian. You can have a gander at some of the stuff I cooked here :

http://an8hu.imgur.com/

I think anyone can learn to cook and in this day and age everyone should cook, even if it's just the basic stuff, to be self reliant.

I don't proclaim to be the master on the subject matter, but I do consider myself to be experienced enough to answer your questions as I love to consume anything related to cooking, be it books, articles or videos.

So ask away.

Edit : (12:00am)

So I am off to bed, sorry if I missed any of your questions, I will try to get them in the morning.

Cheers",an8hu,AMA," What tips would you give to someone who knows nothing about cooking? Like I can make tea and ready made noodles, but how can I improve to making actual food?  > http://an8hu.imgur.com/    

Marry me!  **For Non Leafy Vegetables :**

4 Tablespoons of Oil (Ghee 2 Table Spoon)

1 Tea Spoon of Cumin seeds

1 Tea Spoon of Mustard seeds (for making Dal and some curries)

1 Chopped Onions

3 Chopped Green Chillies

Half a Tablespoon of Ginger paste and Garlic paste ( cook it for 30 seconds for the smell to go away)

1 chopped Tomato

1 Teaspoon of Turmeric powder

1 Tea spoon of Red Chilli powder

1 Tea spoon of Coriander powder

1 Tea Spoon of Cumin powder

2 Tea spoon of Masala of your Choice (Pav Bhaji,Mix Veg,Chole,etc etc)

Salt to Taste.1 Teaspoon of salt which looks like a small mountain is enough initially.Add a pinch of it if you still doubt it's less.

Half a cup of water for vegetables to boil.2 cups of water if you like gravy.Cook for 10 minutes in medium flame.Stir in between so that the vegetables do not get stick in the Wok or Kadhai.


**For Leafy Vegetables (Palak,Methi,Sarso,Chawli)**

2 Tables Spoon of Oil

1 Tea spoon Mustard seeds.

4 Pieces of Garlic chopped finely.

3 Green chillies.

Half Teaspoon of Red chilli powder ( optional)

1 Medium sized Tomato chopped ( optional)

1 teaspoon Salt to taste.

Sprinkle some water for leaf to melt faster.

Close the lid for 7 minutes.It is ready to eat.


These are pretty much the basics of making any vegetables or curries that is Indian.Just remember it on your mind and you will never be afraid.

Edit : Thanks OP for appreciating it.One thing I forgot to mention that the list is sequential,meaning that's the order you should follow while cooking any non leafy vegetables. For Leafy Vegetables I am adding separate sequence. 
 So list some good and healthy stuff which I can have for dinner daily and can prepare in <1 hr (eevrything included) [deleted] Many people who eat onion & garlic less dishes; use asafoetida in majority of their dishes. Do you think the use of asafoetida is primarily to compensate the strong, pungent and heated taste of onion & garlic? I've been cooking for the past six months and one thing I'm tired of is using the same tomato onion base for all the North Indian dishes. I don't want to do cashew and other bases that are fattening. Can you suggest some good alternatives. Do you think about the presentation aspect before even starting to cook or how does this work? I cook a few things really well and though the end product is tasty, it doesn't look good. I cook too. Am on a public computer, so can't post pictures right now. but I promise to upload pics.

My question is, How do you make your food look so good in the pics? Is it the lighting? The angle? the matching plates and cutlery? 

When I cook, it might taste amazing, but it looks like it was pulled out from a dump when i try to take pics of it. Any tips on presentation? 1. What's your #1 brand for spices? If you get them whole and ground them yourself, where do you buy them?

2. Khada masala (garam masala) goes in before or after adding chicken in curry?

3. Tomatoes go in before or after adding chicken/meat in curry?

4. Best way to get mutton to be succulent without cooking it in a pressure cooker before, or letting it cook for like a gazillion hours?

 I love your posts and I want to see more of it.

I'm 20 and I can cook basic things (like make sandwiches, pasta, noodles etc.) but I've never tried my hand at bigger things (Pizza, Curries, Cakes, etc.) Where do I start and what tips would you like to give?", kaoticreapz None DeeliciouslyMali avinassh None ThrowAwayGilgamesh Froogler foknichya_leader Thisisbhusha None xEpic

Do you have to face any stigma in society of not being a real doctor? You know...... what I mean. No offence..  

Are there any future plans to make ayurveda standardised and conduct double blind trials? 

I have heard ayurveda talks about ghosts making you sick. Ture or false...... 

Can you get MD MS as after mbbs? MSc or any other modern degree.  

Are you guys making innovations or using Same old references. How do you classify newly introduced fruits and vegs like kale, avocado and so...... 

My grandfather didn't take any therapy for cancer and only took ayurveda doctor's medicines. He died... üòü why do these people claim to cure disease which can't be cured by ayurveda or are there any references to it?

 What is your opinion on actors and actresses promoting fairness creams? There is a great misunderstanding with Indian people and in general in the world about women's rights or LGBTQ rights. Even I was biased and felt that Gay is wrong, and all women are treated equal. It was only when I hear from other women or people from LGBTQ whom I knew, I could understand the sentiment.

2.**What can each individual do, in his capacity, to help this?**

I never know what to do in these cases; met Emilia Clarke and she was just amazing and we talked for a couple of hours about random stuff, met Brock Lesnar and he seemed like he wanted to be left alone so I just slept and woke up with my head on his shoulder.

I loved Margarita with a Straw, though I have my critiques, but it was very nice to see a different cinema emerging from Bollywood. Keep up the good work! :)

Here's my questions : 


**1) What do you see the future of LGBT rights and activism in India, considering the current political atmosphere?**


**2) In the mainstream cinema, though it's good to see homosexuality being discussed, but what I often feel is the T in LGBT is never discussed. What are you doing (or planning) for the Transgenders and their empowerment.**


**3) As someone from design and film industry, I feel that the film is a powerful medium. Do you think, Bollywood with it present influence, is not being utilized to tackle real issues, and is playing safe?**

3) When you're watching a movie, how do you know it's well directed?

4) How do actors handle themselves during sex/intimate scenes?

5) Some movies require simulated violent, degenerate, traumatic, and repulsive acts, a role that is extremely arduous emotionally. Hows does this affect actors in their personal lives?

I am Sandeep Goenka, co-founder of Zebpay, an app-enabled bitcoin wallet and exchange.

**About Bitcoin**

Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system. It is commonly called a decentralized digital currency. It was invented in 2009. It is an open source software. This means, that no person, company or country owns this network just like no one owns the Internet. The system is peer-to-peer, that is, users can transact directly without an intermediary like a bank, a credit card company or a clearing house. Transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain. 

Short explanation on what is bitcoin: https://youtu.be/jiEllBFNaMA

A longer version - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmU28mgihB4

**About Zebpay & Sandeep Goenka**

Zebpay is a bitcoin app available for Android and iPhones. It is the most popular bitcoin exchange in India. Users can buy / sell bitcoins, top up airtime and buy vouchers of Flipkart, Amazon and more. Zebpay is the first in the industry to launch bitcoin wallet app that enables bitcoin transactions using a mobile number without any complexities to understand bitcoin addresses, taking backups or fear of losing bitcoins. 

In just a year, Zebpay app has clocked 150,000 downloads and crossed a turnover of Rs 450 crores. After early adopters, bitcoins are attracting a new class of users like young professionals and HNIs. Users are now using bitcoin as an alternative investment. They are also using it for online shopping, airtime top up, paying bills and buying gift vouchers. We believe India will see an explosion of digital assets like bitcoins in next 2 years. Zebpay is on a mission to spread digital assets and bitcoins in India.

Edit: Hi everyone! I am live now for the AMA.
--------------------------------------

Edit:
Thank you guys for participating. You can continue to post questions and I will respond to them tomorrow.

Edit: 
I will keep monitoring this post and will reply if there are any more questions. Thanks once again for the additional questions.",goenkasandeep,AMA," Regarding bitcoins in India, who's to stop me from thinking that your company would not run away with my money? How do you build that trust in a user, that bitcoins are safe and my money is secure? Do you agree that a possible mainstream success of Bitcoin would be it's death?

Power to print currency (or to withdraw) is one of the key reasons for the existence of Governments other than taxing people and waging wars. Why would a Government let that power go away?

I am not talking about morality but the practical aspect. 

If however it remains on margin and doesn't become mainstream the volatility will remain high and reduce the usage over time, even for the specialised purposes it facilitates.  Btw, if you click 'give gold' on any comment, you'll see an option to pay using bitcoin :). Hi, 

Seeing that no one is here yet, Ill go first. I actually saw this question over at r/IndiaInvestments .

Why is there such a huge gap between the bitcoin buying price in the US and in India ? For ex. if I buy from Coinbase, it's $739 right now, but if I buy/sell from Zebpay its $ 920 (roughly)

Also, is it possible to actually use this opportunity to make gains from arbitrage ?  So far RBI has no plans for regulating Bitcoin. Considering the present situation if more people hop on to bitcoin do you think RBI will resort to ban? 

How do you manage ED and FEMA?  Hello Sandeep, Thanks for doing this AMA, what steps should an average trader in India take to ensure the legality of their bitcoin trading. As I understand, in 2013 ED raided a few traders for violating FEMA while the same practices are knowingly or unknowingly still being followed by traders and even companies in India.  How reliable are bitcoins? If I invest X amount today what's stopping it from becoming 0 tomorrow? Hello Sandeep, one more question I had was what security steps does your company make to ensure the exchange from getting hacked. Moreover, do you keep any of your bitcoins in cold storage?  Hi there,

I am seeing a huge premium on Indian exchanges compared to USD/EUR or even CNY exchanges. Could you give us a rough number of what turnover (or BTC volume) per day you are seeing at the moment? Also, where do you source your bitcoins from (other exchanges, directly from miners?)?
Following the demonetization measures, what kind of surge have you seen in user numbers?

Thanks and great seeing bitcoin having an impact in India! Thanks Sandeep for AMA. Who are using bitcoin in India? Which merchants prominently ? Why do you think bitcoin will suceed in India where even card reader penetration is still low? How can you explain virtual currency to merchants in India ? I feel like this might be an appropriate place to post this. The RemindMe bot just reminded me of a comment I made a year ago:

- What kind of spooky shit do you see while flying that passengers can't, and are you prevented from talking about it?  
- Do pilots get access to cool parts of the airport that us civvies don't?  Honest answer please, do you know what ALL the buttons do? About a decade back, I used to fly a lot domestically(passenger of course) in the South through Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Louisville - the one thing that struck me about the crew in the south was that while they greet nearly all whites they tended to lose eye contact or lower their voice when this brown man(me) boarded. Of course I would look up from my book and say an extra-loud ""GOOD EVENING"" as I walked into the plane :)

It was a different experience around West Coast as the flight attendants were gregarious and fun. Do you still have a lot of racially stuck-up attendants in the South?

It was more on domestic airlines. The Mumbai-Atlanta Delta Flight for example typically had friendly attendants, perhaps they thought only the richer Indians travel internationally. But Atlanta-Cincinnati? Every attendant had her Snootypant on. This is one of the best AMA thread in recent times, very informative. I would like to say I envy your job and thank you very much for doing this AMA Haven't ever seen an AMA with iceman's enthusiasm and thoroughness. Thank you! Please rate the domestic airlines in India as per your judgements with regards to their safety and performance. Always wanted to be a pilot, glad to see your AMA.

Couple of questions:

1. Irrespective of the flying hours you have, do you still get nervous  or feel an adrenaline rush when approaching under heavy turbulence? I recall a JAI flight, in a 77W, to EBBR under heavy turbulence all the way from descent to wheels down and even the most seasoned travelers in the cabin seemed to be very perturbed. 

2. Do you fly as a hobby ever? Soaring or gliding? 

3. Any opinions on Sully (the movie)? I ask because I feel like the incident is easily glorified-- as respectable as Captain Sully's and the crew's actions were, I think that the situation is exactly what the training is for and focusing on one act of brilliant competence doesn't do justice to the professionalism and competence of the thousands of pilots and cabin crew who take care of us everyday. 

4. This is more of a very selfish comment and not really a question. One thing I really hate about the a*holes who hijacked the planes on 9/11 is that it forever changed cockpit entry regulations and I don't think I will ever get to see the cockpit at FL400. Unless I charter my own Learjet, but that's going to have to wait for a bit. I hope you enjoy the views you get to see from the best office in the world.

Filmmaker, New Media Entrepreneur, ",theqtiyapaguy,AMA," Is it true you guys had about Rs. 50L budget for every episode of Pitchers? How true is the rivalry with AIB? Question yeh hai ki does pitchers deserve to be in the top 50 TV shows of all time on IMDB? 
Not hating, loved the show, just curious to know your opinion. How do you choose the more experienced actors for the show? Like the actor who played Tanya's dad in Permanent Roommates (One of my favorite characters). Do they audition or do you guys approach them? Have you ever been rejected by an experienced actor because of how different you are from mainstream TV shows? Has the attitude changed after the success? WTF just happened here dude? you have obviously hired a PR firm to make this AMA a ""success"", and let me tell you straight away, they did a horrible job of blending in with the natural crowd. Just look at the number of new fucking accounts, or ones with 0 karma asking the most retarded questions possible.

The real tragedy is you didn't even have to do this AT ALL. /r/india loved Pitchers afaik and people would have enjoyed the AMA session with you, especially without this blatant shilling. 

Utterly pathetic and unexpected from a group of people who are revolutionizing the whole entertainment industry in India.

*PS: you might wanna stop any payments to this PR firm, this was a failed job, or so you'll see in a few days.*

**EDIT:** Someone pointed out that I should wait for real story to ""come out"" before making allegations. This is Reddit, nothing is going to ""come out"", and there is no judiciary apart from admins, who from my experience, are not going to take interest in this (they haven't replied). Moreover, I'm commenting here as a user, and not a mod.
 Dude, don't come on TV, because of the fucking fact that you'll not be able to abuse like you do on YouTube, do your thing and God damn! you're comic timing, dope. 

Pitchers is turning heads in the television industry, good luck. 

PS. When are you returning?  No, Guys, I am not Married... abhi toh bachcha hoon yaar main.. 
Ragging Lene ki umar hai meri :)  Well somebody HAS to ask this.
Did Pitchers derive ANY inspiration from Silicon Valley (the TV show of course)? And are people asking you this question lately?  * What did your family said initially , was it received well ?

* You have a large team , how do handle the finances , is your advt. model going on well ?

* When are you coming to TV or rather what's next apart from youtube , if there is anything at all 

Good Luck man , you are doing excellent work . Also do tell Jeetu , to convey my love to Bhabhi - she is goddess :)  Chacha will be BACK for sURE..  1)Do you feel that TVF Content is sometimes excessively geared towards the 'ex Engineering-Management students' group of internet users? like even Pitchers had a lot of references/jokes to the characters hostel life etc. which would be easier for Engineering/Management grads to 'get'  
2) Do you ever want to make something 'darker'? like something which challenges your audience and tries to broaden their horizons? like dealing with topics such as homosexuality, crime, religious violence etc.? or do you wish to stay where you are in terms of ideas/content?

Can you provide some discount??? Hey Ravi. Did your course in 2013. Cracked both CAT and XAT. Passed out of a top 5 last year. Thanks.  Why are you doing a AMA?  Do you think there's any scope for online education in India where the courses are not for competitive exams (like CAT, JEE) but general education (say teaching Calculus)? [deleted] What tools do you think are missing for online teachers or students? First of all thanks for doing this AMA. My questions to you are:

1. How do I know whether MBA is the thing for me? Do you have some kind of diagnostic or something to know whether I have an aptitude for finance or consulting etc. I don't want to get stuck in a field that I have no interest in.

2. I saw someone post their scores which according to me were pretty decent but you said ABC are ruled out. I scored 95 in Xth, 89.4 in XIIth and somewhere around 63-64 in undergrad (law school). Are ABC ruled out for me.

3. Once you get into B-school how much will I be discriminated against, given that I have no background traditional MBA fields? So when companies come to campus, will they not say that want to invest in someone who has 2 years work experience in the same field rather than me? How rampant is this?
Also, on a tangent, I am currently in one of India's best law schools. Does that have an effect on my application to get into B-school and does that add any value to companies when they come recruiting?

4. Do you have some sort of aptitude test on the basis of which you give discounts? Most of the GEMs even after scoring high percentile havent received any calls from old IIMs. What is your honest opinion regarding this? Any advice for GEMs taking this examination in future. Thanks in advance.' Does piracy hurt you? My dream company is coming for campus placement around end of march. The aptitude test is modeled after CAT (QA/VA/DI/LR) is what I've learnt from seniors.

So I guess my question is, how do I prepare for CAT in 60 days?

I will answer them if I get time.",Monsultant,AMA," [removed] What exactly does a Management consultant do? I've been on both sides, consulting as well as corporate.

My feel is that the greatest value the consultant adds is to help internally sell a solution/strategy within the client company. Most of the answers to a company's problems are known by the employees, but it takes an outside person to put together and synthesize clearly how to go about it, and in the process convince the internal stakeholders on the solution.

What's your take on this? What are some of your strategies that failed and ended up being counter productive in your experience or generally? What are some happy accident strategies ( as in should not have worked but did or worked for completely different reasons than though ) that you have seen or been a part of? What is your motivation to pursue this line of work? And are you happy doing what you do? I ask because I have close family who are into your line of work and the quality of their lifestyle is horrible to say the least. I know the paycheck is an attractive component of this line of work, but personally do you think the hours of work you put in is worth it in the end?

            We'll try to answer some more questions tomorrow. Goodnight :)",ISROredditors,AMA," What's the best part about working at ISRO? Glad to have you back!

1. What is the significance of Space Policy under works?

2. Assuming increase in demand for space missions that are strategic in nature, how does ISRO intends to defend its civilian status?

3. Is RESPOND program delivering as expected?

4. Is the progress of third launch facility dependent upon decision on human spaceflight program and hence on slow/uncertain path?

5. Any underrated things/projects that people need to be more aware of?

6. A silly one perhaps but what is purpose of that huge yellow crane on top of Umbilical Tower of SLP ? I have never seen it in action!

7. (sneaked in another one) Recently a rather large piece of space debris cataloged as WT1190F reentered and landed about 100km off Sri Lankan coast. Was there any attempt to observe this by any Indian agency? Surprisingly space agency from UAE flew an airplane down here and documented it!

Apart from constant stream of good news, this year was special with ISRO publishing some in depth content about its history. And it seems they are testing out Youtube too which would be great for engaging public but I must say these unofficial casual exchanges over social media are the best.

Please send a probe to Venus Akatsuki needs company! And more full discs of Mars please! Thanks :) How much ISRO contributes to Open Source? [NASA](https://github.com/nasa) is very active and does lots of amazing OSS contributions.  What are your views on the recent achievement by SpaceX? How is it being seen at ISRO? Hello! Thanks for doing this AMA today. I've been reading the book ""From Fishing Hamlet to Red Planet"", and I feel really proud of the work done by ISRO over the decades. Can't wait to buy the hard-copy.

My questions are:

* RLV-TD. Will we be able to see the developmental flight in 2016? If, yes? Then what's next for RLV-TD after the developmental flight is done?

* What else ISRO is doing to increase the number of commercial launches per year? This year we saw 2 of them. How much will this number increase?

* Is the current government supportive about the human spaceflight program? What all studies are being done to achieve it?

* How does ISRO plans to upgrade the current launchers? Any timeline for that? Any details you can share?

* If ISRO does plan to upgrade launchers, is re-usability been considered? 

* Do you guys think that it's high time the government increase ISRO's funding? 

* Why doesn't ISRO make official patches for missions? 

* Do you guys play Kerbal Space Program?

Lastly, this is just a suggestion. I would like ISRO to be more active on social media, maybe an official YouTube channel for explaining specific missions, other scientific observations and all. That's it. 
Once again, thanks for doing this. We are proud of you!

Edit: Some more questions if you guys don't mind. 

* What about the mission to Venus? 

* Does ISRO plan to have an exploration mission beyond the asteroid belt? Any studies being done on that? 

* We know ISRO and NASA are doing a mission together; NISAR. What other future collaborations with other space agencies are being talked about?

* Does ISRO encourages private space companies in India? Will that require policy change?

And on completely different note and please don't mind me mentioning this right now but since the AMA is happening now, why does it happen that the formatting on slides, pictures, articles is so bad? Images from MOM are also edited with poor highlighted text. Please fix that. 
 What can a common man do to help Isro? Hi, I am a NRI PhD (CS) working in performance optimization, performance analysis of OS and applications - at nanosecond scale. Some of our work has been applied by previous students in stock exchanges due to their high frequency nature. Are there opportunities for me in ISRO? What would be the procedure to get in?

I would return to India only for ISRO. I have no attachments to any nation, land, corporate or money. I would come only for work, science and my personal interest in space research. Is it worth it? Is my profile required in some field there? This AMA is verified.  Whats a typical day for a programmer/software engineer/coder in ISRO?  How is procurement policy in ISRO.
we DRDO scientist have bigger challenge of procurement of items/hardwares than actual technology.
We struggle to procure components and govt. procurement policy is everyday becoming stringnent despite it is for the govt. , nation and society we are working.

1. There seems to be complete radio silence on the Nag program ever since Ajai reported [target acquisition issues](http://ajaishukla.blogspot.com/2012/07/indian-army-and-drdo-co-operate-to.html) in 2012. Is the missile ever going into production, or is it effectively dead?

2. Some news outlets report that the MiG-29K has been a rather poor performer, and that the Navy isn't very happy with it. They say the avionics don't perform as well as advertised, the structure was found to be too weak for repeated carrier landings, and then there was also the CAG report that pointed to atrocious serviceability levels. What's your take? Is this all true or exaggerated?

3. You have been asked to bet the ungodly sum of [Rs. 100](http://imgur.com/W7ATlMi) on the outcome of the single engine fighter competition. Which one would you bet on, and why?

2. The road beyond Manali was quite dangerous and I was told it was open only during a few months. How was the journey for your family in particular and other families in general?
3. You seem very calm and thorough in your answer. I appreciate that. My main question is if you understood the weight of the situation at the time you were driven out? When it sinked in, how did you cope with that harsh reality?
4. Some day, you probably will have to tell your own kids or the kids in your family about all this. What are your thoughts on what you want to tell them, and more importantly, how do you want this whole issue understood by them?
5. Off topic, what are your thoughts on /r/india as a community?

* How did you find beginner-level projects to contribute to? I'm really of the opinion that I'll never learn something unless I try it out so I'd love to find some simple projects to work on. 

* I'm proficient in the usual engineering college syllabus programs (C, C++, HTML..). I've also put in numerous hours in CSS and web design in general. I learnt Java, however haven't touched any libraries yet. I'm also getting started on working with the MEAN stack.

I do have a lot of time kill and thought your advice will be helpful in taking what sort of approach I should carry on so that i could shape my career. I am good in web, Java and stuffs like that. Also I am quick to learn new things and technologies.


Edit: Currently I kill time on hakerrank and sites like audacity. But I am not sure how useful that is going to be. I am working in a IT company as a deployment guy. On H1B. Its been three years since my graduation (2013 batch) and I always wanted to do something really good. But after joining this company I never had any good reason to quit apart from the reason that the regular IT work being boring. Initial pay was ok and I was promoted fairly well and this US opportunity came knocking much earlier than I expected. From outside perspective, it looks like I am doing good but I am always worried about my future considering the nature of my work. Okay enough of my rant. 


My question is that, in my daily work there is no amount of programming involved. With my own interest I did some small automation using PowerShell and sometimes MS BI stack and C#. My knowledge is fairly limited to Microsoft Stack. And because of my skillset, there are not much open source projects to practice on. So if I choose to leave my job here in US and come back to India to join any small product based company(no matter what stack they use) even as an intern(I am very much willing to do that), do I even have a chance ?

About COBRA : CoBRA is a specialized unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) of India proficient in guerrilla tactics and jungle warfare. Originally established to counter the Naxalite problem, CoBRA is deployed to address any insurgent group engaging in asymmetrical warfare. Currently numbering ten battalions, CoBRA is ranked among one of India's more experienced and successful law enforcement units. 

About CRPF, which is my parent organisation : The Central Reserve Police Force is the largest of India's Central Armed Police Forces. It functions under the aegis of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) of the Government of India. The CRPF's primary role lies in assisting the State/Union Territories in police operations to maintain law and order and counter insurgency.

Feel free to ask about the training regimes in making of a special force officer, weapons and any other stuff. Kindly refrain from asking questions which are too political/ controversial/sensitive in nature as I will not be able to answer. I hope the good folks of r/india can understand that.

How do you and your colleagues in COBRA and CRPF take the criticism. 

While you all risk and even lose your life securing the country and fighting insurgents/millitants/terrorists, many of our country men support the Naxalites and millitants overtly and covertly through deeds and words. Many even criticise CRPF and the men.

Always #LookUp",rahul_housing,AMA," Hey Rahul, Just wanted to know your opinion on Myntra going app only and shutting down their website. Do you think its a wise decision and why? Would you recommend new startups to focus more on their site or app? Hi Rahul

Why do you claim to have beaten Common Floor and Magicbricks based on site visits and app downloads?  Aren't they bullshit metrics?  ""In IIT, I was surrounded by very smart people, but when I got out into the real world, I realised the density of smart people is not very high"", courtesy NDTV.com. Can you enlighten me  more about it? Hi Rahul, many thanks for doing this AMA.

My question : **What are the 3 most important things that contribute towards a startups' success in the Indian startup ecosystem?**

Please be as candid as possible. Hey Rahul, a dev  here. What are you doing about the high attrition rate at Housing? I know of 4 colleagues who joined Housing  in the beginning of this year who left Housing after a couple of months . I regularly hear from my colleagues that they have an offer from Housing but they are passing on it. All of them complain about the work not being intellectually challenging enough. 

P.S. Could you please maintain a proper registry of people who you have contacted as possible candidates , and not call them again and again. I cant remember a week where I did not get 4 or 5 calls asking me to appear for interviews at Housing.
 You've mentioned that there are very few Indian start-ups that have  your respect. Which are a few of these? Indica or Sativa? What is your opinion about Deepinder Goyal and Zomato?  What was the deal with Sequoia Capital? For science, Can you tell us what 'other bad things' were you referring to in your email to the VC? What made you ask Bhavish of Ola and Deepinder of Zomato to ask them to allot half of their shares to employees 1. Do you think Indians don't take risks and more and more people should start following their ideas and take the plung into being an entrepreneur? I ask this because the ratio of indian startups to people graduating from Indian colleges is skewed in a pretty bad way.

2. As a new startup, what were the major problems you faced?

3. What should the govt be doing to ease these bottlenecks?

4. Your group was full of IITians and I believe that your idea got better coverage and funding. If the same idea was  started by a group of non-iitians, would you believe that they also could have got funding the same way as you did? I mean without the IIT brand?", vendetta_315 redweddingsareawesom ashleycar bamboo12345 throwaway_housing None getvinay woccamrazor iHEx4Sex optymistik 5gr

The walk is a project of the Veditum India Foundation, and is being undertaken independently by me. A team from our production partner Digital Nerve comprising of Ayan Sil and Rahul Mitra are filming a documentary and capturing photographs. Ardra Venugopal, a Veditum fellow is working on cross sector research in relation to the river and the people living alongside it. We are recording real life experiences of people and the vivid sounds of nature, documenting success stories and that of distress related to the river, collecting social & scientific data and bringing out a first person narrative of the river as a co-living entity, if not the protagonist that it is. The idea is to use research in vivid ways to capture the attention of the audience and speak to them of the state of affairs, not just qualitatively but quantitatively as well. The project provides a platform to collect data for environmental research being conducted across the nation in various institutes.

I also walked 700kms across Rajasthan, highlighting the cause of Shekhawati Architecture and trying to understand Micro Lending issues in this region as well. Through these endeavours, we could raise both funds and awareness for the mentioned causes, translating directly into impact at many fronts.

Wishing you all the best for the journey!! Hi Siddharth

Glad to see your AMA. some questions below
How has been the response of people you meet along the way? What do they think about your endeavor?

Can you detail the impact if your cycling and walking projects?

Is the impact more secondary ( raising awareness online or offline via media ) or more primary ( direct meeting with people )?

I remember that you had to call off some part of the Rajasthan expedition due to an injury. Precautions for this one?
 This may sound a little crass, but I'm really interested in how you raised funding for such a project.  Any challenges/threats/dangers you've faced so far, be it from the locals or the wildlife or the terrain? Good to see more people doing it my father also did he started at gangotri walked all the way to ganga sagar..good luck to your journey 1. In you journey so far, have there been visible signs of increase in pollution in the river after a particular city or area and similarly visible signs of recovery by the river?

2. As far as I remember, when the crowd funding campaign ended, you weren't able to meet the financial target. How are you and your team coping with this deficit? And are there any plans to have another campaign?

3. Have you been listening to music while walking? Can you share the playlist? :P

4. Have there been any technical challenges that you or the team have faced while filming?

nice name Hi Pranaav, Thanks so much for doing this AMA. First of all, huge respect for sportspersons like you representing our country. I have been following Indian badminton for quite some time now. Few questions:

1. Although we have had considerable success with singles players like Saina, Sidhu and Srikanth, we haven't been able to replicate that success with the doubles. What do you think is the reason?

2. When you guys travel abroad, is there a difference in how the association treats the players. For e.g. Sindhu or Saina might be travelling in business class and others in economy?

3. I know Saina has a separate coach, does she also travel with a separate set of support staff than the ones provided by BAI. Like physio, trainers and so on? Is their travel also provided for by BAI?

4. How do you see the new crop of badminton players coming up? Do you think we will find another Saina?

5. How much do you earn per year? You don't have to answer this if you don't feel like. Thank you so much guys!

Have your life ever been threatened because of the line of work? How do you deal with such instances knowing that the state machinery if fully in the pockets of the corrupt few? I was going through azadi.in. Its been more than 10 days and I can only see 3 % funding it.

* What kind of police reforms do you see happening in India?
* Do you really believe that 3 lakh crores were saved? Because unless all allocations were faulty, that 3 lakhs crores does not make sense. Also if some of the allocations were faulty, was it right to cancel all allocations? What are your views on Subramaniam Swamy ? So you guys are going to take the government to court for doing a bad job implementing the law? That's such a hopeful prospect. Is there a deadline on how long you will wait before you begin legal proceedings? BTW thank you for doing this AMA. 

 Thank you for doing this AMA. 
1. Is there a deadline on how long till you start with legal proceedings? 
2. How has the Modi effect been on bureaucracy in your opinion?  Thanks for doing this. I really admire your group. Contributed! Hope you'll reach your goal.

My question: What motivated you to do what you do? Have you ever felt tired fighting corruption, bureaucracy, crony capitalism and apathy. 

Edit Follow up: What do you have to say youngster you feel tired and apathy towards these corruptions?.  You talk about the 2G scam but you do realise that such a policy is counter intuitive? That its far better to give spectrum away for a lower price ,or as some countries do - for free. Rather than trying to maximise government coffers? Do you believe that telecom companies are socialist government run enterprises? Every time you guys try maximise government coffers you end just passing on the cost as a tax to the consumer. Every cost gets built into the price.

Do you understand the basic concept that governments are supposed to maximise welfare not revenue?  And before you say anything that's what's happened as an eventuality of your PIL.

You guys set a precedent in the 2G case that is now costing consumers a lot of money for 3G data etc etc. In other countries spectrum goes for a lot lower price or its free. Indian cost  data is out of control. Not only that the cost of amortizing spectrum crowded out investment.

It's far better for governments to use give away spectrum for free; which frees up capital to invest in networks, and to negotiate down price. Thats how every mature economy deals with spectrum.

Not only that the high cost of spectrum acts as a barrier to entry for competition only for the market to turn into a oligopoly. 

Laywers should not be involved in public policy as far as I am concerned.  While A Raja did help out his friends during auctions and should have been jailed, your lawsuit has had unintended consequences or intended consequences.  Hello. Thanks for this AMA session.

it is one of the best of you guys :) The Permanent Room mates season -2 is way too dramatic than the first one. The original flavour of realistic and relatable content is somehow fading.

I have seen some episodes of Daaru pe charcha (not sure if it is from tvf) and it seems pretty promising.  Love your creativity, big fan of pitchers.

What are your plans with TVF Play , will we see more series /movies this year  Hi Biswa: Love TVF and love your work with the Arnub sketches.

I have a lot of original character sketches of lower-middle class life in chawl (old Bombay) -- very unique characters, their crazy quirks, too many neighbors, the whole 9-yards of too many people living in too tight a space. Right from the homeless bum to car-washer to the weekly once 4pm Thursday beggar. Very funny, unique and interesting life that comes with 'roz kuaan khodo roz pani piyo' kind of existence. I think, but I'm not sure, that it would make into a fine miniseries. Or maybe I can develop a slice of it into a short film to prove the promise it holds. Some of these characters & their quirks can also be drawn upon or refashioned into recurring side-characters in other existing shows. (think Susie The ""four-eyed fuck"" Essman from Curb Your Enthusiasm, wife of Larry David's agent who despises LD)

The target market for this story/sketch is everyone south of Bandra and many slums/chawl/matchbox hsg spread all across Bombay. Think Byculla, Parel, Lalbaug, Kalbadevi, Bhendi Bazar. Ofcourse other cities too have their own equivalents. I'm just listing what I've lived first hand.

* a) What is your suggestion for a first-timer like me to develop it into a coherent story? I mean I have all these characters but I don't know what story I should be telling through them. 
* b) What should be my approach to developing it further? 
* c) How strictly is 3-act structure or its variants followed in writing/filming?
* d) Can I walk in with few pages of sketch (I haven't written it yet, all visceral memory, but yes I can write it down) for say N of these characters -- their defining credo, unique lines etc, to your offices and just shoot the shit with some of you guys? I would love to do it. I really think you guys will grok the concept/idea and we can take it further as we see it. 15-min tops I need. If you don't like the idea, I'm out. We can even discuss over phone before you guys take a decision if you wanna meet me.

I'm so excited about it that I created a reddit ID just to get into this AMA. Came across your AMA notice from twitter.

Thanks for your time and Godspeed with all the new initiatives and direction TVF is getting into. When will kanan and the other Biswa get back together for pretentious movie reviews. What will it take to get them back together?

I have a couple of questions for you this evening - 

1. What are your thoughts on the mainstream babas all around 

2. Why do you think people are so dependent on any Babas and such ..

3. Do you think India will ever be free from all the psuedo-scientific & religious nonsense (including superstition) 

Thanks for doing the AMA ! Mr. Balendu why do you still use the title **SWAMI**? Dont you think it is misleading? If you have to propagate atheism why mislead innocent people to come and hear you in garb of being a swami. We already know that naive hindus will even brace *yeshu* as an idol in form of lord Ganesha or God Vishnu. We have seen it time and again in low hdi and illiterate and tribal population of India. Why not go with only your name and shed the garb of being a Swami?

I know I am late in this ama but I would really like to understand the psychology behind this farce. I hope you answer this. Greetings Swami Balendu,

Here are my questions -

(1) How did you transition to atheism? [I think most people in this thread would be wondering about this, so an elaborate answer would be highly appreciated.]

(2) What are some good books critiquing Hinduism?

(3) Do you see religion as evil? Is religion holding India back from progressing?

(4) Do you think religion, pseudo-science etc. can ever be eradicated from the Indian population?

(5) What would be your advice to average atheist citizens like me? Is there any way we can contribute in promoting atheism and scientific temperament in India?

Thank You. Pardon my offensive question: 

What about 'number 1' & 'number 2' in the cave? You guys are all stupid to listen to this. You will listen to someone who turned atheist from being a ""Spiritual Guru"" and not to someone who has been an atheist all his life. Such hypocrites we Indians are.

Here is a link to my book: https://www.amazon.in/dp/B06XK1HF4T Do read and share your reviews!",Shashank_AMA,AMA," 1. Can you give me 3 reasons why I should read your book?

2. How was writing your book like? Did you at some point want to give up? Thanks for doing this AMA.

How difficult (or easy?) is it to look for Indian history archives? Or how do you even begin to validate your theories or look for sources? 

It would seem that we have not been very good at documenting our history compared to some other countries. Most of the literary works from a few centuries ago seems to be good examples for eulogy and it becomes difficult to separate fact from fiction. On top of that, the form of language used has evolved quite drastically making it difficult to understand for someone with a modern day understanding of the language. Are you familiar with Brandon Sanderson's laws for creating magical systems?

Also, can a fresher contribute to your project remotely? No clue how I missed this thread. I don't typically look for AMAs, but I'm glad this will be an exception. I feel like the author is hyperqualified, so it'll be hard to think of  questions that won't come off as a dumb to him.. Nevertheless, I'll give it a shot. 

1. Why do you think so many authors are focusing on the pre-partition history but always *post*-British invasion? Is it just because records are better from that period? Is it recency bias? Or is it just the fact that it's what most people are interested in?

2. How do you view the debate on language? I'm thinking of those who say that English is '[destroying](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/how-english-ruined-indian-literature.html)' the Indian languages. 

3. I'm interesting about your journey from fiction to setting up an AI-focused NGO. More so the mental/intellectual journey than the actual (practical) steps. Did you start out as an engineer and then moved into humanities and you're only returning? Or the other way around? I'm asking because one thing I see in India is an overemphasis (in my view) on STEM and a dismissive view of humanities. Someone getting a humanities degree is seen as dumb and/or ""not serious"". Do you share this concern and if so, what do you think can be done to reverse it? I'm not a humanities major myself, and I have little interest in art, have no real talent for writing fiction etc, but I wish more people in India appreciated those who do and don't just dismiss it as fluff.  Hi Shashank! Thanks for this AMA. I am reading The Master and the Margarita currently which is the first classic I am reading, it also falls under the magical realism (*Jaadui vastavad*) category. So I am thrilled that an Indian author has ventured into that territory and will definitely pick up your book in the future.   
I want advice from you regarding Journal writing. I am sure you must have had some kind of a journal while doing your research on the novel. I have only recently started. What should be the contents of a daily journal to document your personal life to give a more thorough perspective on your own self and thoughts? you said that you are currently setting up a non-profit research firm focusing on artificial intelligence, in Delhi. can we know more about it? also, isn't book writing and this thing miles apart?  Thanks for doing the AMA. 

Here is my question:

How do first-time/ relatively unknown people go about getting published in India? 

Should the aspiring novelist being some sort of online following to get a book deal or do publishers go with the potential of book and marketability of the author? what are your views on partition of India and should similar thing be done in Isreal-Palestine What made you want to employ magical realism with your story?  What is your favorite fiction book? Also favourite author? Are people reading books any more in India? Do you see a downward or upward or neutral  trend?

Craig Murray (former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan and Rector of the University of Dundee) has mentioned that nothing of significance that will harm the interests of the US or western countries will come out of the Panama Leaks. He further mentiones that most of the Mossack Fonseca leaks will remain private and won't come out in the public domain like we have in the case with Wikileaks. And that the information we see in the media is filtered information.
[
Here's what he wrote](https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/04/corporate-media-gatekeepers-protect-western-1-from-panama-leak/).

> The main search they have done is for names associated with breaking UN sanctions regimes. The Guardian [reports this too](http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/a-world-of-hidden-wealth-why-we-are-shining-a-light-offshore) and helpfully lists those countries as Zimbabwe, North Korea, Russia and Syria. The filtering of this Mossack Fonseca information by the corporate media follows a direct western governmental agenda. There is no mention at all of use of Mossack Fonseca by massive western corporations or western billionaires ‚Äì the main customers. And the Guardian is quick to reassure that ‚Äúmuch of the leaked material will remain private.‚Äù

> The leak is being managed by the grandly but laughably named ‚ÄúInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists‚Äù, which is funded and organised entirely by the USA‚Äôs Center for Public Integrity. Their [funders include](https://www.publicintegrity.org/about/our-work/supporters)

> - Ford Foundation
> - Carnegie Endowment
> - Rockefeller Family Fund
> - W K Kellogg Foundation
> - Open Society Foundation (Soros)

> among many others. Do not expect a genuine expose of western capitalism. The dirty secrets of western corporations will remain unpublished.

>Expect hits at Russia, Iran and Syria and some tiny ‚Äúbalancing‚Äù western country like Iceland. A superannuated UK peer or two will be sacrificed ‚Äì someone already with dementia.

I'm no conspiracy nut but it did set me thinking. 

- What are your thoughts on this?

- Why hasn't this leak been made public (searchable) as is the case with Wikileaks.

EDIT: AMA closed within an hour? Dang! Hi, Thanks for the AMA.

1. Were you given the entire 2 odd TB of data? Or was it more India specific?

2. How did you you shift through the data? Was any tool involved? Was it a simple ctrl+f to find the relevant names?

3. What did you check the data against? do you have a list of names of prominent people or is any Indian sounding name is flagged?

4. Do you have the actual numbers in terms of the amount that was involved? Person opened an account would definitely be fishy, but if there were actual big transactions that would really put them in the dock.

5. Is this data actionable on its own, as in can the Govt/court put someone behind bars since their name popped up in this list?

6. Lastly, can we expect any big names in the future? This leak is a pretty huge deal, but the impact is not as huge as one would have expected. Impact in terms of follow ups by other news agencies, by Government and by political parties.

* Do you guys agree? If yes, then :
* Are you guys disappointed with this?
* Why do you think this is the case?

 Thank you for doing this AMA!

1) Was it legal to float an overseas company, when these individuals did it? If it was legal, were their investments within limits?
(Especially in Amitabh's case.)

2) How the money was moved abroad without coming into the notice of tax authorities? So how were you guys first contacted about this? 

  What were your initial reactions when you guys went through the data? 

  What do you think the affect of this leak have in India? 


  Lastly, don't you guys think that something is fishy about how there are no US names in the data? 

  I don't care about my shitty English :)  This question is not related to Panama expose'. But about newspapers in general.

When Press breaks a big story, it is in front page in capital letters.

When it turns out to be false, the retraction is always in a an obscure corner in an inside page.

This is the case most of the time.

Why? Hello,

Thank you for doing this. I really admire what this team and the newspaper did.

I have two questions. 

1) You have named some big names and, as far as I can see, the effect has not been that noteworthy. The government has initiated a probe but it might be like the SIT they formed earlier.

*Do you think there will be actual action taken against tax evaders?*

2) I wanted to know what you think about the recent [changes in the FCRA](http://thewire.in/2016/04/02/revealed-jaitley-gifts-bjp-congress-a-clean-chit-retrospectively-on-fcra-violation-27134/). I find it strange that they are doing this retrospectively.

*Does this mean that contribution to political parties even from offshore accounts will be seen as legal?* [removed] I have always felt that media lags in adoption of technology. But with this volume of data, it would have been impossible to go through it without using cutting edge search methods and machine learning / natural language processing.

* So, did you use these methods?
* Has Indian Express started investing in technology? Why haven't you guys disclosed all the names on the list? Some of the off shore accounts must belong to Politicians or Political Parties, but unlikely to be registered in a their own names. Can we expect an investigation and link up through informed research?

The current Govt is trying to encourage the Indian Pvt sector to play a major role in the defense sector. However, several Pvt. sector companies are of the opinion that as long as DPSUs exist major defense contracts will always be awarded to the DPSU.

In your experience what should the Govt of India do to ensure a level playing field for both DPSUs & Pvt. Indian companies?

Many Thanks,
Debajit Damn, 26 years in the army and 15 as a journalist!? Surprised! It feels like I've been seeing you cover war zones forever! Thanks for being here. I have 2 questions. 

__________
I remember you reported events for Indian news channels from Afghanistan during the post 9/11 US intervention there.  So a question from that region. 

Why isn't India building Active Military Bases there since we have one in some capacity in Tajikistan of all places.  
There can't be a reason that it will antagonize *Someone* because they are already antagonized regardless. So whats the delay. 

______

And Why can't India instead of whining/worried about CPEC actually counter-compete with CPEC in economic terms by extending its Himachal-Ladakh sector Alternative Supply route that India is currently building/planning(to limit its reliance on the high risk Valley route) and extend it into Central Asia and Russia.   

East of Pamirs instead of West as has been the dream since Independence.  
Link this with a Delhi-Mumbai Corridor and a port in Gujarat-Maharashtra.  
All of these are already getting build anyway by India so it can't really be argued its too expensive, so why not extent it just a bit?  

China wouldn't really have many qualms(after some convincing) since its always about money with them primarily, plus this will get linked with their Belt Section of OBOR (its not like India isn't part of it anyway, there is the BCIM already so India is already tapped in, plus the AIIB/NDB funding)so they have that incentive plus greater energy security for them (their primary reason for CPEC in Pakistan to begin with) and also them feeling less leveraged by Pakistan bilaterally (all these are factors which will be attractive to China, strategically in the long term) and given that /Central Asian/SCO members will more than welcome the massive market right on their door steps, i.e. North India.    

What is wrong with this? 

I hope you don't mind the long winded question/suggestion.  

Thanks. 
 Hi Ajai, it's Tejpal :)

1) How likely do you feel a Rafale Make In India is? A BJP spokesperson has mentioned it and there is most definitely a need for it + the Indian Navy are looking to purchase it for their INS Vishal too, no? It makes sense to shift a production line to India and produce it in far larger numbers.

2) Leading me on to this question, by 2030, there will be 210+ Jaguars/MiG-29UPGs/Mirage-2000s that will need replacing or near retiring + there are 100+ MiG-27s that need retiring imminently. The replacement for the near 250 MiG-21s whilst increasing squadron strength are the Tejas Mk1/Mk1A and either the Gripen-E/F-16 Block 70 but where is the medium jet going to come from? 

The Rafale with MII?

3) Do you have any info on the AMCA? With ToT being guaranteed by Dassault/Thales et al and French involvement with Kaveri, surely the jet will be set back in order to accommodate for these improvements? 

4) Finally, with the Tejas, do you feel that the IN N-LCA orders and the current 120 Mk1/Mk1A orders will be just that for the jet or do you feel there is potential orders within the IAF/IN and export?

Thank you so much! Was it a right move for government to go public on surgical strike in POK? Would request you reply to Bernard_Wooley's questions. Also, would like your take on the Excalibur.
In general though - do you support India opting for indigenous products instead of foreign ones, at cost of some operational capability? Is the threat of various killswitches/spare-part supply denials a real one when it comes to foreign influence on India's military capabilities? Hello

I hope you don't mind my asking, but some of the questions have been about your journalistic experience, and this is something I've always wondered about:

1. Have you read [this](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/known-unknowns)? What's your opinion of it?

2. Which defence journalists in India whom would you rate highly? 

Edit: removed one question because you've answered it below (BeefJanataParty).  Hello Mr. Shukla, 
  
Two questions: 
  
- what do you say to the people who raise questions during the time you were undercover as you being AWOL and call you the 'col who ran away' ?  
  
- Given your personal and tremedously close ties with Congress (if you want I will state them here), how is any of your defence related political stand credible?  
  
This was an issue when you were doing shows on DD and it has only become worse afterwards. 
  
Just like if I see Subhash chandra, i know its going to be pro BJP material, its almost same with you but anti BJP.

"Hey /r/india, I‚Äôm Amrit, a Delhi-based social entrepreneur and chatbot developer. Ask Me Anything about Air Pollution!",83,5fvxfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5fvxfa/hey_rindia_im_amrit_a_delhibased_social/,95,1480617446.0,"Air pollution sucks.

I believe that clean air is a basic human right. We are a very long way away from having clean air in Delhi, most parts of North India, and around the world. Air pollution in cities across the country even the likes of Bombay and Madras are unhealthy (just not as bad as Delhi).


Shocking Facts About Air Pollution:

1. 92% of the people in the world  don't have access to clean air.

2. 6.5 million people die prematurely every year because of air pollution. That's more than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and traffic accidents combined.

3. Scientists don't yet know the precise extent of health affects of sustained exposure to very unhealthy and hazardous air quality levels, because most air quality research thus far has been done in countries with relatively much much cleaner air than India.


There is no reason why air pollution data shouldn‚Äôt be as easy to access and understand as weather data. I‚Äôm working to make that happen for worldwide air quality data at http://www.AirAirAir.org.

I built Smokey - It's a friendly air pollution chatbot that works in Facebook Messenger. It is the easiest way to monitor the air quality levels in your city every day, and learn what you can do about it to protect yourself. You can search for ‚Äúsmokey air‚Äù in Facebook Messenger app, or just click on http://m.me/smokeybot. It's totally free and works like magic for cities around the world in 33 countries.


Prior to this, I launched a simple twitter bot, [DelhivsWorld](http://www.twitter.com/delhivsworld) - it tweets out hourly updates to Delhi's air pollution levels compared to Beijing, London, New  York and Sydney.


I definitely don‚Äôt have all the answers, but I want to hear your experiences about air pollution and help in any way I can, especially by democratizing air pollution data in a way that's super easy to access and understand for absolutely everyone with an internet connection.


**Let‚Äôs talk air pollution.**

I have a simple question for you: Do you know the air quality in your city today? Do you wear a face mask? Why or Why not?


Proof: https://twitter.com/amrit_sharma/status/804274289201418241

What do you think is the bare minimum govt should do reduce pollution drastically in , lets say 10 years. ALso, what according to you is should be the ideal steps to be taken by govt what is the amount of CO2 u breath in a day in Delhi How has central government or Delhi government helped you in this regard? What did you use to build Smokey and what is the best place to get started with chatbots? If I am not wrong the pollutants are actually a measure of the particulate matter, which may be from smoke and also dust (this is what I read during the recent ban on construction activities in Delhi).

So my question.

1. How much role does dust play.

2. I have noticed that across all Indian states in cities and towns the dust factor is very high, I have never been out of India but people who have say that other countries are not so dusty. So could this be a reason for high level of pollution here? You said you are chatbot developer. How did you start? I am an enthusiast. If you could guide on that. Being a noob, where should I begin. I know Python, C/C++, JavaScript. How did you start learning it?  What do you think about the feces rain which we had recently?

What are the possible scams you can fall in these transactions that you should avoid and which is the easiest and most secure of all the new available ways of transaction in your opinion?  What are the most common and annoying misconceptions you see?  [deleted] Not sure if this can be asked in this context . Why not give incentives to debit cards (like cashbacks) for transacting cashless? If banks can give incentives for Credit card usage, why not for debit cards. This will help lot of people go for cashless transactions. 

 1. Cards these days have a magstripe and a EMV chip. (If they've read the RBI circular.) But if PoS machines can only read magstripe data, then the security features of EMV are useless. Post-demonitisation, the applications for PoS machines have increased. So my question is **Are the banks ensuring that the new PoS machines are processing EMV features compulsorily?** or do merchants have to specifically ask for the EMV feature. Kinda makes it redundant though.


2. **Why are some cards able to process International transactions without any problem, but most of them fail?**

3. I was surprised to learn that **banks can set a daily transaction limit that is below the UPI daily transaction limit of 1lakh**. How is this possible?

4. As an user of UPI, **is there any documentation of UPI that i can go through**?

5. What additional features do RuPay cards give me? _Just provide me a link to a good article or source._

6. If UPI has to grow then there should be no charges for transactions upto a certain amount. For example, 

7. These days the rules for digital transactions and their respective rates keep changing. Can we customers have a website with a good UI which can track all of these changes? Is there any such website?

8. In case of failed UPI or IMPS transactions or failures during money being credited back to our accounts, the money takes quite a number of days to return back to our account. The banks are clueless. What should we do then? What's the usual grievance redressal mechanism?


9. Why the F&*K, don't banks allow Cut, Copy, Paste and Rightclick on their internet banking websites? Like what sort of security do you guys hope to achieve through this?

PS: Hi, answered lot of Questions, Will start for home now and try to answer few more in morning. Thanks ",Vssx,AMA," Hi Vijay,

Thanks a lot for the AMA. We are running a startup - [OnlineRTI.com](https://onlinerti.com) which is an online service to file RTI application.

We use PayTM as our payment gateway. Our price per RTI application is Rs.99-199 and we see lot of our users from tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Many users don't have ways to pay online and we being a startup can't afford cash on delivery. As a result, they file RTI application on our platform and since they can't afford to pay we don't file them. Each RTI application is a game changer for the user and if PayTM can sponsor some applications on monthly basis it would be a great help for them. A very small marketing budget for PayTm but it will have a huge impact. PayTM is notoriously known for super late deliveries and horrible customer care. I have used PayTM in the past and I only opt for PayTM when there is really good offer or promo. And I also warn other people about this. I have spent more than 1L on PayTM in past one year. I bought them only cos you guys had really good offers.

Here's my personal experience. I bought a Kindle recently and it took more than 20 days to deliver. And it was damaged, so I had to return it back (no pick up). The entire ordeal took about a month. **Thing is you guys refund the full amount to PayTM Wallet, but not to the buyer's bank or credit card.** So I ended up with 9K wallet. Then I had to send many emails to get it fully refunded. 

What kind of stupid policy is that? Why someone has to waste time to get their money back? Or is this your business model (wink wink)

1. Let the customer buy
2. Hope seller screws the order
3. Refund the amount to PayTM wallet
4. Now buyer is stuck with PayTM forever
5. ???
6. Super Profit

and how are you going to scale and compete with Amazon, if your refund policy and customer care are like that? 

Also you guys have to be first in world to start a blog against customers and start an online witch hunt and include links to his social media profiles, exposing his identity. [Here's one such instance](https://archive.is/ILXiR). Do you even have privacy policy? [deleted] 1. Is there any special significance of the number (197)?

2. How does one enter engineering college @ 15?

3. When do you expect to turn a profit?

4. What is your net worth? How does Paytm manage such lucrative cash-backs ? How is Paytm going to compete with the design language of Freecharge?  When will PayTM provide an open development API for developers? Currently We have to contact with the company to get it. [deleted] When can we expect paytm wallet to be acceptable at physical stores and services? Are there any such plans? 

Please improve your customer support. That paytm customer blog was a horrible idea.  When do you plan to bring Recharge to wallet app, it is simple and i like it,  paytm main app is too cluttered,  so i would like if i could do Recharge from wallet app. Also every other wallet app has Recharge.   this is just a fyi sort of:  

* product descriptions & product images need to improve a lot in PayTM website.  
examples: often dimensions of packaging is mentioned, not of actual product. Products have several variants, but no mention/image of which one is being sold: eg 3-4 different lid types for thermos flasks.  
* offer banners on front page show very attractive products images, which are most often not even listed when we go to that page. This is immensely disappointing. I don't mind if that's the most expensive product in that category, if I clicked on seeing an excellent bed-sheet, I expect it to be available.

""even i am an alumnus of sairam engg college bro. you forgot to mention about how much fines they levy for each and everything. for eg., 10000 INR for being caught with a cellphone (also the cellphone will be confiscated), 2000 INR for being caught copying during a class-test, 50 INR for being late or taking a day off or forgetting the ID card, etc. the ID cards will be seized (which can only be recovered by paying 50 INR as fine) and the corresponding students will be abused by badwords (like slt, whre, bstrd) if caught talking to the opposite gender. let the world know how much black money they amass by such means. let me clear a few things here: mr. balu (the head thug : so-called campus incharge) has power to abuse anyone using badwords - be it the staff, the HODs, the principal, the students, the parents, if he deems it necessary. and you forgot the ""dark room"" where he calls students to lock them up inside and beat them up using lathis or shoes if he deems it necessary. every dayscholar must compulsorily eat their lunch (which tastes crappy) in the mess only and pay an unreasonable yearly amount for it, and cannot bring their own food unless they have a letter of exemption signed by mr.balu. no exemption permitted to dayscholars to come to college by their own vehicle (they must use the college buses only for which they have to pay an unreasonably hefty sum).""",sairam_alumni,AMA," I will reveal a surprising fact...

In Sairam, when a guy gets caught while talking to a girl, the first thing is, both of them will be asked to open their Facebook accounts, so that the administration will look up their conversations...Interesting na :D This reminds me of the college which was for women in Coimbatore! I took admission to this college from Aieee, but fled from there after 2 weeks!
The rules there too were similar and horrific! :/

Rules like, every wednesday you need to wear a saree, everyday twice there were prayer sessions, you can't own any electronic gadget and can call home just from two phones which were installed in the whole hostel!

Oh the horror! I was luckily to get outta there, but I pity those who continued there! ""No guardian will be allowed to meet hostel students""

Why? Just why?

Outrageous. Why did you go there after knowing the rules?  This is an incident happened in my college (Hindustan College of Engineering) nearly a decade ago... There was a commotion that there was a hot makeout session in the parking lot and almost all my friends were talking about it... I thought wait a minute, this happens everyday in secluded places till the girls curfew started and whats the big deal... My friend told there was no girl involved o.0  ....

Flash forward, my college (university) is making Jeppiar proud Im a former student of the college. Most of these rules existed back then too. The college management seems to be refusing this document was issued by them in media. I know a few juniors in college who confirmed that this circular was read in class 2 weeks ago. College life in Sairam is like a jail.

They have a saloon shop inside the college. You cant sport a beard or a goatee. No colored hair, No spiked hair.I didn't have a beard back then but had some facial hair on my chin.I shaved for the first time in my life at college. If your hair grows below your ears you have to cut it . You can‚Äôt grow long hair. They will ask for your ID card and you need to go to the Saloon shave or cut your hair. Only then you get your ID card back. 

During the first week of my 1st year in college i was stopped at the college gate for wearing a formal shirt which had white collar and white handcuffs. Apparently to them that wasn't a formal shirt. They told me not to wear it again. They asked for my id card and I had to pay 50 Rs as fine to get it back.This was just 5 days after me joining the college.

They have people called floor assistant or supervisor who stand at the college gate every morning checking every student entering who dont wear a ID card, has a beard or flaunt any of the rules mentioned in that list. If your caught they ask you to remove your ID card and you have to pay fine or change clothes or shave your beard to get your ID card back. 

If you fail in unit or cycle test you have to write Retest. If you fail in Retest you have to write Re- Retest. If you fail in Re-Retest you have to write the question paper 5 times. If you don't submit it your id card will be removed.

If you fail in semester or cycle test you have to attend special coaching classes every day after college for 1 hour!

You cant talk to girls ever.Your screwed if your caught talking to girls.

No mobile phones and laptops. If mobiles phones are seized you cant get it back until you finish 4 years in college. You have to pay fine. If you want to bring your laptop you need to get a letter from Head of the department and put an entry when you enter college.

Girls and boys have separate stair case and path.While entering college, girls and boys have separate block to enter and go to class room. Girls shouldn't come in that staircase meant for boys.

No sports shoes or jeans for both boys and girls.Only leather shoes. Even after you pass out you cant enter into college with jeans or your mobile phone. 2 years after I passed out of college I was invited as a Chief Guest to give a guest lecture to my juniors. I had to give my cellphone while entering the gate and got it back only after I left the college!

 Students shouldn't bring Non-Veg food to college. Reason given was that many insects and animals have started to dwell in the college campus due to the disposal of waste Non-Veg food items brought by students!

They collect fines for every stupid reason one can think of!

The rules in this college made me lose my interest in studying. I failed in most cycle test,retest,re-retests too.Used to fail sometimes even all 6 subjects in cycle tests.. yea even 0/100. Attended most retests, special classes from 1st year. I made sure I passed in Semester exams though.I wasted my first year.But during the starting of second year,instead of wasting the next 3 years without studying , i decided to do something useful, something I was interested in.I did some research work on assistive technology for visually impaired people.Presented my papers in lots of national research paper conferences and got invited to international research conferences in USA and Singapore. Once I failed in 5 subjects out of 6 in my 7th semester University exams. I was too focused on my research work and trips abroad I didn't focus much on semester exam.

If you fail in more than 1 or 2 semester exams, you will have bring your parents for counseling with college chairman and HOD. You are humiliated and sometimes get beaten during counseling in front of your parents. I didn't get beaten though. I had 100% attendance. All my staff liked me because I always respected them and didn‚Äôt get into any mischief. Never had a black mark. Im sure all my teachers can vouch for it even now.I scored around 83% during my high school board exams.I was just a kid who hated to study because of college but still loved learning. I had won many national level paper presentations and was one of the first few students from my batch who went abroad for international research conferences. So they didn‚Äôt have much to blame me for except for my marks during counseling.

During my counseling , I was humiliated. Chairman pulled my hair and asked me to do 20 sit-ups. Asked me to pay the sum of Rs.30,000 if i didnt do situps,which the management paid for my trips for research conferences abroad though my entire expense was more than 1 lakh.Just did what he said, coz my dad couldn't afford to pay it back because of our financial situation back then. He laughed when I said im not attending placements since I was starting a company. He asked me to attend placements and see if I could get a job first. I cried like a baby in front of my dad, chairman and HOD. Never felt so humiliated in my life ever before. None of my batch mates knew what happened during counseling. Didn‚Äôt go to college for next 2 days.I did not attend convocation along with my batchmates since I hadn't finished my exams and took a break from college. I didn‚Äôt want to graduate from this college. Some Professors told me I was fit for herding cows and nothing else.

Its sad to hear that these rules still exist and students have to go through 4 years of hell! I am raging so hard right now. I can't imagine someone ruining 4 years of my life like that. I will hold a grudge for my entire life. WTF. I also did my bachelors at Sai Ram Engineering College. It has been four years since I graduated and the fact that rules have gotten worse is disappointing but not surprising. But I must admit that I did not care much about the rules because of my introvert nature. I probably would not have socialized much even if such rules were not in place. Still, I hated the college (and similar colleges in Chennai) because of the quality of teaching and the way teachers were handled by the administration. 

In the department I studied, there are only one or two teachers that I would consider as good. The fact that some of the teachers were alumni of the same college made things worse. The problem lies with the administration which is ignoring the need for quality teachers and focusing silly rules instead. It is a pathetic state. 

I feel sorry for the good teachers in such colleges. They are restricted, over-burdened and forget about recognition - they mostly don't get the respect they deserve from the management. It is sickening. 

To people who say that students are not protesting against the rules, that is not entirely true. During my final year, there was even a strike/protest (whatever) conducted by some students. (Once again, I admit, being the person I am, I did not participate but quietly observed). The demand was to sack the chief of the floor supervisors. Nothing happened in the end, as far as I know. The protests were quickly snuffed out. The instigators were, er.. subdued. Parents were called. Suspension were dished out. Everything back to ""normal"".

I honestly don't know how change can be brought about. It is not as simple as students and parents losing interest in engineering because, the owners of such colleges run several institutions across several streams (engineering, dental, medical, sairam group even has a siddha college). One hope is that a new generation of private institution owners would bring about some change. But that is a faint hope. Recently, the chairman of sai ram institutions passed away. Now, his son runs the college, I think. But there seems to be no change here.   controversial opinion:

as a person from WB, burn down the building, beat up the management, gherao them for a day or three. Hire some goons, guy is from a political party? call in the other one.  Having spent a considerable time of your young adult life without interacting with the opposite sex, and then when you had to suddenly interact/ work together with them, how did you feel?  So I read all the rules and looks like if a girl wears a summer dress [such as this](http://staticassets.fashionara.com/images/product/141/131836/medium_S3AELEFBLZ500GN3S-EDRC5219G-84141.jpg) it does not violate any rules!

Was this loophole ever tried by any girl?

"Hi Reddit, i'm Siddharth Agarwal & i'm currently on a walk (~3000kms) along the river Ganga from sea to source and i have already walked 2000kms since 6th June. AmA!",245,566cwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/566cwa/hi_reddit_im_siddharth_agarwal_im_currently_on_a/,67,1475801415.0,"This June, I started walking along the Ganga from the ocean to the glaciers at 14000 feet, trying to present a very personal narrative of the Ganga and stories of the people who affect and are affected by it. The experiences have maintained my understanding that there‚Äôs a need to bring these important conversations into the mainstream. This campaign will help us learn and share with you stories of the people of the basin who depend on the river and what urban/rural/industrial activities are doing to the river.

Last time we did an AmA [https://redd.it/4saxeh] i had covered 500kms and was waiting to sort out some logistical issues to continue the journey. 

Current status :

I'm done with over 75% of the journey and it has been an exceptionally challenging task over the course of the past 4 months. For those who have been following the journey from the beginning, it might come as a surprise that i have been by myself and not accompanied by a documentary crew as was the case when i started (refer to previous AmA). Restricted by personal reasons and security concerns, the crew decided to drop out after they had covered the stretch in West Bengal. Though this affected the design of the project as envisioned and also induced a fair bit of mental agony, it helped me re-emphasize my belief that the only limitations are the ones that we put on ourselves.

What this has done though, is that it helped me survive longer on the road with the same amount of funds we were able to raise in the first round of crowdfunding. We'll soon be going live with a second round of crowdfunding, since the first round didn‚Äôt reach our target and use that to support the Moving Upstream series of projects, which is soon going to witness an expansion. This includes an opportunity for more young people to undergo river journeys with the support of Veditum India Foundation, to help us understand, visualize and thereby improve the situation at the grassroots.

Q) What is that one thing on your mind right now that you would want to do when you have completed your walk ?
 Wow. Do you see noticeable difference in water as you reach closer to the source? just finished gaumukh trek 4 days ago. My first trekking experience with staying in tents. Make sure you have enough warm cloths. Strange question but I would love to know what your playlist looks like as you walk 3000km Hi Asid
How are you doing? Rested well in Delhi? Do you think the last leg of your trip is going to be the hardest? What are you eating? How are you paying for it? How have you not gotten sick yet, or have you?

Sorry that these aren't the most glamorous questions, but I'm very curious. All the best 1. What are the essentials that you carried with you?
2. Have you undergone any training to walk long distances before you started your journey? Hi Siddharth,

1. Did you see any Industries dumping waste into the river?

2. Any village/town which you think is exceptional in keeping the river clean?

3. Did you see any dolphins? May be just me, what is the purpose of this walk?

 Are you going further to Mansarovar which is an actual source or up to Gangotri. Also could you comment on motivation or reason for this long walk. ", gprashant88 priyankish alps711 None mahtabsoin Molozonide pnj2345 uc_r vekkeda_vedi choley_bhature geekpirate1

Pranav

---

The Freedom 251 is the world's cheapest smartphone. It was launched in India by a Noida-based company called Ringing Bells for just Rs. 251. What's the catch? Nothing (as far as we can tell).

The device raised more questions than answers: the company says the government isn't subsidising the device; there's a Adcom logo on the front of the device, which was concealed with whitener; and the phone, which is being pitched as a Made in India device for the Prime Minister Digital India plan, blatantly rips off the user interface of Apple's iOS.

I'm here to take any questions you have about the phone. Fire away.

My Proof: www.twitter.com/PranavDixit",pranav_dixit,AMA," So.... What's the catch? Given that the UI is an iOS ripoff and the marketing content has been ripped off from Huawei and if this isn't really a scam and people do really manage to get their hands on the phone four months from now, what do you think Apple/Huawei's reaction is going to be?

That's a lot of ifs, btw. I'm spending my money on Pizza.

EDIT: A word. [deleted] How credible are the people behind this? Are the guys at the top of the company related to tech industry with experience? Have you heard of these people before? Who's spending cash for advertisements and all? Do they have good investors behind them?  Pranav, the company says that the units sent to media outlets were just temporary or 'Adcom' branded units, but the ones that will be shipped to buyers will be different. Did the company say _how_ different? Will they largely look and feel the same?  Most likely a government funded citizen-surveillance project.  [deleted] What's the catch? Obviously, no one gives away stuff like these at a throwaway price.

Do you have more info from the other side? How is the performance of the device, is it even worth the 251 rupees. Thanks Pranav, I don't have any question, but it would have been really good if they had cash on delivery option also. How do you think they can afford it to sell it@251?

Bill of material cost is estimated to be 40 USD. So what are they hiding?

Also, why don't you get the phone's hardware analysed?

My aim is to write 2-3 updates/day covering updates which for the most part are not found in the local media. 

I was recently threatened with legal action by a metro org for writing about a massive delay that has been kept under the wraps (even by sections of the media who I'm in touch with), but refused to delete my posts. I've visited many interesting construction sites - once witnessed inebriated contractors at 9 in the morning, and on a separate visit, a worker accidentally plunging to his death which shook me up for a few weeks. 

Ask me anything, except for my name or location!

Big thanks to the moderators for their support and hosting me!",TMRGReddit,AMA," Can you pls explain whats going on with the Pune metro? Its been ridiculously long and they're still in the planning stage, people keep objecting to the routes or something. How long do you think it will be  before construction starts? Is there going to be metro in Chandigarh in near future? Why there is a link between metro rail and Indian Railway near shahdra station? Could we expect Metro trains on IR network? In terms of quality which metro is best in India ? Hi TMRG! I'm a fellow transit nerd and have designed [some](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Delhi_metro_rail_network.svg) [maps](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chennai_suburban_rail_and_bus_interconnectivity_map.png) that you might have come across.

- What the story behind your interest in metro systems?
- Which Indian metro do you feel has the best navigation signage system? For a city like Ahmedabad, which has spent crores upon crores on a project like BRTS, it has failed to significantly affect anything other than traffic and construction pollution woes. This may be in part due to the fact that Ahmedabad was never a public-transport friendly city, so riding the bus is not even an option for most people, and for some it's a downright ""status"" issue. However, the population in the city has  exploded in the past few years, and it needs a better infrastructure to continue to grow.

For better or for worse, a bunch of BRTS lanes have been laid through the city. Is it possible to overhaul and construct a tram/rail network through these bus lanes? One advantage is that the lanes already go through the major thoroughfares, and so the potential rail can have stops at effective positions.

Thanks for your time and effort, I appreciate it. Thanks for doing this. From a financial perspective, how many of the metro systems under construction are financially viable and will repay atleast their debts? While I'm sure JICA does fairly detailed analysis while lending, don't you think their exposure now is huge? Do you know anything about the currently developing Ahmedabad - gandhinagar metro?

What do you think about it? It's being built on roads which already have brts and AMTS routes, will this have an impact on it? [deleted] In Bangalore, underground tunnel delayed connectivity a lot. In next phase, shouldnot they start first with tunneling instead of ovrerhead piers ? why do we have to import all the technology, are we really not in a position to stop them? why are metro drivers and staff paid that much when much is computer controlled?", None neerajgrover rroy14 hobabaObama pla9emad Glorious_Comrade snehnath sallurocks None adsraj None

Cheers and keep your interest in science alive!",ISROredditors,AMA," why is there no tourism around launches. so many people would love to pay and watch in person the launch. also why no govt advt to build up news. Hey guys, no questions. Just wanted to let you know, you make me proud. :) Well done on the GSLV, Mars & Moon Missions! Thank you for making us proud. My questions below:

* How satisfied are scientists at all levels in ISRO ? Do they all get to work with exciting stuff and how much internal politics goes on?
* Why is the online published coverage/photos/webcasts for ISRO missions so bad? For example: For the moon mission, there are were no photos for months, no live videos. Not much better for the Mars missions. There is hardly any data for stuff which should be easily possible, NASA has much richer feeds. Why is this ? Govt censor/security/red tape ?
* What operating systems/software do these missions use? Control software/onboard/desktop OS etc ?
 Hello rocket scientists!!

What nations approach ISRO to launch their satellites ?

What happens to load inside the rocket if the mission fails? Is there anyway those expensive satellites are saved ?

 And the most important question.

Kitna deti hai? What kind of qualification would I require to work at ISRO? Thanks for doing the AMA.  

I have a very long list, apologies for this but this sort of opportunity doesn't arise every day. Hope you take you time and answer these.  

In your own time, no hurry. 


* GSLV Mk III is equivalent to the Chinese Long March 3 and its variants.  
 Whats the time frame for a Long March 5 equivalent(14T GTO) and what will it be called or is called? 


* Are Indian spy satellites covered under the ISRO-space budget or under the Defense budget  

* Does India have a Anti-Satellite capability and if its kept under wrap due to bad global PR reasons, whats the shortest span of time, India can retrofit a solution( an efficient *jugaad* of sorts)  

* How correct is the statement that the 2 Indian Space Launch vehicles can be within 6-9 months be turned into a ICBM if its required?  
 I ask as some people question the feasibility of this whereas I was also told or read even a decade back that India is not making a ICBM to avoid sanctions but it has the tech.

* The Cryogenics technology took India so long to master because of the US-Soviet/Russian bilateral agreement and its implication on selling of tech to India. 
 How is US seen in this regard since its the stumbling block for Technology transfer to India.  

* What other Advanced Technologies is still off the market for India and what portion of those concern ISRO and Indian space development.  

* How come China with a relatively equivalent Budget in gross terms (about a Billion per year) be 10 years ahead in Space tech. 
 On top how is that despite not only this constraint they also had the Transfer of Tech ban placed on them, which i believe is even older than on India.  

* What was the Indian position in the 1990's on the ISS. The US and the West intentionally kept China out citing security concerns. Why was India not involved and whats the probability India will get invoved now given that the ISS will only be up till 2020.  


* Few years back the US passed a Law which bars foreign nationals (students and Scientists from entering certain NASA enclosures) 

 Has this(if at all) affected ISRO and the Indian Space development. 

* Whats the timeline on a Space Lab/Station for India (Chinese have set its date at 2020, just as ISS is dismantled and the Russian modules of ISS make up a new Station for Russians themselves)  


* ISRO mission to Venus in 2015. Whats new about it, what is going to be tested and surveyed.  

* How are GAGAN and IRNSS different, this seems to be confusing me.  

* Why is IRNSS only limited to the Indian subcontinent Only, Why isn't it Global like the new Chinese BeiDou-2 system. Surely the sale of service like GPS does and BeiDou-2 and EU's Galileo will provide is enough incentive plus much more. 

* Since its been mentioned that all ground hardware and receivers will be India made how will this be integrated into Mobile and such devices since such chips are manufactured at few places(near assembly plants).  
How long before we can use it in our phones? 

* How will the accuracy be, is using a geostationary orbit for GPS system efficient(i've read that such satellites provide limited coverage to only where the satellites are visible)  


Lastly, all the best and keep doing your great work. Indians 200-300 years from now will thank you guys even more than you get now.  
 Verified. Is there any message you want to send to the govt. of India? Let me know.
 Hi,

Thank you for the AMA. No specific technical question, but I was wondering what you guys think of foreign and often domestic criticism of the space program as being less useful to the development of the country when compared to other things which need more immediate attention and funds? This is not an opinion I hold, but I have read a lot of racist bullshit on reddit against the Indian space program. What do you think?  * How supportive has this current central government been?


* What would you like to improve on the government front that would really help Isro? 


* Tell us some interesting but less known fact about your work/Isro.

I am Tathagata Satpathy, elected Member of Parliament and Chief Whip of Biju Janata Dal in Lok Sabha. This is the 4th time I am serving as an MP (12th, 14th, 15th & 16th Lok Sabha). I am a journalist by profession and I am the editor of two newspapers, Dharitri (Oriya) and Orissa POST (English).

[AMA Proof image]( http://imgur.com/rrdJgI9)

At the outset, I would like to tell you why I am doing this AMA. This young man /u/kumbhakaran (*I wonder why but he prefers not to be named*) who works with me and helps me with my legislative work requested me to do this. I agreed. 

After hearing about this AMA format of interaction, I thought it would be a good way to know what people think of the present situation in India. Your questions might be a link to finding solutions to issues that are uppermost in the minds of people of a certain creed. 

Being selfish, I would like to use these inputs sometime in Parliament. I am not sure how this could help improve the overall situation (or solve problems) but Reddit could prove to be an alternative communication channel for me. I am not on Twitter or Facebook. I like the anonymity that Reddit offers. Therefore I have dared to do this AMA here.

My policy team, /u/kumbhakaran and /u/ZainabHameed, will be helping me with this AMA. They will also participate and respond.

**BIG DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this AMA should definitely not be attributed to those of my party and leadership. I am answering these questions as a citizen of India. All views expressed here are personal. Same goes for my staff.**

So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india community. 

*I will start answering questions at 7 pm (IST).*

EDIT (20:01 IST): Thank you Redditors for participating in my AMA and a special thank you to the moderators. If some of you still have queries, please do post them. I will try to answer them sometime during this week. Don't be surprised if you find me as a regular Redditor after this. Amen!

EDIT (19:53 IST, March 20, 2015): I got some brilliant points from Redditors regarding the plight of the farming sector. Yesterday, I had allotted the time of the BJD to a colleague who unfortunately, did not use them. I spoke today (limited party time) and used some of the points in the House. /u/kumbhakaran has uploaded the video already! After a not so busy week in parliament, let me try answering a few more questions.
",tathagatasatpathy,AMA," Hello.
It's good to see an Indian MP doing something like an AMA.
I would like to ask you what your personal opinion is about SC/ST reservations in political, professional and educational institutions. 
Do you think they still have any relevance, or has the time for them passed, and they are just being misused now? Do you think parties should reveal all data related to their funding? Thank you for this AMA, sir.

1. I read your [insightful article](http://tathagatasatpathy.com/web/Epidemic.aspx) about the spread of Jaundice in Orissa. There has been much research that uses mobile phone cameras to detect Jaundice, and many apps for doing this have been developed in western countries (predominantly for detecting Jaundice in infants). Some of us would like to work with the health ministry to develop these for India. How can we reach out to them?
1. Do you think that the short-term social ills that can arise from deregulation (like agitation among farmers and tribals) are worth it for the potential long-term benefits? To this end, what are your views on the Land Acquisition Bill?
1. The GDP of Mumbai is more than the GDP of the entire state of Orissa. Orissa has much untapped economic potential (tourism, food processing and manufacturing). Yet, governments in the state have not focused on significant pro-growth reforms - regardless of political affiliation. Why do you think that is the case?

Again, thank you very much for doing this AMA. I hope your example is followed by more legislators in the country. Hi, I am from your constituency. I live in Caltex square area. 

I wanted to ask that [last year the government announced a special job fair](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Students-in-a-fix-over-deferred-dates-for-job-fair-many-cancel-reservations/articleshow/42330062.cms) for unemployed technical and management graduates. 100 INR was collected from each interested student. About 3 lakh students registered as of final count. But, the job fair never took place. Can you tell us what happened to the money?
 What is your party's take on Cannabis decriminalization?  How do you balance editing 2 newspapers and being an MP? How different is the 16th Lok Sabha when compared to 14th and 15th? Better or worse in terms of efficiency of getting bills passed, the general behavior and attitude? Hello Sir,
An article on front page of New Indian express says despite spending crores the state continues to be in the grip of dreaded malaria. Odisha tops the country in incidence of malaria (36% of the whole country). Odisha is also third in terms of malaria deaths. How is the state government going to tackle this problem?

BJD had walked out of the Lok Sabha when  Land Acquisition Bill was passed. Specific to Odisha what are the issues BJD finds in the bill ?

Naveen Patnaik had written to PM to re-examine coal block earmarking process. Again specific to Odisha what issues BJD finds in the coal auction process ? Hello Mr.Sathpathy it is great to have you with us. 

I will come straight to the point. So here are my questions:-

Q1 Last November you spoke about Black Money and said ""Governance and Government do not change according to the political party"" Is this also applicable to your party i.e. BJD which is in the Government in Odisha?

Q2 In 2014 General Elections Narendra Modi's juggernaut swept almost the entire country but not Odisha. Their BJD won 20 out of 21 LS seats. How did your party manage that? 

Q3. When you were speaking on Land Acquisition act you said "" Nation wants to know"". A MP behind you was quick to point out the journalist with whom this phrase is associated. How often does such funny incidents happen in the house?

Q4 What will be your advice for young people like me who want to come into politics? 

Q5 and last question When are we going to see a BJP-BJD alliance again? :P >So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india[6] community. 

Glad to hear that Sir. This is a special opportunity for many of us (one that we might not get later on, so I know that I wish to juice as much info/views i can get out of you).

----

You've been the representative for Dhenkanal for the last 11 years.

* 2014: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal
* 2009: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal
* 2004: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal

**1)** What according to you have you done in the past 11 years for your constituency? And what have you done for the rest? (Please provide sources if u can)

----

**2)** In India atleast, LS RS proceedings tend to be a noisy situation where many politicians engage in hooliganism. Most practically scream at the top of their lungs, disregarding everything anybody has to say. There are many other incidences that just sounds pathetic. IMO (In my opinion) and I'm pretty sure many agree with me on this, It feels pretty sad to see something like this happening. I assume its supposed to show that the politicians are fighting hard for the people they represent, but to many (even if they support our own beliefs) it just looks like the politicians are shutting down every other other views. LS and RS are places where each of the points are supposed to be thoroughly vetted and debated. Screaming helps no one (IMO). Similar to parties walking out. I know its part of tactics where a certain group wants show protest, but not want to disturb political deals. Why can't they have a separate flag that just say they should not be counted while still listening to all sides of the story and participating in the debate instead of walking out on every thing? **What are your views about this?**

----

**3)** What are the challenges that you have faced (not political parties) that have impeded you in your efforts?

----

**4)** If you could create a law that would be implemented (that isn't already), what would that be?

----

**5)** How long do you think will it take for debates raging online to have a VERY sizeable impact in real life politics.

----

**6)** What are your views on the bad Maoist situation in Orissa? Do you feel sections of the proper Indian Military (not CRPF), and Air force needs to be brought in to deal with the Maoist problems?

----

**7)** How would you rate the practices taken by the Orissa government to boost Industries and Industrial growth?

----

**8)** Who do you think acts like an Idiot the most in the LS (in terms of impeding the processes of the LS)

----

**9)** How do you think that being the editor of your own newspaper has helped you in your personal and political endeavours.

----

**10)** Call out some of the bad practices of BJD, or acts that you don't like/support.

----
**11)** Personal question: I've identified myself as a gamer (computer gamer) when i was younger. I still do (but not professionally now due to familial pressure). We see tournaments such as the DOTA2 international which gives out prize money of about (67 crores ->in comparison IPL prize pool was about 25 crores), and many other such for a large number of games. The chances of earning good amounts of money in playing computer & console games on a competitive level is far higher than in most other sports, with a very large audience. And even in case we can't make it to the big league, streaming pays a lot of money. Yet everyone from the government at best does not do much to stop them and at worst erects barrier after barrier to stop people from playing. This is in addition to the bad rep that gaming already has. Many other countries have started organizations to help its citizens in their ordeals - (Especially in terms of procurement of visa etc) Korea, malaysia, China, Canada, America (in the process of creating one). Why hasn't our government even recognized it as a sport?

----

**12)** India is considered as one of the most trigger happy countries in terms of censorship. What are your opinions about that and also in terms of privacy concerns being raised.

----

**13)** How much do you think India is able to handle the American NSA and other such organizations that want to snoop on our (confidential government data + normal everyday data of its citizens) by their projects like PRISM etc.?

----

**14)** What is the question that you assumed  you'd most probably have to face, right before doing this? 

----

**15)**lastly what are your views about memes on the internet and on portals like whatsapp including ones that are probably based on you?

----

This AMA is on behalf of my grandfather. A few days ago [I posted](http://imgur.com/a/rQ210) pictures of his pre-Independence British Passport that was issued to him when he had to travel to the Middle East in early 1947. The post generated a lot of interest and people had questions for him and requested an AMA.

I've frequently talked to him about his experiences and he has told me bits and pieces over the years. It's really fascinating to listen to because it was a completely-different time, and it's amazing listening to someone who actually lived through those times.

My grandfather is 93 years old. He went to UC College in Aluva, but didn't finish his degree, instead deciding to run away and join the military. He took a train from Chennai to Lahore for basic training, and then went to Bombay for a Wireless Operators Course. After that he spent a few months in Hyderabad where he was promoted to Sergeant. 

He was then posted to Ramree Island off the coast of Burma with the 4th squadron of the Royal Indian Air force to help them conduct recce operations against the Imperial Japanese Army. After the end of the war he was offered a chance to be part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, but instead opted to leave the military.

He worked for Kodak for a bit and then was offered a job with the Iraq Petroleum Company, which he took. This was when he was issued his passport. 

Because of his age and because he recently had some surgery he gets easily tired and I don't want to exert him too much. As a result he won't be able to answer your questions immediately. But please do post them and I will start going over them tomorrow morning and will transcribe his answers. Also, there are some details he can't remember so I apologize in advance if he is not able to answer some of your questions.

[Ask him anything!](http://imgur.com/0m8sek0)

Also, [proof](http://imgur.com/J6yEqca).

**EDIT**: It is **9:00 AM** IST right now. My grandpa let me know that he has a doctor's appointment, but we should be back by around **10:15 AM** IST or so to answer the rest of the questions. Sorry for the delay, but he is still very interested in answering the questions! 

**UPDATE 1**: My grandpa is back!

**UPDATE 2**: Taking a break for lunch - will come back after.

**UPDATE 3**: Back after lunch and I've transcribed his responses to all of the other remaining questions. I'm finishing up now because my grandfather is getting tired (he's already coughing a little bit after talking so much). I'm sorry if we were unable to answer all your questions! My grandfather thanks you all and I want to thank the r/india mods for helping me organize this AMA and the r/india community for making it a success. I've wanted to collect his thoughts and experiences from those years and this AMA really helped me do that well. Thank you all again!",_vi5in_,AMA," Wishing good health to your dada ji.

 One Question I have about the 1946 Elections.

Why did Muslims living in UP, Bihar, West Bengal, MP, voted for Jinnah, exclusively .


Even though Jinnah had killed millions in 1946, while Gandhi just sat and watched.

 

And, Is it true that, Muslim Women did not like the Idea of a separate state but Muslim men wanted?



And, many of them who voted for Jinnah actually never left for Pakistan, why?


Did they voted for Jinnah for fun?

 93?! Damn, he looks fitter than most people my age.

What 3 things stand out in the India of today, for him? Your Grandpa is awesome. I want to know what was the popular opinion among youth about Gandhiji? In 1947, did the common people have a clear idea of what Independence really meant?

What did you envision independence as? What does he remember about Aluva? The manappuram, the palace , the park etc?   
What was the biggest scandals/ problems during his college days? It can be within or outside the college-social, political anything?  
What was the major time pass activity?  
How was the cultural scene?  Does he have any memorabilia of that era - newspaper clippings / any items of daily use?     
Could he tell us a bit about the middle east of the time and about the indian migrants there?  
What does he remember about 1947 - 1950 period? Any notable events in his life that gave a hope for a free India? Any event before 1947 that led him to believe that we are going to get independence for sure?  
  
Sorry for the long list of questions. I truly wish I could meet him in person. I wish him good health!  
Thanks a lot.
  
 How was the interaction between common folks and Britishers? Which political leader was he most influenced by during 1947 days and which political leader looks good/promising to him this days?        
Thanks for this AMA, Dadaji. Warm wishes for your good health. Take care.  Where was he when India got Independent?

What was the situation like (in south) before and after partition? Most partition stories I hear are usually of North Indian movement to their respective choice countries.

What are his thoughts about Partition? Good, bad, alternatives?

What is his advice on life for us? > He worked for Kodak for a bit and then was offered a job with the Iraq Petroleum Company, which he took. This was when he was issued his passport.

Nair?

Iraq petroleum?

2. Did you see any dead bodies floating while you were paddling? If yes, how did did it feel? What do you think about the state of Geology/Geologists in India? Most civil construction does not include a Geologist's assessment, and the 'officers' from the Geological Survey of India do the bare minimum.

Shouldn't be the big construction projects, in addition to the routine clearances also be mandated to get a 'Geological' clearance as well? who are the biggest polluters of rivers? what could be done to reduce pollution of rivers? How hard is to for someone to pick up paddling? What do you when there are rapids?

 I remember white water rafting when I was younger near Hrishikesh and I remember the rapids being extremely harsh.  Hi Kumaran,

First of all, congratulations on this amazing feat! The whole team is a great inspiration! This is some really great stuff.

While others have already asked about pollution and the such, could you share more about the cultural differences that you witnessed as against your older expeditions on other riverine channels? :) What got you into standup paddle boarding?
How long were you doing it for before you attempted to paddle the length of the Ganges? * How much time did it take for you to cover 2600kms?
* When and where did you begin padding the entire Ganga?
* Is there anything a normal citizen could do to help keep the waterbodies clean? (besides something like Swachh Bharat) How do you cross dams and weirs? Are there locks and stuff like there are in inland waterways abroad?

EDIT: Also, picture of your SUP equipment would be nice.

EDIT2: Gharials. Did you see Gharials? Great job,

Swayam started as a project to build a communications platform for future satellite teams to build upon. Early in the project we realised the difficulties of passive stabilisation in space, leading us to treat our passive attitude control system as a payload of sorts. Swayam launched successfully on the 22nd of June and has been sending beacons at expected times. Teams across the globe has identified the beacon signals. It will be a few days before the satellite stabilises enough to start with the communications aspect of the project.

10:30PM IST: Alright, thanks for all the questions! We'll head off now.",originofspices,AMA," Hi, I got nothing to ask just want to congratulate on your achievement.  Question from the previous thread by /u/AConcernedEarthling

Q: It says ""attitude control system"". Did you mean altitude control? 

Answer : 
Attitude refers to the orientation of the satellite in space. Many satellite payloads require the satellite to be oriented in a particular configuration to function properly. For example, if your satellite were to be taking pictures of the earth, the camera needs to be pointing ""below"" to the earth. Unfortunately, when the satellite is launched, it is set up with random spins across an undetermined axis. Hence the need of a control system to curb such oscillations/rotations and bring it to a specific orientation. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_control A lot of folks say (and I experience it myself in my work day to day) that the Indian engineering graduate is ill equipped for work because our engineering colleges do a terrible job when it comes to the quality of education they impart/quality of students they allow to pass out.

(1)What are your views on this?

(2)How many in your team have an advanced degree from universities in India vs. universities outside of India? Hi, I was the previous project lead, for a satellite that was launched alongside yours, Sathyabamasat
  
Congratulations on your mission! :)
  
Couple of things, how was your attitude determination done? what was your hardware? 

How many reviews did your project have to go through in Isro? 

which COTS equipment did you use? 



pardon, the single line questions..traveling now. thanks again!



 Greetings. 


My questions are :


(1) Do you guys outsource any of the work/module out side of India? (Non-Indian IT firms) 


(2) What's your stake on a philosophy of 'compete vs innovation'? What we can see from recent events happening in ISRO is that we're (we as an Indians) trying hard to earn a good cash by launching a couple of satellites together and stuffs. Does it mean that out in this competition, we're lacking in 'innovation'? 


(3) Changing from 2 terms of UPA to now, an NDA term, has ISRO (or you guys/your team) been affected in terms of monetary funds or pressure from any government?  First of all, congrats on the launch. You guys really do make us proud

Why do you think ISRO is not aggressive enough to get more commercial launches? I know ISRO has its commercial arm in the form of Antrix Cooperation, but I don't see it getting traction as the likes of ArianeSpace or SpaceX. From /u/eva01beast (in the announcement thread):

Won't be able to participate in the AMA, so I'll be leaving my questions here:

1)How much does making a pico-satellite cost?

2)What inspired you?

3)Did you take any help/have any mentors during this period? If so, who?

4)Did you have to import the components or was everything sourced locally?

5)What do you think about the future of satellite manufacturing in India?

Thanks a lot for your answers.
 First of all congratulation to you and whole team over there. I cant express my feeling how proud i feel whenever i read every mission you guys successfully delivering and making the world jealous. Just one question. How the talented people feel in working govt organization specially in india ? Any specific positive or negative thing being govt organization ?  What are the communication goals for SWAYAM?
 Hey! Congrats on having something you worked on in space! Few questions

1. What kind of guidance does ISRO provide to students is it limited only to having flight capable hardware through design reviews, use of testing facilities etc?

2. Do they ever express interest in funding a project (partially or fully)?

3. How do such projects initiate within universities? How did you folks found yourself involved? :)

1) Did she ever met any famous person at that time?

2) Did she witnessed any Hindu-Muslim riots?
 [deleted] Where was she staying during the partition? I mean in current Pakistan.

How did she travel to India? By train or any other mode of transport.

Did she encounter the slaughter or heard about Muslims bashing Hindus or vice versa(as they show in movies). If yes, how did she react to it? Hello Dadimaa. Firstly, lots of love and pls give your blessings.    
Question: People say that Gandhiji was massively popular but he also had a lot of opposition from people of various organizations. Also, many had ideological differences with Gandhiji (his non violence theory, not doing enough for Bhagat Singh etc). How was the ground reality? Were you people and people around you following Gandhiji or had differences of opinion or hated him?    
Also, which is your fav actor/actresses from yesteryears and from today's times?   
Much love.  Dadiji, was there anything you respected about the British at that time? Thank you for this AMA.

First of all, I wish good health to your grandma, blessings be with her.

My questions would be:

1. How was her life before partition, in a unified and unbroken India? It was not exactly calm as we know due to rising nationalism and especially with religious tensions in Lahore/Punjab Province...but how would have it been? Did she like it?

2. Did she lose any friends, family members and well-known acquaintances in the chaos? It was a tragic time indeed.

3. Does she recall the experience of the journey into the present-day borders of India? Did any violence happen around her during the train trip?

4. Does she ever wish to go back to see, visit or even live in, her old home in Lahore?

5. How did they settle back to normal life after the partition? I guess she would've been married afterwards.

6. Any contacts or family members still remaining across the borders?

7. Any particularly remarkable or memorable things that she recalls from those chaotic years?

My own grandma saw the partition happen, but from the eyes of a young girl raised in aristocracy and palaces seeing mass-influx of refugees and fleeing Hindus (and likewise, Muslims she used to know closely were fleeing westwards)...grandpa also recalls the street violence of his college days right before partition. What a tragedy. Thanks for doing the AMA.

What was the biggest surprise (if any) that she felt post-partition after moving to India?
